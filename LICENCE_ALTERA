The PORTAGEshared software is licensed by NRC to ALTERA Corporation as part of
the NRC-ALTERA R&D Collaboration Agreement for the project described as:

      The evaluation of the feasibility of implementing a massively
      parallel implementation of NRC's PORTAGEshared statistical machine
      translation (SMT) software into a system of Field Programmable
      Gate Arrays (FPGAs) where the FPGA implementation would have a
      performance speedup over the traditional commercial off-the-shelf
      (COTS) CPU implementation."

The PORTAGEshared software is licensed for the specific purpose of this
project, as stated in the ANNEX "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY" of the Agreement,
i.e.:

      6.0  NON-PROJECT INFORMATION: If, in order to perform work in the
      course of the Project, a Party needs another Party's IP that is
      not part of the Arising IP, a licence for that limited purpose is
      granted by this Agreement and terminates at the end of the
      Project. Any other licence must be negotiated.

      In particular, the following NRC Intellectual Property will be
      provided to the Collaborator at the beginning of the Project as
      Confidential Non-Project Information: the PORTAGEshared software,
      as described on pages 1 and 2 of this Agreement.

Please see the full Collaboration Agreement for details.
