                         Runtime translation server

This directory contains the files you need to install a trained PortageII
system on a translation server.  We call this PortageLive.

To fully setup a PortageLive server, you need
 - software (see bin/)
 - web service (see www/)
 - a properly configured machine (see va/)
 - models (built from framework, not from here)

Please read the "PortageLive Manual" section of the PortageII User Manual for
detailed instructions.
