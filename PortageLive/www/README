                            Web service software

This directory includes scripts that can help you reproduce the structure we
use to package the web software for PortageLive virtual appliances.  Detailed
instructions are in the PortageLive Manual part of the Portage 1.4 User Manual.

In this directory:

Before you proceed, if you're going to use the CGI scripts, edit cgi/plive.cgi
and set the variables in section "USER CONFIGURATION" to appropriate values.

Now run ./prep-file-layout.sh to create the rpm.build.root hierarchy.  The
files placed in that directory reproduce the location where files are to be
installed on the translation server, as is normally done with RPMs.

Then, either copy the files manually to your translation server, if you have
just one physical server, or build the RPM by running ../scripts/make-rpm.sh if
you are using virtual appliances.

Note: the scripts work for us, but rely on details of how the OS and Apache are
installed, among other things.  You should expect to have to adjust the
procedure for your own environment.

Note: If you are planing to use ssl/https, each place in the wsdl file that
has http://__REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_IP__/ needs to have https instead of http.
./prep-file-layout.sh does this automatically while copying the file to the
rpm.build.root layout, under html/secure instead of just html/.
