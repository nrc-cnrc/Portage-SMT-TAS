                              Accounting logs

This directory will contain accounting logs that get created when the Portage
translation server is used.  This directory and the subdirectories that will
get created should be writable to all users who will use Portage.  If they are
not, make sure the umask of each user is permissive enough to allow other
Portage users write access.  For example, if all users are members of the
"portage" group, then make sure their umask is 000n, where n can be any value,
then set the group for logs/acounting to "portage", and set the sticky bit.  If
users don't below to a common group, their umask should be 0000, the most
permissive possible.
