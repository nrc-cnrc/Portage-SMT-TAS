Note that PORTAGEshared has been renamed "Portage" with a version number, i.e.,
this package is now known as "Portage 1.5".  References to PORTAGEshared within
the documentation or the code are considered to refer to Portage 1.5, Portage
1.4 or PORTAGEshared 1.0 to 1.3 if the context refers to older versions.
Portage 1.4 or 1.5 refers to any of the minor releases (currently, 1.4.0 to
1.4.3 exist, as well as 1.5.0 to 1.5.1).

                             Brief Description

Portage is a project to explore new techniques in Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT), and to develop state-of-the-art SMT technology that can be
used commercially, as well as to support other projects at NRC and elsewhere.

The SMT system developed under the Portage project is also called "Portage";
this distribution for various partners used to be called PORTAGEshared, and is
now known simply as Portage with a version number.  Portage 1.5 includes a
complete suite of software tools required for phrase-based statistical machine
translation, including:
 - preprocessing of French, English, Spanish (tokenization, detokenization,
   lowercasing, aligning) and Chinese (handling of dates and numbers);
 - training lexical translation models (IBM models 1 and 2, HMM) from aligned
   corpora;
 - training phrase-based translation models from aligned corpora and lexical
   models;
 - training lexicalized distortion models, and their hierarchical variant;
 - using language models in text and binary format for various purposes;
 - filtering language and translation models to retain only information needed
   for a particular text to be translated;
 - adapting language and translation models to reflect the characteristics of
   the data currently being translated;
 - decoding (doing the actual translation, producing n-best lists or lattices);
 - rescoring (choosing the best hypothesis from an n-best list) using sources
   of information that are external to the decoder; a collection of rescoring
   features;
 - optimizing weights, both for decoding and for rescoring, using a variety of
   tuning algorithms, including N-Best MERT, Lattice and N-Best MIRA and a few
   more;
 - truecasing (restoring upper case letters in the output of the translation);
 - evaluation using BLEU, WER or PER.
 - a tightly packed representation of various model files (LMs, TMs, (H)LDMs,
   suffix arrays) for instant loading and fast access via memory-mapped IO;
 - a confidence estimation module to compute a per-sentence quality
   prediction/estimation of the translations produced by Portage;
 - an API to incorporate the decoder into other applications using SOAP or cgi;
   a web-ready demo;
 - PortageLive -- tools to setup a runtime SMT server using Portage, accessible
   via a SOAP API, via CGI scripts or a command line interface;
 - an experimental framework -- a collection of tools to automate running all
   the components required to train a full machine translation system;
 - generic en->fr and fr->en models to supplement in-domain training corpora,
   for improved translation quality, especially for smaller corpora;
 - lots of general utility code needed for the above.

                              Getting started

The framework subdirectory provides a template experimental framework.  This is
intended as a reasonable experimental starting point.  We recommend you use
this framework as your starting point for real experiments.  A tutorial is
included showing how to run a toy experiment with this framework: tutorial.pdf.
Even if you used PORTAGEshared before, we recommend you read through this
document, as it highlight the currently recommended procedures for using
PORTAGEshared.  If you used our old toy example as a starting point previously,
it may be worth starting again from the new framework instead.
