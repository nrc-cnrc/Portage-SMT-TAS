Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that my colleague, like me, supports this legislation, and I agree with the interpretation of his last reply.
It is not a matter of correcting what the member said in his remarks, but of putting a slightly different slant on it.
In his enthusiasm he made the point that this was fully available public information.
He gave the example of his own family and what a valuable thing it was to know about his ancestors.
He is quite right about that.
However the purpose of the compromise between the 92 years and the 112 years is not to deal with a family that wants to know about its own background.
It is where some other family wants to know about another family's background.
It is our job as legislators to deal with that matter.
This is where the privacy aspects come in and that is why I support that for professional use, for want of a better word, 92 years is a good time.
There should be some procedures for accessing the information up to 92 years, then after 112 years it would become a matter of easy public access.
My point to the member is that we legislators have a role and it is not to protect his family's information from him.
In the general case it is to protect the privacy of people who might want the information to remain private.
The Deputy Speaker:
Before I give the floor to the member, I would just remind the House that government orders has been extended by seven minutes due the time taken for a vote earlier this day.
We will conclude government orders at 6:37 this evening.
The hon. member for South Shore.
Mr. Gerald Keddy:
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his question.
Actually it was more of a statement than a question, and I quite agree with his statement.
I have no difficulty accepting that 92 years is a reasonable period of time for the majority of information contained in the census records to be released.
I would even go a step further and say we do not need the extra 20 years behind that.
After 92 years, to tack 20 years on to that and go to 112 years is questionable.
However if that quells any fears or any substantive issues that members or individuals of the public may have surrounding this, then I have no problem or difficulty with it.
After 112 years of not so private information to be begin with being held in secrecy, it would not hurt to release that information to the general public.
I would agree entirely with the member.
Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to show the support of the New Democratic Party for Bill S-13.
One thing I would like to highlight is the bill clarifies and corrects a situation which we have had with previous legislation going back in the country's history.
It also sets an example and deals with how we will handle census information in the future.
It is important to note that.
Census information is important not only for genealogical and historical reasons, but also for the decisions we make in the country.
In fact today there is a story in the Globe and Mail with the title, `` -- Census statistics save Ottawa $1-billion ''.
It reviews the census information over the past year.
The reallocation of funds are determined by the census data.
It affects social policy, government decision making about expenditures and all the different things we do in terms of legislation, which at the end of the day will have a result upon the services that we will provide as a country.
Bill S-13 would remove a legal clause that was ambiguous at best in relation to the access to census records taken between 1910 and 2003.
It would give all genealogical and historical researchers access to the records under certain conditions for a 20 year period, beginning 92 years after the census.
The important thing, which I think we sometimes forget, is it also sets the terms and conditions past 2003, and that is where we decide enlightened consent about whether we as citizens will allow that information to be released.
I have noted this before and I will take a little time today to identify what we are doing with statistical information in terms of the actual decision to accumulate that data through private tender outsourcing, outside government hands, to Lockheed Martin, one of the world's largest multinational arms manufacturers.
It is not even a Canadian company.
It plays to the whole issue as to how confident Canadians will feel about making personal decisions to release information not only about their age but also about gender and other issues related to their lifestyles that would then be accumulated for decision making.
Specifically on this amendment, genealogists or their authorized representatives would agree in advance that they would release only tombstone information pertaining to their own family members. Tombstone information includes such information as name, address, age and/or date of birth, sex, relationship to head of family or household, marital status, country, place of birth, year of immigration to Canada if an immigrant and occupation or trade.
It is very important for them to be able to trace those specific aspects.
It is not uncommon as members of Parliament to receive many different questions from people looking to track their family histories, for health reasons, for historical reasons about their status, for reasons about their own cultural history and background that was previously contained outside the realm which we want to now open up for them.
This is a reasonable compromise that has been achieved by the experts who sat down and discussed this very sensitive issue relating to privacy.
Historical researchers would have the public and scientific nature of their proposed research confirmed by appropriate peers or community leaders prior to starting their work.
Again, only tombstone information would be released.
The conditions would be in effect for a 20 year period following the release of the historical census records, 92 years after the census.
After 112 years, the conditions would be removed and access and release would be unfettered.
The period of 112 years sounds like a long time.
I hope we all in this room live to 112 years and have long and prosperous lives.
Maybe some people do not.
There is the fact that people could agree to have their information released but other family members would then have their data exposed.
That is a very sensitive issue for those existing family members.
I know I need to wrap up, Mr. Speaker.
The Deputy Speaker:
The hon. member anticipated my very intervention.
This will end government orders for today.
The hon. member for Windsor West will have approximately 15 minutes remaining when Bill S-13 is called back before the House.
Adjournment Proceedings
A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved.
Public Safety
Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House of Commons to advocate again for the city of Windsor and for our border crossing.
More than a year ago the government created a plan with the province of Ontario, and announced $300 million in funding.
Then later on it came in with a 60-day committee. It took the committee longer than a year to present what it called a nine point plan.
My question of the day relates to the fact that right now the city of Windsor has a gateway action plan, but it has a problem.
Approximately 9,000 hazardous material trucks illegally cross the border each year, breaking both Canadian and U.S. laws.
This statistical information came from the province of Ontario.
Despite the security risk, the industry and finance ministers did not seem to care about that.
We have a crossing for hazardous materials in the city of Windsor. It is the Windsor-Detroit truck ferry which is pre-authorized.
It is the only crossing in Canada where the data on the materials is gathered before the vehicles are loaded on the ferry and then sent across.
In fact this ferry service received a grant from Tom Ridge, under the homeland security act, because of its operations.
There were 14 years without problems.
What is happening is many of these hazardous material trucks are crossing over the Ambassador Bridge, breaking U.S. laws.
This government has entirely left the ferry service out of our current border crossing plan, despite the fact that it could be the quickest, the cheapest and, most important, the safest for certain types of materials that are crossing the border.
Recently we had the explosion of a gasoline truck on I-75 in Detroit, Michigan.
This could happen on the Ambassador Bridge as well.
There is no security.
The trucks drive straight on and anything could happen.
The frustration in my community comes from the fact that there are consensus items about the nine point plan that the government has put in place, but it has not done anything with them.
One is a pre-staging area where trucks would go to a certain area to be staged and marshalled through.
The second is the ferry service.
As well, there are pedestrian crosswalks and a number of other things.
Unfortunately, we had a recent tragedy where a resident was killed on Heron Church Road.
Despite the fact that we have had this advocacy for our community about the contentious plan, the government will not move on the items of consensus which I have noted.
Interestingly enough, the Minister of Industry came before the industry committee to testify.
He said that the plan was a package.
He said that the government could not do the pre-authorized staging area beforehand or anything else because it all happened at once and nothing was moving on the file until they met with the new provincial ministers and there was a municipal election.
Just last week the Minister for International Cooperation, the member for Essex, said that there was actually movement on the plan and that things were happening.
We do not know in our community from where the leadership is coming.
I want to know why the government is allowing us to break U.S. laws and threatening the residents of my community by the fact that these hazardous material trucks are on the streets and crossing illegally.
The government is not providing sufficient funds to get the trucks to cross at the designated crossing.
Why can we not move on items of consensus?
Today it has been reported that since 9/11 the border crossing has cost this area $100 million.
Mr. Marcel Proulx (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to start by reassuring Canadians in the strongest possible terms that dangerous goods are not illegally crossing the Ambassador Bridge.
Yes, the government is going ahead with major improvements to the border infrastructure, which are sorely needed and much anticipated by commercial and local interests.
The Governments of Canada and Ontario recently announced the next steps in the implementation of the Windsor gateway action plan, recognizing the economic importance of the Windsor gateway and the need to improve the approaches to the border crossings.
The federal government has committed its share of the border infrastructure fund toward major infrastructure improvements at the Windsor border points.
