This will avoid frivolous searches and will ensure the very serious nature of any studies carried out.
At any rate, historical and genealogical societies throughout Quebec and Canada are very well known for the serious nature of what they do and the quality of the research they produce.
They enable us to become familiar with a slice of history that would not otherwise have been known.
Often discoveries are made on how certain issues have evolved, ones with real significance for the present and the future.
This can stop us from having to reinvent the wheel, among other things.
It is also important to note that subclause 17(7) indicates that, starting one hundred andtwelve years after the census is taken, the information may beexamined by anyone.
At that time, the time limit will be up and all information availablemay be consulted.
As well, under 17(8), the information contained in the returnsof any census of population taken in 2006 orlater may, starting ninety-two years after thecensus is taken, be examined by anyone if theperson to whom the information relates had given their consent todisclosure of that information.For censuses after 2006, or in other words the next Canada census, consent must definitely be given if the data is to be made available after 92 years.
If consent to disclose personal information is not given by the person concerned, the information will never be made public.
This bill remedies some situations that were unclear in the past, as well as clarifying the situation for the future, which is a good thing.
It is a response to the wishes of those who want to see personal information protected when the person concerned has not authorized disclosure.
On the other hand, when authorization has been given, there will be appropriate time frames which will make it possible to carry out appropriate research.
New subsection 17(10) states that the returns of each census conducted between 1910 and 2003 or effective 2006 shall, 92 years after the census is taken, be transferred to the National Archives of Canada in order to permit their examination in a single location.
In light of the information I have provided, the Bloc Quebecois finds that Bill S-13 allows important historical information to be studied after an acceptable statutory timeframe.
Consequently, in principle, we are in favour of Bill S-13.
It will also help to extend Quebec's common history.
Access for archivists and historians, after a period of 92 years, will allow the production of better historical documents that enrich the cultural heritage of Quebec and Canada.
Often, one must refer to the interpretation of a period of our history, of our past.
With clear rules, a historian will be able to look for the most accurate information possible.
There are always political debates on questions of interpretation, but the facts will be there and the public will be able to make a clear decision for itself.
Many experts maintain that census documents are essential to historical and genealogical research.
I think they are right.
But where do we draw the line between privacy and the need for historical knowledge?
The Bloc Quebecois feels that while the right to privacy has to be respected, census information should not be subject to perpetual confidentiality.
We would be denying ourselves essential information.
For a few years now, historical and genealogical societies have taken all sorts of initiatives that have led to this bill, while ensuring the protection of personal information.
This bill will allow both objectives to be met.
With the passage of time, respondents' concerns about protecting their privacy will diminish.
Obviously some information can create problems for the living.
But once people have passed away and the next generation is in place, there would no longer be a problem because of the timeframe set out in the bill.
After an appropriate period of time, the public's right to access census files overrides respondents' rights to privacy, if indeed this timeframe is protected.
Given that the data are not harmful to those still living and that releasing such data cannot harm them, we feel that historical and scientific repercussions are more important than protecting the privacy of the dead.
Some people would argue that Canadians were assured that their privacy would be protected.
The threat of harm to persons still living is very slim.
The data could be released after 92 years or more often after 112 years.
Beginning with the 2006 Census, personal information could be protected forever if people so choose.
The Bloc Quebecois does not believe that the dead do not have the right to privacy protection, but the terms in the bill will ensure a reasonable statute of limitations, as recommended by a committee of experts including Mr. Justice La Forest.
Most of the data collected during a census are not confidential and those that are, such as income, can lose some of their confidential nature over time.
Despite the guarantees of confidentially made to the respondents, there was an intent to preserve data collected for future generations, even back then.
A good indication of this is the provision that data would be sent to the National Archives of Canada, as set out in the current legislation.
The Archives is an organization that has always had the mandate to preserve data for future reference.
We are aware that some people will have concerns about privacy protection.
However, this will dissipate over time.
This bill, after numerous attempts, will ensure that the goal is reached and that these data will be preserved for historical purposes, as historical societies and genealogical groups have long sought, while ensuring sufficient protection of privacy.
For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will vote in favour of this bill.
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed what my colleague had to say.
I know that he has followed this matter very closely.
As he points out, the two time periods, the 92 years and the 112 years, are one of the compromises that has been developed during the debates on this issue, the public debate and the debate in the Senate and here in the House.
My colleague heard a previous speaker from another party make the point that he was concerned about it and his party was concerned about it because it creates more paperwork.
That is the way he put it.
I had thought about that matter.
No one wants to create unnecessary paperwork, but it seems to me that in this case the paperwork only has to do with the 92 years. That is the time when societies, professional historians and very sophisticated genealogists are addressing the matter.
It is at that point that they will have to fill in some forms or sign documents and so on in order to have early access to this important information.
When it gets to the general public, the rest of us, at the 112 years, there will be no documentation.
As I see it, the material will then be available and we can go forward and collect it at that time.
I, like the member, think it is a good compromise and I would just like his comments on that.
From the point of view of paperwork, I hope it will be minimal but appropriate paperwork and I hope that the paperwork is focused at the level where it is professionals or societies or others who have to complete the forms.
Mr. Paul CrÃªte:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question.
This question was raised previously and it is a legitimate one.
One can indeed wonder if legislation put forward and the approach taken will increase the paperwork significantly, resulting in a situation where there will be huge extra costs.
Often, government bills seem to have been prepared in a mad rush.
We have seen this in the past, in particular with regard to terrorism, where they had to come back three times with the same bill.
In this case, I think the bill has been put through a fine-tooth comb, it has been reviewed by people who are really looking for a balance.
I think that the modern computer tools available will help ensure a follow up and appropriate management without necessarily resulting in a huge amount of paperwork, which stifles the administration of the act.
I want to reiterate that the question raised by my hon. colleague is a very appropriate one.
For instance, under the bill establishing the gun registry, which in itself is a good thing, the system that was put in place is so cumbersome that it puts into question the very basis for the Firearms Act.
This is definitely not a model to use for other legislation.
It seems to me that, in this bill, a balance was maintained.
In its application, we will see whether the information can be processed without creating too much paperwork.
Since, after 112 years, the information may be disclosed to anyone, there will be very little paperwork, because everyone will have access to the information.
For use during the period between 92 and 112 years, it is right to ask historical societies, historians, genealogists and anyone who requests access to the information to provide the reasons for their research, if only because, after 92 years, the census records may contain information on individuals who are still alive.
Thus, we must make sure that there are no frivolous data, and that no one is going to look for data that could be used improperly, for example, to ridicule a segment of the population.
Requests will have to be properly justified.
Bureaucratic control will be needed to ensure the balance described in the bill.
I dare to hope that the people who will be managing the data in the future will do so with sufficient common sense.
I am confident that we have established the minimum acceptable conditions.
One thing of which I am certain is that the members of genealogical and historical associations in every riding that we represent will be very pleased to see this bill passed so that the information can be utilized.
In villages where a centennial or sesquicentennial is being celebrated, the people will thank them for access to the data.
We are talking about the census and about writing the history of the last century.
It is important to clarify these positions.
At the same time, this is a bill for the long term.
It appears that there has been enough consideration, and we would hope that the government would have the same kind of attitude to various other bills, on which it does not appear to be taking the same approach, that is, consulting widely enough before passing laws.
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member gave an opinion as to whether or not he felt that the bill had hit its mark in terms of protecting confidentiality or privacy, giving us a solution to this long-standing debate and impasse.
I understood that there was an undertaking that the information would never be released by those who participated in the census.
I understand that the bill is now calling on those who have the legitimate reasons of genealogy or historical work to sign an undertaking, which would be developed as part of the regulations.
I can only assume that the undertaking would say something to the effect that any information that would come to their attention but was not directly related to the purposes of genealogy or historical work would not be disclosed.
I wonder if the member could clarify that for me, because it still does not explain how we would deal with the undertaking that was made in the first instance, that being that information would never be disclosed.
Mr. Paul CrÃªte:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question.
I will not repeat the entire paragraph I quoted in answer.
The government's committee of experts, one of whom was Mr. Justice La Forest, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, found overall that, despite the comments made in the past and despite the identified objectives in bills relating to the need for absolute and almost eternal protection of such data overall, various bills presented opposing views.
I will quote an example from the committee's report.
We have come to the view that the release of pre-1906 census records constitutes a particularly important precedent particularly when combined with the fact that release of the 1891 and 1901 census records occurred in concert with the 1983 Privacy Act.
So, jurisprudence and legislation in this area have evolved over time.
This year, with Bill S-13, we are trying to reach a balance to ensure proper and reasonable release of information for historical research.
However, adequate protection of privacy must also be ensured.
After 92 years, genealogical and historical research using data collected during a census can be conducted only with written authorization.
