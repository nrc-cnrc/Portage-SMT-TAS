welcome
are there any comments ?
i cannot say anything at this stage .
we will consider the matter .
this was actually referred to in the minutes .
i note that there are no comments on the minutes .
( parliament approved the minutes )
thank you !
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
no amendments have been proposed .
mr president , i should like to ask a question .
it is the following .
we hear nothing from the presidency .
nor have we heard anything , unfortunately , from the commission .
could we then look to you to see what is possible .
perhaps , mr president , we could ask you to look at this with the council and see what would be possible .
we all agree on that .
i cannot support this proposal .
the order of business for this week is thus established .
if we give the money we should also be able to say that we would like to see legislative measures .
that is unacceptable .
but that is not enough .
of course the same would apply to third countries .
we have not done enough in that sector .
we do not have very much time left before the year 2000 to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves .
let us have some real legislative proposals this time around .
we will not get the results we need .
but let us show an example ourselves .
mr president , clearly we welcome this report .
energy strategy is a part of environmental policy and therefore must be decided at european level and that is why we must get serious .
so this is not enough .
let us see the others .
with reference to the amendments , i have to say that the rapporteur has made an extremely important contribution .
you said it would be very soon .
do you not agree that we already have enough of those ?
that really is not true !
but they have not done so .
the debate is closed .
this request , this assessment , from the commission must be supported .
we need a change of energy policy .
here i think three points are particularly important .
nuclear safety policy cannot be included among the priorities .
mr president , i believe that the objectives of this programme are excellent .
we , in our group do not support nuclear technology , as you know .
i agree with a global approach on this level .
the commission can accept parliament 's proposal within that framework .
the debate is closed
it is about time too .
what is the result of all that ?
in the long term that is the least possible service to a common european transport policy .
they must work together .
they must share the same technical standards .
it will cost money .
without it we will not be able to meet the transport needs of the future .
the reason for this is clear .
the debate is closed .
if so does he see any reason or opportunity to take action to control it ?
the debate is closed .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
we hope that the house will do the same .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
madam president , a single market needs common protection .
the second point i would like to make concerns a completely different aspect of the programme .
one last point .
will those measures be taken ?
will there be really any interest among the member states to take these measures ?
the debate is closed .
let me be quite clear about this .
madam president , i should like to start where the rapporteur has left off .
there is global competition in this sector .
this is not the right way to go about things .
this is one area where we can actually achieve something , and i think it would be a good way to promote greater transparency and more competition on the market .
but that is how things are .
this is unacceptable .
i see this is an excellent first step towards community regulation .
madam president , this debate has shown that our communication was very necessary and , in my view , that we still need to discuss this issue further .
what are the problems here ?
what is more , the union is not responsible for all health policy matters , and this is a problem i shall come back to later .
the members of the committee are completely independent , and they said the commission was right .
and - something which is particularly important with new drugs - we have already put in place some of the legal protection called for in this report .
but this too is no guarantee .
it had nothing to do with competition or the commission , it was the public authorities who allowed it .
experience has shown that making a public authority responsible for something is unfortunately not always the best thing to do .
what is the situation here ?
of course the competition rules must apply here .
there was no more to it than that .
naturally a communication such as this is always the basis for further measures .
the debate is closed .
and what is today 's reality ?
so the results are all extremely welcome .
i know that we do not at present have a majority in parliament who share this view .
but i do not want to open up the debate on this issue , given the balance of opinion in the house .
i do not agree with everything in it , but it is better than many other things .
but it is not enough .
for these are our drugs .
and what do you do about that ?
we too have our drugs .
what is needed is an economic approach .
that then is the reality .
it is by far the most important thing we can do .
efforts must continue in this direction .
there is a need for cooperation projects between the different authorities .
further research is also needed .
we need more education programmes .
they make a very good case very often .
therefore , this common position is a good first step .
my view is that national countries must decide on their own drugs policy .
that is its value .
to my mind , the third point is of particular importance .
we find that unacceptable .
the debate is closed .
there is not therefore any problem .
we did everything according to the rules , madam president .
no , madam president , my group is with me .
madam president , i should like to support the amendment .
i believe that for my part i have been very clear .
this amendment was put to the vote once again and i made it quite clear which one we were dealing with .
we will not be taking this vote again .
that would not be right .
i believe that everything was very clear .
we will not be taking this vote again , it would not be right to do so .
everything was very clear .
i should simply like to say this , madam president .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i fully support these proposals to improve the community 's programme of action .
the most important consideration in all of this must be public health .
this is an extremely serious matter .
it did not say how the court should do it and it did not say what we should do with it .
this political dialogue has to be important to us .
this really will not do .
but i would quite like to hear about that .
the situation with the environment is no better .
therefore , i ask the commission and the council to take action .
two years ago i tabled parliamentary questions on this matter . as yet we have had no results on that .
could they get their act together and tell us what the situation is ?
we will take note of this .
mr president , i would thank the commissioner for his answer .
that is unacceptable !
it is high time that the european union did something about it .
mr president , i congratulate the commission and the rapporteur on this , but i have two problems .
they have done well .
mr president , the first assessment we must make is of the agreement itself . the compromise achieved is the best possible .
thank you , commissioner .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
it approved the guidelines for the negotiations and the way in which the european parliament would be involved .
it is clear that most of these measures need to be carried out at national level .
a public debate was wanted .
they must be supported in every possible way .
welcome
i just want to say two things .
( applause )
take note that this will stand in your way .
will europe happen ?
no doubt that is true , but there are three points which i should like to make .
i fully share this point of view .
the debate is closed .
that is also true for cooperation with countries outside the scope of accession .
enlargement will take time .
that is why the union has to adopt the appropriate measures in good time .
yet peace and security also means freedom for crime and terrorism .
our accession strategy must take due account of this fact .
those are clear words .
the european union provided help .
we want to guarantee stability in europe , both now and in the long term .
enlargement is not only necessary , it is urgent .
the financial aspects of enlargement will not be clear for some time yet .
with a little help from the european union they will be able to make it .
we are therefore in favour of enlargement .
we should make that clear to everyone .
it is clear , and has often been said , that while the european union has to move , so too must the candidate states .
it goes without saying that we shall have to help them in this process .
i believe , and i shall focus my speech today on this , that in addition to the economic and political aspects security must also play a major part in the debate on enlargement .
i find myself having to play down those difficulties .
do we want to make it happen ?
a successful intergovernmental conference is in the view of the commission essential for enlargement .
the council will then decide on the start of accession negotiations in the light of all these reports .
i have already mentioned that .
so the commission has already a large number of reports to work on .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place in a moment .
after the vote on the amendments :
i can think of no circumstances less appropriate to refer a matter back to the committee .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , on a point of order , i should like to move an amendment to the order of voting .
i believe we can then carry this amendment no 3 together , because parliament has already adopted it once .
at any rate , i stand by my opinion and call for the vote to be taken first on the amendment tabled by the green group in the european parliament and then on our amendment .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that has been achieved .
yet we voted against the proposal and did so for the following reasons .
the value of a european approach is in serious doubt .
a european monitoring system is out of the question .
two issues , in my view , are particularly important .
we do not want that .
i note that no amendments were tabled .
ladies and gentlemen , what a long way we have come !
economic policy , however , will not .
it is not good for this situation to continue .
we do not want such a state .
let us take the case of the fight against unemployment and external policy .
today , there is only one major power left in the world : the united states .
they do not exist .
we want the eu to continue to be an organisation for civil cooperation between independent states .
we might well ask how .
welcome
welcome to you .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to make it quite clear from the start .
such measures meet a very specific need , and we should , of course , continue with them .
but there is still a great deal to be done .
commissioner , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , ten years of effort - little to show .
that is why we must all work together in order to take a step forward .
we shall do even more .
we want to provide more help .
that is why those responsible need assistance .
for ten years , there has been nothing but talk , talk , talk .
let us help them to make that investment .
clearly , there have been many more .
no , no , no !
provide all the money .
does the money exist ?
you will have parliament 's full support , and i am sure that you will also have the support of the 15 member states .
we do not want simply words .
that will be the aim of our committee .
but we shall not be doing any of this !
why ?
do they not cost ?
what do we have to show for it ?
let me say one more thing .
i can understand that .
perhaps we have to look at the whole question of our energy policy .
that is really the question .
and not just there .
it happened only ten years ago .
have we really no idea ?
but we have not reached that stage yet .
but that was ten years ago .
at the same time , he called for the implementation of a responsible and effective security policy for times of both peace and conflict .
why should we question nuclear technology ?
we should like to know , moreover , as my colleague said earlier , more or less where things stand .
more clearly needs to be done .
we must provide that funding no matter how much it costs .
they exist all over europe .
we have had enough of this .
the technology could not go wrong .
that is not the answer .
the only thing we know about the whole business is that we actually know nothing .
we have to be quite clear about that .
that is just how it is .
it is about our present and our future .
that is the basis of our approach .
we need an international agreement .
we have one .
perhaps some people do not like some aspects of that agreement .
it also requires a great deal of money .
i believe , also , that considerable efforts have been made .
thank you for the debate .
so it cannot be said that nothing has been done .
so it cannot be said that the states are doing nothing and it certainly cannot be said that the european union is doing nothing .
the debate is closed .
on behalf of the european people 's party , i call for a vote in favour of that motion .
for them , there are no human rights !
today i know that only the peace process , not military action , can achieve this . '
today i have heard talk from many people on the floor of this house about war .
i hope it is not war .
in the negotiations and in the agreement they have already given up a lot .
we must look at the whole situation .
their approach to the individual states in the region is different .
and what do they hope to achieve in view of the american efforts ?
without justice there is no life and no peace .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
thank you , mr president-in-office , for your answer to my question , which was in fact tabled before the council adopted its decision .
this time the honourable member has me in difficulties , because i do not know the answer .
i ask for a specific answer from the president-in-office .
subject : decision by the us court of international trade
it is therefore taking its time .
i would like to make two comments .
this is a very important point and it needs to be raised .
i think the solution adopted takes account of two aspects .
i did not unfortunately receive an answer to this question .
that is absolutely unacceptable .
i think we should first of all deal with the agenda , that is , the first item on the agenda .
i think that is the proper procedure to follow .
there is no reason why we should not .
i ask you to take the decision now , mr president !
is that agreed ?
mr president , i agree with mrs green , as my colleagues no doubt do as well .
( parliament agreed to the proposal )
mr president , i thank you very much for your cooperation .
it always has been !
mr president , i have a further point of order .
we need him to give us a clear statement .
i must say that it is not necessary for the commissioner to be here , because we are dealing with another matter .
the commission 's task is above all to ensure that it has sufficient international funding .
the region has considerable energy resources , even though it also has major problems .
in this new initiative which the commission has proposed , all the various points of view , from environmental policy to security issues and economic development , should be brought together .
this is shown most clearly by a number of provisions .
there is no conflict between these two areas of regional cooperation in europe .
mr president , i should like to put forward two points which i think are important .
we may therefore refer to what was said particularly as regards the european countries which are members of the union .
the debate is closed .
it seems to me not only a british but a european problem .
commissioner , you said that confidence among consumers must be created through measures to guarantee health .
could not the commission make some contribution here ?
we must try to bring about an overall solution to the problem .
that is one of the crucial points .
in view of the lack of time , i shall simply ask two questions .
what would you have done ?
let me be clear .
we want this ban to end .
the special council meeting has now decided on three additional safety measures .
i think the commissioner is doing a very good job in what is an extremely difficult situation .
this cannot be allowed !
that is true enough .
the directive has been a long time coming .
and this point is really significant .
this is a very strong measure to be applied here , and i think we have not heard the last of the debate on this subject .
mr president , now for something completely different !
but that is the way it is with parliamentary work .
that is why we have tabled a number of amendments which we hope will improve the present text .
in this context i would ask the commissioner what the commission is doing about this .
with these points in mind , our group has tabled a number of amendments .
that is precisely what we do not want .
what does this mean ?
a very large number of amendments have been tabled .
amendment no 2 in principle and amendment no 5 in part .
amendment no 20 is also acceptable in part .
the aim of the proposal is therefore not to draw up an overall strategy for their use .
the debate is closed .
and that is also the problem .
mr president , what did they want and what do we want ?
i know that full well .
the rules which have applied up to now have no doubt made things better for the consumer in some countries .
they cannot all be wrong !
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
we take note of that .
( parliament approved the minutes )
monetary cooperation
therefore the world democratic governments must bring the currency markets under control .
they do not have the resources or the opportunity to protect themselves .
but if progress is to be made in this matter we must also support the single european currency .
only in this way will it be possible to move forward in this area .
the international financial markets now play a very important role in the world economy .
in order to create those rules it needs an institutional framework .
the only way we can do that is through rules and through international cooperation .
what we need is a new direction .
that new direction is cooperation .
the same cannot be said about the subject of his report , the international financial markets .
the commission is therefore in favour of increased cooperation between the international institutions .
the debate is closed .
economic and monetary union
it is a very relevant debate .
finally , we need to step up our actions in the regions .
let me therefore draw particular attention to two points which are of considerable importance to my group .
i would therefore ask the house to vote in favour of our amendment on this specific point .
i doubt it !
there will be a ' before and after ' in terms of the single currency .
i think it is a good comment on regional policy and its importance within the european union .
economic and social cohesion is what we are trying to achieve with regional policy .
regional policy is something we will need always .
mr president , i also welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur .
i think in fact that we all agree on this point .
the debate is closed .
this means , of course , that we must pay very close attention to this application .
mr president , on a very serious point of order .
consumer protection and consumer information are both very important , especially in the internal market .
an objective approach is thus essential .
but where is the benefit for consumers ?
such information would tell the consumer nothing .
why ?
we need to take action .
where are we ?
how could i not do so ?
we will therefore support the text of the motion for a resolution tabled by all the groups .
the debate is closed .
clearly , we can no longer look to the government for assistance here .
we cannot avoid this situation .
the question is what can be done ?
but my question to the commissioner is this : what is europe going to do here ?
so what happened ?
the debate is closed .
that time has now come .
i would ask all members of the house to support the motion .
madam president , i welcome the fact that this resolution is on the agenda today .
this did not need to happen .
it is very important in future that this does not happen .
that is why we have two amendments down to this resolution .
we do not think it is strong enough .
every case is special .
i would like to thank all the political groups in parliament who have supported this joint resolution .
however , i would like to make one point about the two amendments from the green party .
unfortunately , we will not be able to support them .
however , my group will be voting in favour of the resolution .
i will end there , mr president .
i shall vote for the compromise resolution , but in my view it does not go far enough .
both we and the un should take up this case .
it is wrong to do so , in my view .
the joint debate is closed .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
the agreement and other measures must be implemented .
nevertheless , we are very concerned about the situation in kosovo . everything is going in the wrong direction there at present .
- in kosovo .
i am sure you will agree that this should have priority .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
mr president , i would just like to make a comment .
at the same time , however , i must tell you that they will have absolutely no effect on the result of the vote .
the point here is that environmental projects do not always protect the environment .
things are going to change in the future .
this is what my colleague wanted to say :
let me take up some of these points .
the debate is closed .
development cooperation is therefore essential , not only in the eu 's own interests , but also out of solidarity with the people concerned in this area .
all this must be provided .
there are some very good projects in this area which are extremely successful .
but i wish to thank all my other colleagues too .
that of course is a long job .
i think the commission is on the right road with its proposal for a regulation .
this is where progress in the area can be made .
we shall therefore support this report , which is a step in the right direction .
is that what we want ?
because that is not what we are about here .
and that is what we must do .
this situation is extremely serious .
this would reduce the commission 's freedom of action with regard to cooperation with developing countries to far too great an extent .
we welcome the european parliament 's considerable commitment to the issue .
the debate is closed .
civil protection action programme
having said that , it is true that something is better than nothing .
i find this unacceptable .
madam president , i welcome the proposed action programme on civil protection .
certain amendments cannot be approved by the commission , however .
we have every reason , therefore , to encourage them in their work .
a programme of measures is , however , not the right place to establish views on what the intergovernmental conference should result in and we cannot therefore accept the amendment .
this situation will present considerable problems .
the debate is closed .
many thanks .
are there any comments ?
are there any other comments ?
but what is more important is that i am against the commission proposal as such .
it remains to be seen , however , how this can be achieved in practice .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
but we shall see what we shall see .
it remains to be seen whether this will be possible as regards trade .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
indeed , it is actually the subject of the first article of that draft .
this agreement can help in doing this .
i should therefore like to ask the commission to give special attention to this sector .
i very much support the opinion of the committee on foreign affairs , security and defence policy , including on the question of human rights .
we shall therefore naturally vote for the cooperation agreement .
the joint parliamentary committee is responsible for dialogue on cooperation and for trade and investment issues .
he has put together what we believe is an excellent report .
my idea is that if it does not come from the union it will not get on to the agenda in the right way .
thank you , commissioner .
he was a member of the committee on social affairs and employment .
welcome
( applause )
urgent political matters
the next item is the statement by the commission on urgent political matters of major importance .
welcome
i should like to deal with the honourable member 's question .
that is not the case .
that is a far more fundamental aspect .
i should like to ask him about two things he mentioned .
what precisely has the commission done to put a stop to this kind of measure ?
most of the comment i have heard on this matter has come from the agriculture ministers , not the health ministers .
we must keep that in mind .
what conclusion should we draw ?
i have three questions .
let there be no doubt about that either .
our aim is to improve the situation throughout europe , in other words throughout the union .
your question was not relevant to the present subject .
there are two aspects , which i believe are important , to be considered .
i would also thank the commissioner for coming to discuss the issue with us again today .
i am not quite clear about that .
that is another question that will have to be discussed in this context .
what are we doing about it ?
what does that mean ?
is anything being done about that ?
it 's always the same , you know .
and we do not know what to do .
five - not much of an effort , is it ? we asked for it and resolutions will be adopted , but what are we going to do ?
everyone has said so .
however , the council will be taking that measure into consideration .
the debate is closed .
i should like to end with one question to the commission .
i believe there is a point here that we really must take very seriously .
without confidence in itself , europe has no future .
it has the resources .
that is a lot , in fact it is too much .
the countries of europe cannot avoid the need to reform their social systems .
these matters will , of course , be referred to you .
this is our third objective .
let me quickly mention three of them .
that is what europe 's citizens expect .
as such , they must be supported .
special efforts are therefore required .
well , they are not doing so .
one of these days , the commission should ask itself why .
the reality is very different .
that 's all very well , but how is it to be done ?
you did not say ' the fight against unemployment ' , you said ' unemployment : the european union 's priority ' .
the only thing this commission has done so far on economic policy is less .
we accept that we have to have price stability .
there is no doubt about that . we are fully behind the commission on that .
we talk about a crisis of confidence . of course there is a crisis of confidence .
we must have confidence in the economy .
i believe that 1999 cannot come quickly enough because the single currency will play an important role .
nevertheless there are three issues which need to be raised .
it is not .
but there is one point of agreement .
that is why we must act quickly , but most especially in the member states .
mr president , our problem at this time is that we want to create the single currency .
as we have said , all this can have an effect in the long term .
the problem is how to get back to those times .
naturally one must agree with that .
first , let me answer a few of the specific questions asked , especially by your rapporteur .
now , the matter of employment .
without europe , we would have much greater unemployment .
the debate is closed .
that applies in the first place to job experience .
it is not clear why this proposal has not been accepted .
mr president , i should like to put two further points to the commissioner .
i understand that the commissioner has now accepted the compromise in the council on these points .
the debate is closed .
that has also been achieved in group i .
in conclusion , therefore , we shall be voting against the rapporteur 's amendment no 2 , but we shall be in favour of amendments nos 1 and 3 .
but in any case we are now at the point for parliament to deal with this in second reading .
naturally we shall vote also for the two other amendments .
i should like to end with one question to the commission .
in short , of course these proposals can be accepted , and they will result in the appropriate amendments being made .
the debate is closed .
i do not think the public would find this acceptable .
mr president , my group would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report .
the amendments are especially important .
that is a procedure which is appropriate rather for a management committee , for example in the agriculture sector .
the debate is closed .
i think it is important in this case that it is the committee on development cooperation which has itself seen that there should be a report about this .
i think it is important to stress that .
still , we do have the commissioner and his colleagues here , and they at least will be able to hear what we have to say .
first , there is the matter of children .
it is true that we have done a great deal , but there is so much left to do .
there are two points , at least , to which i would like to call honourable members ' attention .
mr president , first of all , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the report she has put before us .
our group , then , is in favour of the report in principle .
for that reason , i believe this amendment should not be supported here either .
the debate is closed .
environmental measures in developing countries
secondly , there is energy .
something simply has to change here .
the priorities are clear .
integration in the first place has to start with development .
it is also relevant of course in economic affairs , the internal market , transport , energy policy and so on but development is perhaps the most important field .
this could be a future issue .
mr president , i should like to thank the rapporteur for this report and also thank the commission for the proposals in the first place .
not only do i accept but i welcome the proposal .
i very much welcome your proposal .
the debate is closed .
i must therefore ask for support for this amendment .
what i mean is that we did not have any text at all to discuss in the committee on development cooperation .
that is the position we shall take as a group !
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
very well , we will take note of your comments .
( parliament approved the minutes )
but this is not an aim in itself .
in this connection , the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights would like to make the following points .
we are therefore against this proposal .
it is in the form of an instrument for security , stability and transparency .
i place great value on that too .
we could never establish the situation as it unfortunately actually is through a directive .
i think we will take a good decision on this question in parliament today , which i hope the council will also accept .
naturally we do not want that .
madam president , what we see today is a very good example of new labour .
i should like to put one or two questions to the commission .
the proposals of the union of european consumers have not even been taken into account by the rapporteur .
once again the commission has made no assessment of the social consequences of the directive .
and yet the direction taken is extremely serious .
changes must therefore take place little by little .
that is the approach taken in the commission proposal .
certainly not !
but i should like to make three points .
we must therefore provide for a review after a sufficient period .
what is now before us is a compromise upon a compromise and the question is whether we can really achieve anything with it .
that is not the case .
it is true , it took a long time for us to make our proposal .
but i think for the time being we are following the right direction .
of course that will not happen .
what are the main objectives ?
after all , we have the practical experience .
that is not the problem .
that is not the problem at all .
that is one of the consequences .
that has not been mentioned at all .
in any case this is the first reading .
let me present the commission 's conclusions .
that is not our principle .
( applause )
so that information to this house was wrong .
the debate is closed .
we shall have to avoid that in this report .
i hope that will also be expressed today in the voting .
mr president , many thanks to the rapporteur for this excellent report .
to turn now to the financial aspects .
true !
that is what concerns us .
that is why it is a good report .
nothing has happened !
the commission proposal is a start but it is not enough .
the communication is also a response to the demands put forward by parliament in many resolutions in this field .
it is now being discussed in the council .
thank you , commissioner .
statement by the president
they are not against europe but very often they no longer know why they should be for it .
today some people think europe is part of the problem rather than part of its solution .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
after the vote on the amendments :
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
these various proposals have all been made .
nor is it something the public in the eu want or demand .
i voted in favour of the report .
all changes must therefore take place with due regard to the social and economic consequences .
the council must take this into account .
we would further point out that we do not think the eu should take over the powers the council of europe currently has in this field .
this motion for a resolution could in fact have very serious consequences for the stability and balance of our european institutions .
i voted for the report .
we welcome this decision .
i voted for the report , but do not share all the views presented .
i think this question is best left to the council of europe .
my group therefore had to decide to vote against .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
why ?
with what is now proposed , we have no idea when that debate is going to start .
that really is enough .
we have to vote now .
( parliament agreed to the request )
he will no doubt say the necessary to his colleagues .
i would ask you to make time available for that , mr president .
the order of business is thus established .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
but why ?
that is my question to the commission , mr president , and i would like a reply .
the debate is closed .
humanitarian aid
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first i too would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on behalf of our group .
only on the basis of a common programme can we achieve anything in the field of humanitarian aid .
it was also said here that this is an area of foreign policy .
the debate is closed .
what is the situation at present on the world market ?
that is a step in the right direction for the countries concerned .
what we need is a reform of the un world food programme .
that is a matter for the intergovernmental conference .
what is there to add to that ?
i support him entirely in his approach and i thank him for it .
they are crucial if food security is to become a reality .
that is the objective of the present proposal .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commissioner has given us a most able account of her difficulties with the council and i fully understand her .
when we were the european community , one of the great policies was that of development .
i am extremely concerned when i see that the european development fund is not included in the budget , and that less attention is given to such work .
that is the new solution .
the second point concerns the implementation of these programmes .
i wish to thank the commissioner , but there is one point that i should like us to look at again together .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i should like to refer to the rules of procedure , more particularly rule 5 .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
we have simply proposed another system .
welcome
urgent political matters
the next item is the statement by the commission on urgent political matters of major importance .
what is our approach ?
first , the union really must make employment a matter of common interest .
growth is essential in order to create jobs . but that does not mean growth at any price .
you now know the rules , of course .
i now open question time with the president of the commission .
a number of social problems have also been created , especially in rural areas and in the agricultural sector .
so a framework has been established .
mr president , two short questions .
i believe this is the right thing to do , and we shall support it fully ; i hope that an agreement on this matter will be reached at the intergovernmental conference .
we have need to go further .
mr president , i can say that i am in agreement with what the honourable member has said where it is not in conflict with what i have just said .
we have not yet reached that point .
we do not want more money .
this is a matter of considered approach .
that is the aim of monetary union .
monetary union as such is not an end in itself ; it is the instrument of a policy of economic and social development .
that is how we need to think of it .
i think this is a matter that needs to be taken into account .
we shall be making appropriate proposals about this to you when the time comes .
the fact is that there are various levels of culture and development .
they know too that progress must be made in this matter .
the opinion of the committee on external economic relations is to a large extent based on some of the aspects he has mentioned , for example :
welcome
so i will talk about other aspects .
mr president , the green group will vote against this proposal .
there should be no doubt about that .
it may be good business , but it is certainly right .
we have just been talking about unemployment in europe .
for those reasons therefore this agreement may be approved .
and , within that dialogue , respect for human rights and principles of democracy will play an essential part .
the peace process was a good start .
some people are still saying that dialogue is needed .
there is dialogue .
it must be discussed with the national authorities .
we are speaking about an agreement which has not yet come into being .
let us look towards progress !
let us vote in favour !
( applause )
that is true .
first human rights , and then of course the reference to turkey .
no , it is not the same .
let us bank on it being very different .
let us keep the pressure on .
certainly not !
the debate is closed .
i hope the content of the european parliament 's resolution will cause our colleagues there to think again .
there is indeed every reason for doing so .
then we naturally think of turkey , of russia and sometimes of other countries too .
i support the decision taken by the council of europe .
therefore i support this decision by the council of europe .
the debate is closed .
true , it is a small country , and it is close at hand , but as regards development it is still a country which is a long way down on the list of world powers .
we must take that into account .
the problem is to find the most effective and appropriate strategy now to end this crisis .
that is the real question !
no !
the debate is closed .
the environment committee is particularly concerned about the impact of road transport on the environment .
it is a good basis .
on that we are agreed .
there are a few things left out of the commission 's action programme .
in that connection i should like to point out three areas for attention .
as you know , that was the period for which i still had some responsibility .
i should like to refer to various points made , but unfortunately we do not have the time .
in some sectors the position is better .
but unfortunately that too is a long time ago .
that was how we received our first funds .
parliament together with the commission have always had to fight the council to get the money needed .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
they were important amendments , and i shall mention only the most important three .
my group will support them .
so let us regard this proposal as a first step in the right direction , though not perhaps the last .
naturally it is not the first time this matter has been discussed here in parliament , but we are in fact close to taking a further step in the right direction .
but i thank parliament for giving the commission its support at first reading .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
they can also play a significant role in the future too .
the commission 's green paper is a welcome document .
that is the culture we have to encourage .
this problem is currently the main concern of the european union .
in this respect , i believe that three particularly important points are made in the green paper .
close coordination of research efforts is necessary .
thank you .
as you know , i fully share this concern .
the debate is closed .
i welcome that .
nor was it the only one to be in that situation , because of the provisions adopted in the third framework programme .
the debate is closed .
some of them , as you know , are discussed here in the house too .
thank you very much .
a great deal has been said today about all these points .
overall , then , the commission can only express its agreement .
the debate is closed .
financial instrument for the environment ( life )
on behalf of my group i very much welcome that .
but if that is mentioned as a priority , commissioner , we must also be prepared to find the necessary resources .
we should like to draw attention to two of them .
mr president , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
in particular , i should like to report on the events that have taken place in the last few days and over the past week .
( applause )
what is to be done ?
so how and what do we decide ?
now i want to ask him if there are sufficient resources to guarantee this action .
we hope so !
then there are the economic measures .
it is time for those of her colleagues who share her concern to follow her example .
let them put principle above party .
( applause )
it is certainly not before time .
what a position for any government to put its own ministers in !
where is it all going to end ?
it created this problem and europe is now having to pay the price .
the commission should know that .
it therefore seems to us essential that the commission should place all the information available before the european parliament and before public opinion .
commissioner , the health of consumers is the first consideration .
we must not play with these things .
mr president , i would like colleagues to focus on what we do now and next week .
the final point i would like to make is one which i have made before and will continue to make .
but one thing is clear .
the debate is closed .
our thanks go to the commission for that .
that is moreover the view of the committee on legal affairs too .
that is why we shall not vote for this agreement .
the debate is closed .
i have my own opinion on the matter .
therefore i cannot support this agreement .
for this reason we will vote against the report .
a number of instruments have , indeed , already been established since that date .
in view of the above we are voting against the report .
i hope the commission will support the point of view of the european parliament 's committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
i shall therefore vote in favour .
for the same reason it is also the first time the question has been raised in the european parliament and the council of ministers .
well , that is a matter of responsibility .
madam president , i voted against the resolution .
that should have been our aim .
statement by the president
( applause )
again , mr president , thank you for your statement .
welcome
you are very welcome !
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
mr president , i should like to give an account of something that happened recently and ask the presidency about it .
can you give me any information on this matter , mr president ?
i could not see that what you were saying had anything to do with the order of business .
you will also then receive a reply .
for this week , there are no amendments .
( parliament approved the request ) the order of business is thus established .
i would like to congratulate him on the quality of the work he has done .
i hope these matters will have strong support in the house tomorrow .
there should also be a concern to promote a model of sustainable development .
and , in our opinion , the focus no longer is right .
even though money is not all that is needed here , it certainly does help !
i know that this is a matter of concern to a great many of you .
it is also a concern that i share .
i should also like to stress an important point in this context .
such a compromise must be our objective .
we now have to take the council with us .
the debate is closed .
mr president , members will be aware that we have already been through the general aspects of this report in the first reading .
the technology is available , and the sector should make use of it .
europe is far behind .
the debate is closed .
mr president , together with my colleagues , i very much welcome the initiative taken by the commission in this area .
enough of that , however ; let us now turn to the report .
it is very important for the commission and the council to be aware of this .
if we are serious about this , then decisions are the order of the day .
my second area of interest is the environment .
with just a few amendments , the commission 's guidelines and action programme will be extremely effective .
we should therefore support this amendment .
the debate is closed .
and the negotiations will of course therefore be difficult .
we have had quite enough of that .
this is a global problem and it needs a global solution .
i believe that is quite crucial to the future course of our debate .
i think not .
what does the commission think about this ?
there is every reason to promote this in other countries in the union .
there are a few points which i should like to make about some of what has been said .
why can you not try something like this ?
does this proposal exist , or does it not ?
is it a basis for discussion ?
that is not true .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
the groups have to meet .
if we do not agree to urgent procedure , it will take longer still for this money even to reach the start of the administrative process .
the next item is the joint debate on :
what instruments do we have to prevent this ?
that is very important , and it is also very important that we should do so by a large majority .
we need a change of direction here .
i hope we shall decide by a large majority that this cannot go on .
in particular , i want to refer to the guidelines as approved by the council .
why did it do that ?
why ?
the council text is completely unacceptable to this house .
( applause from the left )
and why is this so ?
what is the council 's view ?
it is a subject we have been talking about ever since i have been in the house .
what are the consequences which we can all see ?
is the single currency good ?
to my mind , however , it is not enough to carry on as before .
first of all we doubt just how effective such a tax would really be , and it is not even a good idea in the first place .
mr president , on a point of order .
this is a political and not a technical problem .
the commission and council must do more here .
but if we are to do so , we cannot accept the economic guidelines being proposed by the council and the commission .
we know that growth does not guarantee jobs but without growth jobs will not be created at all .
mr president , we are here to discuss a common project , the single european currency , and its next stage .
large member states play a significant role in this .
the interest rate is a good example of the above .
namely , the relations between the member states in the first group and those which remain outside .
and , of course , that is just as it should be .
my reply to this is simply that there is hope , for a number of reasons .
finally , a few words about unemployment .
the issue of employment is a priority for the european union .
i should like to thank the president-in-office .
we also need to set up a second european monetary system .
these are two very important points .
it is a political priority , and as such should be the focus of our concern .
let me just mention three other points which i feel are important , and which reply to some of the questions raised this morning .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but at least let us put it in .
madam president , i have a comment to make about the voting order .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
in view of the above i am voting against the report in the final vote .
from a democratic point of view the european central bank is unacceptable .
this is not only true with regard to the eu 's member states , however , but also with regard to those countries outside the union , of which there are far more .
this is not a policy i can support .
why ?
fisheries
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the industry as a whole must improve its systems of information and communication .
finally , i should like to say that i hope we can have a debate on how this instrument can be applied .
i should like to thank the commission and the members of the committee on fisheries for their cooperation .
what do we have in terms of a solution ?
that will not work .
mr president , with regard to the report on the crisis in the fishing industry , i should like to make a number of comments .
so i hope that she will support our amendment now .
what are these priorities ?
in my opinion , something is not right in this sector .
nothing has been done there by the commission .
we must point to a more positive future .
we have not been presented with specific measures as yet .
it makes little sense to me .
that is unacceptable , because the rules must be the same for everyone .
now there is much that we can do here and much that the commission and the various member states ' governments could do .
in many cases the research is already there .
mr president , i welcome the commissioner .
that is something we must look at .
that is the major issue we must face .
she is right .
there is a crisis in the fishing industry of europe .
in those terms , i consider this a positive aspect at least .
that is just what we are not doing !
there is a very serious situation in ireland .
the problem is not a new one , therefore .
the debate is closed .
what does that mean ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i really do believe that the directive being discussed today at first reading is a very important one .
but it will no doubt do so over the next few days , or indeed at our sitting today or tomorrow .
i simply do not understand it .
the next item is question time .
question time ( commission )
i thank the commissioner for his reply .
i have a few points .
i thank the honourable member for his interest in this matter .
is it a priority of the commission ?
thank you for your answer .
thank you for your answer , commissioner .
the honourable member is absolutely right .
this is a very strong principle .
thank you for the question because it is an important one .
subject : development aid policy
what is the commission 's position on this problem ?
i therefore believe that my question still requires an answer .
why have we done this ?
subject : implementation of the guidelines on aid to employment
which member states have done so ?
subject : competition rules
therefore , i cannot be more specific .
that is why we have competition rules and a competition authority which , as you know , is the commission .
let me just say one thing .
so it is already possible for a national government to take that step .
your answer was not a very specific one , commissioner .
this consideration must be taken into account , i believe , in the proposals for 1998 , to which the commissioner has just referred .
we shall be able to discuss this with one another .
we cannot discuss the matter on this basis .
i thank the commissioner for his answer .
so i believe that it is important for the commission to take this very seriously .
it goes without saying that the commission is prepared to take decisions on measures under any directive , but we do need a request from the government responsible .
1 )
i should like to make two comments concerning this text .
for let no one doubt the fact : european integration must be based on the rule of law .
europe will be a community of law , or it will be nothing .
i am coming to the end , mr president .
clearly , the creation of an area of freedom and security is everyone 's joint task .
in the future , it will certainly be necessary to do this .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the commission has done a good job in this respect .
what they were up to there is not clear .
what i am saying is that we agree with the house on the need for action .
the debate is closed .
this is precisely what i wish to talk about .
in fact , it is not .
mr president , in my opinion the council has given way to parliament on a number of issues .
mr president , the european parliament can be quite content .
what course of action is open to us as things stand now ?
i would say that since the council has adopted a good many of parliament 's amendments , we should finally bring this process to a close .
the debate is closed .
this is what we are discussing here today , mr president .
we should open up negotiations with them .
we will not stand for it .
why is that ?
i hope that they will also have the support of the house .
mr president , there is really no need to go through all this again .
that would be completely unacceptable for us .
is this what we can expect to see in future ?
and where will we be then ?
i shall tell you another thing .
there is no call for it .
on the majority of these points , we agree with the committee on the environment 's proposals .
it is a question of principle .
but unfortunately it took quite considerable time for anything to be done on that .
i think we have to continue to do so .
the debate is closed .
i believe that it is essential .
it does not need to be .
what are they doing ?
so they see themselves as having no future .
so , i have five questions to put to you , commissioner .
secondly , that the funding that i have mentioned should and could be used for that purpose ?
we now need to focus on how we can bring help to those people .
like you , however , i am aware that all of this taken together is not enough .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
as has often been said , employment is our first priority .
that , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , is our first priority for the european council .
one principle is essential for the commission .
we cannot play around with health !
thank you mr president of the commission .
on that note i will close . thank you for your attention .
the answer has to be no .
of course not !
we hope a solution will be found to them .
without success , unfortunately .
i hope the european council will take this resolution seriously .
the second concern is the role of the european parliament .
and the third concern is european society and unemployment .
they do not , therefore , promote employment .
we propose a different approach .
and what is europe doing ?
let me make a second comment .
we want our citizens to play more of a part .
we want more democracy .
a lot is said about this vital need , but little is done .
i shall deal with only four of them .
i support the present motion for a resolution .
this also goes for the president of the commission .
i agree with this .
we must show that we really can use the union to deal with the problems which concern the public .
but if it is not successful , what future will there be for europe ?
why is that so ?
first , unemployment and jobs .
we must therefore concern ourselves in the first place with the problem of unemployment and jobs .
our citizens want more europe not less europe in the areas of foreign policy and security .
citizens no longer understand .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place in a moment .
madam president , just a second to reply to that statement .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we take note of these .
there is then a proposal to add the word ' government ' .
that means member states and we do not ask that from governments .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i think it is important to be clear on this before we begin negotiations with the council .
this must be quite clear .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
welcome
let us act !
secondly , what we need now is a political europe !
intergovernmental conference
there are two proposals in this report which we do not agree with even though we voted for the report as a whole .
why was this ?
and so ?
it is unacceptable that this ban is still not in force six months after it was due to be implemented .
but what has the european commission decided ?
for a reform of that importance , is this really responsible ?
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
of course , we can now say that there is peace and not war , which was not the case some months ago .
however , i should like to draw the house 's attention to a number of points which i believe to be very important .
the eu is still responsible for more than its fair share .
i hope we can do something in that respect in the future .
we must also ensure that there is effective coordination of the international aid effort .
this is the european union 's great responsibility , and indeed our responsibility .
and what happened ?
but what should be done now ?
commissioner , it is high time you took on full responsibility for this matter !
however , as we know , this is something that cannot be achieved quite so quickly .
the matter must be discussed .
i hope that we shall all be in a position to do so .
freedom of movement has not been established .
yet the people of the country want peace !
so , of course , it is not real peace .
it is important here that our committee on budgets and committee on budgetary control should play a major part .
today we have yet another financial regulation .
this makes positive results all the more important .
to achieve them money is needed ; the aid conference was successful but more is needed .
is there anything for people to vote on ?
in that respect the elections are important .
so what really is the problem ?
so what , in my opinion , needs to be done ?
we must see these elections as a beginning , not as giving up ; elections must be held to increase solidarity .
we can do this .
they must have a future to go back to .
the member states of the european union and the european commission are doing what they can to help with these efforts .
madam president , just a few more words on the specific contribution of the commission through the community budget .
and we shall do so , but we cannot take that responsibility upon ourselves .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the council could not take a decision at the time it was needed .
what are these amendments about ?
why will the council not even discuss it ?
madam president , my report is short and i hope to the point .
in this regard i would like to put a question to the commissioner .
why has this money still not been made available ?
what is the sense of such a procedure ?
perhaps you accept only six of these proposals , but then at least allow us to talk about these six , or five , or ten , or however many you like .
this is entirely due to the fact that the new regulation has not come into force .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
i think the presidency would agree that we have made much progress towards a common system .
they understand the system .
they know what they are voting for .
but that is not the issue here .
but that is not the issue .
why do you not do this ?
that is the view of the presidency of the council .
i should like to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
therefore , i share the president-in-office 's views on these matters .
the council can only agree with the need raised by the honourable member and hope to receive proposals from the commission .
i agree with the points that have been made .
however , in connection with kosovo i should like to make one comment .
do you not think that this would be a good opportunity ?
i agree with you , i think you are right .
mr president , that is wrong .
now we must move on to the next question .
we hope things will improve in the future .
i , too , wish to thank the president-in-office .
i just wish the house to know that i will remain here for this particular purpose .
i will stop the questions now .
i do not doubt for a second that the commission will be able to take the initiative in this area .
because that is what we all want .
as i see it , it is no freedom at all .
the council and the commission should now draw up a programme as soon as possible for the initiatives required to implement the decisions made at the summit .
the joint debate is closed .
' .
the four amendments that have been tabled are all , i think , very important .
i share the concerns of the committee on budgets and budgetary control .
it is a problem of time .
the debate is closed .
therefore there is a need for a european directive .
the commission is prepared to accept the majority of the proposed amendments , in total or in part .
the commission cannot accept amendment no 10 .
thank you for your attention .
we look forward to taking this very important subject further .
the debate is closed .
this has however not been implemented .
madam president , the opinion of the committee on the environment is not very different from that of the committee on social affairs and employment .
i want the report to be a success .
after all , there are already countries which have in fact decided to implement it .
i would therefore ask the commission to step up the work in the scientific committee .
i am pleased to say that the majority of the amendments proposed are acceptable to the commission .
however , in the case of these sectors it is simply not possible .
for that reason the commission cannot accept them .
the commission can understand the basis for amendments nos 3 and 4 .
that is a key point and many of you will understand this , in particular the rapporteur .
madam president , perhaps a few comments would be in order .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i have made a note of what you have said .
and i have now made due note of your comment .
are there any other comments ?
this will be of great value to me in my future work .
madam president and members of the european parliament , thank you for your attention .
i now wish to comment more on his report .
about what ?
i shall now turn to the amendments , the budget and the question of the office in brussels .
we can support amendments nos 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 .
my group has tabled an amendment to that effect , and i hope honourable members will support it .
the debate is closed .
that is not possible !
why not ?
first among these is public information .
this is a most important subject .
the subject is far too important .
the problem is a very serious one .
the commission has presented a good communication .
but that is not the issue here .
mr president , i will take less than two minutes .
there is one internal consideration regarding the commission .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i ask you to put that to the vote .
( parliament agreed to the proposal )
this is something that absolutely must be put right in the future .
workers should be given the best possible protection .
i naturally support the amendments relating to these requirements .
this country is a member of the council of europe .
we too found it difficult to achieve our democratic standards .
but there is no doubt that great progress has been made .
the joint debate is closed .
we must thus do all we can to improve the conditions in which those elections are held .
the debate is closed .
we cannot use words alone .
it is time to say enough is enough .
it is time to act instead of just talking .
is there anything new ?
we shall come here as often as is necessary .
we have a particular responsibility for that conflict .
that has to be taken into account .
here it is up to the commission to act .
how much longer do we have to go on talking about it ?
do we want to do this ?
do we want to take that kind of action ?
there were resolutions and discussions .
the question is , what can we do about it ?
we therefore make two proposals in the resolution .
human rights in turkey , of course .
without justice there is no democracy .
mr president , the human rights situation is and remains a matter for concern .
we should not do that . it is not a serious way of doing things .
one can only welcome that fact .
what did they tell us ?
what did she mean by that , mr president ?
human rights are another matter .
the joint debate is closed .
that at least is something .
i ask all members to support this resolution .
in fact , if i had my way , he would not even have been allowed in parliament .
the joint debate is closed .
at every significant stage in this war the european parliament has approved a resolution with specific proposals .
we really do face a fundamental political problem here .
there are two things which need to be said .
let me follow this up with a few other questions .
we called for that too in may this year !
that time is now past .
the joint debate is closed .
mr president , i am against this amendment .
we cannot accept this amendment in its present form .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we are giving our position as parliament .
i believe it is important to establish that .
to return to the content of the resolution .
yet the reality is very different .
the system should work on two levels .
the debate is closed .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this proposal from the commission comes in the framework of the growth of the information society .
allow me to turn now to some of the committee on culture 's most important amendments .
that is to say , we are concerned today not with cultural but with economic measures .
we must support them in this , at union level too .
in this respect the programme is a step in the right direction .
this is my proposal to the commission .
for legal reasons the commission cannot support the european parliament 's proposal .
mr president , i put two very specific questions to the commission .
it is something that we cannot accept .
that must after all be our objective .
i believe we entirely agree on that objective , even if we have different views on the legal basis .
my answer may have been too general .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
because that is not clear at the moment .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
but since the main points are to be found in the other two regulations , the committee on agriculture decided to give its position on them too .
as rapporteur i welcome that proposal .
those are the main points of my report .
we agree with his comments .
mr president , first i would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
why are we having this debate today ?
why is that ?
let us be clear about this .
and , if i may , i should like to make a few comments on the amendments that have been tabled .
this is the purpose of the amendment tabled by our rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
and the european union has an interest in having free access to third country markets .
is the commission prepared to look at this and make funds available ?
what is important to us is that the conditions of competition should be the same .
the debate is closed .
after all , this does not happen with other sectors of the economy , such as industry and services .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
other questions have created a difficult situation .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
you will be speaking about the agenda in a moment and i have major problems with the agenda .
urgent political matters
thank you very much , mr president of the commission .
mr president , mr president of the commission , i have two questions .
the first concerns the fight against terrorism .
that is no way to create jobs .
and i believe that you too , once and for all , should respect this commitment .
( applause )
i believe we have a certain responsibility in that respect .
mr president , i share the view of the honourable member .
there will still be a need to provide public aid to development , at least for the least developed countries .
we can help them not only with aid but also by making it possible for them to trade their products in our markets .
mr president , i would like to continue on the subject of unemployment .
if this was discussed , what conclusions did you come to ?
you said something i simply do not understand .
welcome
i have already had an opportunity to share with you my assessment of the justice and home affairs issue .
thank you , mr president-in-office .
i was particularly pleased by the fact that it was the commission 's proposals that made it possible to reach an agreement .
the framework is now in place .
one step at a time , we shall get there .
all this costs money .
to each his role , to each his responsibility .
that is what the european council did , and i welcome it .
we are , then , on the right road .
over two years of discussions in summit we have seen very little real action on employment .
there was a total lack of action with regard to employment .
we know now that is not to happen , it is not to be .
( applause )
( applause )
what kind of society do we want ?
the proposed enlargement of the union makes this approach essential .
why ?
the commission should work on that !
we are talking about a period of years .
in any case , no crisis .
there we must think above all of the plan for employment .
we hope so !
the second great problem is employment .
that is precisely what i asked .
that is the point !
so let us talk about this .
i must say that in this parliament it is always better when there is no agreement between the governments on such important questions .
until we have a debate like that we are not going to get very far .
so why is there no progress on this issue of employment ?
these are the serious issues !
this is what europe is not doing .
the intergovernmental conference will therefore have to come to a decision on this subject .
but , mr president , what is that risk ?
as far as employment is concerned , much remains to be done , and i believe there are at least three areas in which greater efforts must be made .
so it is up to the individual national states to decide on measures , as you , mr president-in-office , also asked them to do .
we are not .
i think that is also part of any real assessment .
that can be discussed .
now for employment .
i think we are all agreed about that .
what is the reason ?
that does not mean that we cannot make an important contribution .
we must keep that in view - and that is also the objective of the european people 's party .
i would like to stress two of them .
it is more than that .
as for you , your word was ' solidarity ' .
no , i am wrong , not solidarity , ' responsibility ' .
but there is much work to be done .
they will look at unemployment - and i know everyone has been talking about it .
was there any progress made ?
i do not think there was .
we need now to see some action .
i want to look simply at budgetary matters .
my concern also is that the council only says it will consider these proposals .
what does that mean ?
firstly because of the growth in air transport and secondly because of the development of the information society .
everything possible was done .
i ask myself why this is not yet the case .
since then little progress has been made .
when will the commission put forward this proposal ?
however , she did not give her position on the main question .
that is not the purpose of these three new countries .
i would like you to tell me how things are to go on if no agreement can be reached ?
but madam commissioner , you did not answer the questions raised .
that is really the only answer we want .
but we would like to know what this something is .
but i feel that this really is essential .
that is what i am working for , and i also believe that it is possible .
i understand that i have the support of parliament . that is the task before us , and together we must do all we can to ensure that it is achieved .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
as rapporteur of the committee responsible , i want to discuss six points .
this is not the case .
but what cost ?
this is as true for food policy as it is for environment policy .
we are speaking of rules , madam president , that is of legislative provisions .
either they are the law or they are nothing .
that is clear , madam president .
that is unacceptable .
i would like to add two comments .
the intergovernmental conference will have to concern itself with that .
that will naturally be done .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
how true , how right they both are !
so , let us work out the strategy and carry it through .
it now has an opportunity to make up for that .
what is our strategy ?
how do we really propose to promote this technology ?
commissioner , it must therefore be decided what the union should do and what the member states should do .
i congratulate him for three things .
we do not even use the money that is available in the european union as well as we could .
does it matter ?
we say that our no 1 priority is the creation of jobs .
so , what do we have to do ?
we should follow up progress on that action plan at least every six months .
the european union has a budget it could use .
i should like to add two things .
first that at all times we have been aware that the commission supported us , of course , much more than most member states and the council itself .
but that is not the case here .
europe can do something with that .
for those the budget is even increased without any discussion .
we should regard this as an urgent priority .
i should also like to agree with my colleagues who say we must have a real energy policy for the european union .
it is about time we had a proper energy policy for the european union and a proper environment policy .
why ?
i regard this report as particularly important , for very many reasons .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
may i , in conclusion , bring something to the commissioner 's attention in this respect .
now let me stress one particular point .
the need for access to education and information is now essential , and i would say , even urgent .
the debate is closed .
i am of course in agreement with what all my colleagues have just said , the more so since it was i who tabled the first motion for a resolution .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
there is a very practical step .
we have to find out from the commission why this is .
i welcome the commission 's report .
how do we right this wrong ?
what are the results ?
there are proposals .
yet , a number of comments concerning the problem should be made :
with those comments , i ask parliament to support my report .
secondly , a great number of small companies are established , but a fair number also go under .
thank you , mr president .
that is not the case .
mr president , this is an extremely important issue .
one has to ask whether or not the commission is really serious .
that is due particularly to the short period for application .
if others have to pay on time , he will have to as well .
the question is what can the european union do to help us .
no new money is needed .
look at our case once again .
the question is whether we can put this right with a directive .
we are always talking about the creation of sustainable employment .
we should have that directive and have it now .
we have to focus on them .
it is time for action .
governments , public institutions and the commission should lead the way by example .
i welcome this directive .
i am pleased about this .
that is my proposal , commissioner .
this will certainly be a very difficult procedure .
the debate is closed .
we need a strong political will to protect the public .
action must be taken to stop it .
to do so we must put an end to the civil and military use of nuclear energy .
not even that .
in our opinion the environmental guarantee shall apply as soon as it is referred to by the national parliament of a member state for a decision to be made .
who can accept it ?
the subject is a crucial one .
it is the guarantee of the future for one part of the world .
statement by the president
madam president , on a point of order .
madam president , on a point of order . i just wish to say that i have had the same experience .
we shall have to see what can be done .
madam president , on a point of order .
the citizens of that state do not have equal rights .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
that is why i think we have to decide to vote on the text this week .
( applause )
last week it was not so clear as far as the group of the european people 's party is concerned .
( parliament agreed to the request )
but i do think that we should do all we can and should call upon the council to make this matter a special priority .
as we do not know its reasons , my group will vote against the request .
( parliament decided to keep the report on the agenda )
welcome
( applause )
madam president , before i begin i should like to say that i come here as the rapporteur on this report at second reading .
we feel further work should be done in that area .
people must come first !
what has happened to those people ?
i feel that these are entirely relevant concerns , and the commission is trying as far as possible to meet them .
the commission is thus giving priority to activities which are in progress in this area .
the debate is closed .
that is one question .
we do not know whether this is true .
what we need is time .
we have time to get this directive right because it does not have to be implemented until 1998 .
the debate is closed .
these amendments should therefore be agreed to as they stand .
that is why it is not difficult for us to support this joint position given that it is full of common sense and good reason .
i think it would be good for us to discuss this .
we hope that these rules will continue to apply in the future .
i am pleased to be able to say that we are also in agreement at second reading .
the debate is closed .
so what happened with the council ?
there was no discussion .
mr president , i should like to congratulate the commission .
now , the are group has discussed this report and reached the following conclusions .
the conditions of competition must be fair .
i call on the commission to support these views .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to say first of all that the common position of the council is clearly better than the commission proposal .
mr president , i am pleased that you made your last comment .
i hope you will look into this , mr president , and let us know what you decide .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
madam president , i have a question concerning yesterday 's order of business which was approved when the agenda was finally adopted .
are there any other comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
madam president , on behalf of the committee on agriculture , i would ask all colleagues to vote in favour of this urgent procedure .
there is not .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the old european community treaty already included provisions for the creation of a common internal market in europe .
that is made quite clear in the text and therefore there should be no concerns for member states .
madam president , like other members i welcome the commission 's three proposals to make a reality out of free movement .
the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights has two concerns .
there is a need for all citizens to be made aware of these effective measures .
so why has this right not yet been implemented ?
in my view , this is something that we cannot accept .
but we are a long way from that .
that has not happened .
but this did not happen .
so what we are talking about here is the move from a financial union to a citizens ' union .
but there is a political connection between the two issues , and it is up to the national governments to take the necessary measures as quickly as possible .
those are the only priorities - or if people are a priority , it is only some people , not all of them .
however , that cannot be our position , nor should it be the position of the commission .
but freedom and security go hand in hand .
i wish to know why this should be ?
secondly , it also means the end for freedom of movement as a community issue .
certainly not , in my view .
this does not mean to say that i cannot understand the concerns which have been expressed by the home affairs ministers .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
you know my position , and that of the commission .
what is the situation , therefore ?
that much is clear , i believe .
and that is what the commission is doing .
as for the commission , it is doing its job .
the second question is what the commission should do next .
what role should the commission play here ?
there must also be fair competition with other measures .
if legislation was necessary , it was during this period .
i am coming to an end , mr president .
that has not been and is not the case .
so what can we say ?
mr president , mr president of the commission , firstly , i should like to say that we welcome this morning 's statement .
furthermore , a number of measures were taken by the previous commission in this respect .
it is in parliament 's resolution , not in an internal commission document , that these words are to be found .
let us turn now to the document in question .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
under that rule , i can make such a request before the final vote .
we cannot allow that .
i would ask you to support my motion .
this is no way for us to deal with one another !
what should parliament do ?
( parliament decided to refer the reports back to committee )
the reduction of social protection will lead to a reduction of protection , full stop .
so let us not hear from the commission tomorrow that they did not know .
this is not our policy , and it is not my idea of employment .
they are right to be concerned and we must ensure their concerns are heard .
we have an agreement that we can live with .
is that what they mean by compromise ?
however , for reasons of political principle i shall vote against the report .
this has come to nothing , however .
i should also like to mention employment .
there has been a great deal of talk about responsibility .
we hope of course that there will be many who do the same , because the environment is the future , whether we like it or not .
i would like to hear what the commissioner has to say about this .
i think it is important to have an answer from you on this .
whether or not we have been successful is a matter for debate , as we have already heard from several colleagues .
as a first step , it is vital that these guidelines are approved .
everything has its price .
i should like to set out the four reasons why , in my view , we need this agreement .
i wish you every success in your work !
it is an extremely difficult position .
nevertheless , our work on this project will not end with tomorrow 's vote .
this is a measure which should set an example to all the member states of the european union .
they will not provide the resources !
however , let us move on from the institutional questions .
mr president , there are four comments that i should like to make .
mr president , i have two comments .
firstly , there is the institutional side .
on the other hand , that is how things are : this is a compromise , and i shall naturally vote in favour of it .
that was my first point .
we should take the decisions together - council , commission and parliament .
from the point of view of regional policy , this is a success .
i would like to welcome all of that .
but i would , in so doing , like to thank the commissioner for his positive contribution to this very issue .
i wish you every success in your work !
this is certainly not what people want .
the debate is closed .
the report by the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights makes an important contribution to the debate on this issue , and parliament should adopt it by a large majority .
to my mind , this applies just as much to the field which concerns us here as to the more general one of human rights .
i should like to thank him for his work .
people must have the right to be different .
that question must be put to the council .
no such decision has as yet been taken .
what form will the action programme take ?
subject : wto
thank you for your answer , commissioner .
the commission will , in due course , put forward its views .
there are still too few of them .
at the beginning of last year , there was only one - now there are three .
this issue is an old one , however .
to my mind , that is a central issue .
we are prepared to help it in this matter .
the matter is currently under discussion .
i thank the commissioner for her answer .
i too want to thank the commissioner for the work that she has done in this area .
i can only express my thanks for the support for our position .
we shall continue with our efforts in this respect .
what is going on ?
madam commissioner , thank you very much for your reply but we should look here at three political points .
the aim of community structural policy is to promote sustainable regional development .
i would like to thank the commissioner for her answer .
i am not really used to that but i consider it a good thing in this context .
subject : future of the structural funds
unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the political aspect of the peace process .
i wish to thank the commissioner for a very full response on this particular fund .
what action could be taken ?
i should like to thank the commissioner for her positive answer to my question .
what form will this support take ?
mr president , i should like to thank the commissioner for her reply .
i must therefore have a clear answer : is there new support ?
both these views are wrong .
let me give you an example from the past .
we have tabled amendments with three basic objectives .
the people of europe must be allowed to have their say on matters of such importance .
it is also good that the european parliament is taking up a position on this matter .
that being so , common standards must be created .
unfortunately not .
the answer is no .
i would add that the intergovernmental conference may also cause some changes to be made to the treaty .
this has been their practice for several years , particularly where scientific research is concerned .
the debate is closed .
things will be open and public .
but that is not the main point .
there are three comments i should like to make here .
such is the matter under discussion .
this is not good .
this is still the case for members from my own country .
the proposal does not go far enough , however .
my conclusion is thus that we have two proposals which are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough .
why will they not go along with this ?
the joint debate is closed .
yet this is what may well happen .
many good things have been said about the future .
all in all , international trade agreements are crucial for us .
the debate is closed .
we are really much better off here .
these guidelines provide for projects of common interest .
we cannot , however , agree to this .
allow me to mention some other aspects which are important in this connection .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
i thank you .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
( applause )
we will continue work on the action programme on immigration and asylum .
the environment is therefore an area of particular concern to our presidency .
economic and monetary union is on course .
the european union must make its contribution towards that end .
i come now to the intergovernmental conference .
the european parliament is a parliament for people throughout the european union , for the people of all the member states .
they are the focus for a community of member states .
i have set out for you our priorities for the next six months .
)
thank you .
thank you , mr president-in-office .
ladies and gentlemen , we come now to the debate .
however , the president-in-office has made a very good start .
i take this opportunity , on behalf of my group , to congratulate and offer support to the president-in-office and to wish him every success in the course of the presidency .
intergovernmental cooperation on these is simply not working . take drugs , for example .
a dialogue , in particular , on the social model and problem of unemployment .
in our opinion , this is now , above all , a problem of public health .
that is indeed the position .
( applause )
now is the time for this to happen .
first , the past .
i wish ireland success .
our citizens expect action , not programmes or reports .
i would give the same answer .
i am very concerned at the way things are going .
mr president , i wish your presidency well .
we have every confidence that it will be a successful one .
i also wish to ask the president-in-office to deal with the nuclear issue .
there are common policies to encourage our development .
in other words , we know the kind of difficulties you have .
madam president , i would like to deal with two issues very quickly in the time that i have .
we want something done about unemployment .
however , the conditions must be right .
another subject , mr president-in-office , is turkey .
we have heard very little about turkey today .
why cannot we as the european union take an initiative ?
( applause from the left )
so there will be no court cases for the time being .
madam president , on a point of order .
are they not concerned ?
the debate is closed
welcome
i welcome you on behalf of parliament .
( applause )
we do not think so .
mr president-in-office , thank you .
the next item is voting time .
( parliament approved the joint text )
mr president , thank you for giving me the floor on a point of order .
i wanted to make that point to honourable members before the vote .
all members have the opportunity to use their vote to express their views on the issue we have to decide here .
i hope parliament will do so .
that is not a point of order !
after the vote :
before the vote on amendment no 10 :
after the vote on amendment no 10 :
( parliament adopted the decision )
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , it is simply out of a sense of responsibility that i am voting for the common project .
this is a completely unacceptable practice .
this proposal will not create these necessary jobs .
the commission was certainly in no doubt about that .
as i said yesterday , saying that and saying nothing comes to the same thing .
and for the future of democracy !
and that 's that !
let 's be clear about that !
so , this is a first step .
this is a first step , an agreement that was difficult to reach .
this should also be the rule for members of the european parliament .
measures must be taken .
parliament has just taken its first step .
all such a committee can achieve is further public debate .
and today , what has been done ?
i quite understand , madam president , but last year the practice was different .
madam president , one thing you said was very important .
amendments can be tabled .
i was very pleased to hear that .
now at least they are sitting down and talking to one another .
one might well call that progress in terms of security policy .
the report says that very clearly .
mr president , the actions of the eu member states and the european union are of course crucial to security in europe .
common defence is discussed .
this is the only way that cooperation with the countries concerned can be achieved .
however , have we made any progress in this field and , if so , what have we achieved ?
that role was left more or less to the united states .
i consider it wrong to want to make the union into a nuclear power .
what effect would such enlargement have on those states which remain outside ?
at the moment we have 15 national foreign policies .
it is time for a security policy based on negotiations and not on force .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this report is a good report .
you have all heard this , you heard it just now .
the european commission at any rate will continue to play its part .
that is a very important point .
no , we do not .
the debate is closed .
i will return to this point .
i now propose to turn to some of the areas where concern has been expressed by parliament in relation to the guidelines .
employment is our joint concern and is , of course , the concern of the citizens of the european community .
that is why the council could not take it up in the guidelines .
it is also a fact that certain measures will take some time to show positive results .
i now turn to another subject .
large and small companies should be working together .
the objective is common growth of the european economy , growth of the community itself .
the president-in-office of the council mentioned four areas - monetary , budgetary , labour markets and structural reform .
what europe needs is confidence - not just market confidence but consumer confidence , too , and the way to consumer confidence is through a future without unemployment .
finally , there must be solidarity between those who are in work and those who are out of it .
in fact , these two are the same priority .
the european union can do some things .
consumers were able to get better value .
the same is true of the single currency .
the single currency will be another step .
few people today can have any doubt about that .
the debate is closed .
in some cases the children are never found .
they concern our children 's future .
however , as the honourable minister said , there is nothing to prevent the presidency taking an initiative on this .
however , as i said , it is important that the council should take an initiative on this .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
question time ( council )
subject : peace policy
i thank the president-in-office for his reply .
that has been very crucial over the past few days .
the opportunity is there for them .
would he not agree with me on that ?
unfortunately the council has not yet been able to adopt a common position on this proposal .
if so , what has brought about this change ?
i thank the president-in-office for his answer .
it is not the first time this has happened .
recently it has happened several times .
there has been no change in the agreement .
i hope the minister would agree with that .
i note what the honourable member has said in his contribution .
i note that there are concerns .
as i have just said , the council has not received a commission proposal and if we do the council will certainly act on such a proposal .
i thank the president-in-office for his response .
each member state is trying to deal with the problem as best it can .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
the employment of young people is particularly important .
we have had much talk but we have had no great success to date .
mr president , thank you very much , mr president-in-office of the council , for your kind words .
can i say in general terms , that we are all very concerned about employment , but the reality is that we do not do what we should do .
but i think that this question has now become a fundamental one .
i have been very clear on what i have said .
further to this i have two other questions .
that , as i understand it , is the situation .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
can you do that ?
we have economic interests .
so some progress has been made in that regard .
i believe that it is important that children should be given independent rights .
the question of appropriate legal instruments to protect children is now being seen as fundamental to the development of our society .
movement on the brussels convention is important , as has been said .
but now we want to see some results at last .
as far as the people involved are concerned , they need help , and they need it now .
she clearly did not get the points i made earlier on .
i have no doubt it is one of the issues that will be raised .
i will draw her full attention to this debate .
they did say earlier that they could not do that .
i would ask all those who agreed at the time to review their decision again , and to think about the reasons for their agreement .
the debate is closed .
as far as the part which i deal with is concerned , in other words the other institutions , i should like to say a few words .
i want to talk to the general budget rather than parliament 's budget .
however , that is still more than 10 % of the present year 's budget .
now it is not parliament that is responsible for this fact .
but the european parliament cannot accept this approach , for various reasons .
and this applies to all the other member states as well .
yet this cannot be the purpose of our work .
if problems remain we must come back to this in future budgets .
the debate is closed .
we should thank him .
this report will be voted on tomorrow .
i am sure it will be successful .
of course , i cannot accept this situation .
this is obviously the wrong way to do things and obviously i cannot accept it .
this i find unacceptable !
this is something which has to be said !
but there is nothing about this .
is this true ?
in the case of a general reduction , however , such as the one being considered by the council , this is no longer possible .
the debate is closed .
this has not happened .
it is not available .
those are our proposals , and with them in mind we support this report .
we are dealing with an important subject here .
it is quite right that the rapporteur comments on this .
it is not just a question of this report . i have had a few reports myself .
the debate is closed .
i just wish to make the following points in support of the policy .
in social and environmental terms we get good value out of this policy .
we cannot support that .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
his decision shall be final ' .
i should like parliament to decide on this request for an amendment to the minutes .
mr president , you have made reference to the rights of the president of a sitting .
there was no problem about that .
it was accepted .
ladies and gentlemen , i understand very well the importance of the discussion we are having here , but i should now like to close the vote on the minutes .
i stand by your decision , and we should support it .
this is my proposal , which i think can be taken as a decision .
mr president , i shall say nothing about what has just been said .
i shall simply express an opinion about the proposal you have just made .
you approved the vote yesterday .
we all did and we must stand by that .
the result is your doing .
mr president , for myself , i simply want the minutes to be clear for people outside .
this is the whole point !
i can keep it short , mr president .
that is a fundamental point .
he needs total support .
i support this report but i believe that further discussions should take place .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
do you have any proposal to make ?
( parliament decided to refer the matter back to the committee responsible )
i consider that to be very important .
that is what we have voted for .
mr president , i think it would be quite all right to start the debate now .
there are three strong reasons for this proposal .
i therefore put them to the vote now .
( parliament approved the minutes of the previous sitting )
' .
far from it !
but would no agricultural policy at all be any better ?
we do not think so .
we do not know .
put simply , even if we can do something , should we ?
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the fundamental question we must ask ourselves is : what kind of europe have we in mind for the future ?
today 's vote was a step in that direction .
this was crucial if we were to vote for the report as a whole .
we do not believe that a successful common foreign and security policy requires a common defence policy , let alone a common defence , in order to be successful .
children are the citizens of our present and future society .
we should also ensure that cooperation agreements are established with third countries in this area .
you have the floor .
on a point of procedure first , mr president .
i fully understand , mr president .
the joint debate is closed .
nothing !
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
but the council and commission have done nothing , absolutely nothing .
i cannot see how we could say no to this .
we believe that this process should be supported by the european union .
we cannot accept this situation .
there was then certainly no democracy but there was nevertheless a certain sense of hope .
when is that report going to be made available , if it is indeed being prepared ?
the joint debate is closed .
the aim of this proposal is to go further .
anything but !
i would like to add something , however .
so we have to use any opportunity we can get to put out an opinion of the european parliament .
i really do not know .
i do not understand the commissioner 's reply very well .
the joint debate is closed .
i think not .
madam president , my colleague is quite right .
what a democracy !
there is not much hope left for a democratic development .
will it continue to look on ?
madam president , i have just one request , namely that the commissioner answer my questions .
the debate is closed .
we will now take the vote .
it is high time the decisions were implemented .
it will be good for all of us .
the debate is closed .
but not only that .
finally , mr president , there have been five amendments to the report .
i should like to make three points in relation to this , mr president .
so let us take a good look at the present situation .
this is essential to the future of the union .
the committee is much more open than it used to be .
most of our work is open to the public .
not enough is done there and it is important .
my last point is that our main problem is with the member states .
we do not get cooperation from the member states .
but citizens also need to be clear about the role of this committee .
you have also heard an excellent account from the commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the agreement is in the interests of european research policy ; i would like to stress that here .
and that is also what we expect from our partners , indeed in every area .
certainly not !
this may create more jobs .
but i have a number of questions to the commissioner .
it is also good that the conclusions mention how important it is that this should be seen as support for the peace process .
on the other hand , i am concerned about some of the content of the agreement .
we no more want such research to be carried out as a result of agreements with countries outside the eu than we want it to be carried out within the eu .
mr president , i am very much in favour of eu research cooperation .
however , in respect of this report i have two concerns .
i am very much in favour of the peace process .
firstly , this agreement is of benefit to both parties .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
i wanted to say something about yesterday 's minutes .
if so , does that mean that the commission will not provide the additional funding to deal with the problem throughout the european union ?
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i wish to thank the commission for coming forward with its proposal this year in good time .
i would ask the house to accept this proposal and , indeed , to accept that amendment as well .
why this proposal ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we do not agree with this report and with the direction proposed by the commission .
that was the aim of the commission 's policy , or at least that is what it said at the time .
i hope that it will do so !
i would ask that we vote for this now .
i would also like to thank the european parliament for giving priority to this commission proposal .
and therefore i should like to ask you once again , before we vote , whether you will now accept this amendment .
however , what we cannot do at this time is to adopt that amendment .
for that reason , the commission cannot accept this amendment now .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
which means the debate would start all over again .
on this point , i do not understand you .
many of my colleagues here present are members of the committee on agriculture .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that is what happened in this case .
however , i do not think that this type of support is the right way of going about it .
consumers are prepared to pay for that .
this is the wrong direction , and it has nothing to do with quality .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
but this is not a point of order and this is not the time to open that debate .
is that in order ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
we will not start up a discussion on this !
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
urgent political matters
we are , in a sense , working with them .
thank you for your kind words .
that is absolutely crucial .
but why only now ?
how does the commission view that ?
let us be strong .
the best way of being strong is by being united .
what is the commission doing in this regard ?
i very much agree with that .
but i actually believe that taking this action is in the best interests not only of the european union but of the united states as well .
i should like to thank the commissioner for his statement and congratulate him on the measures which he has taken .
the pressure put on now is absolutely vital for the final result we wish to achieve .
what is your position on this ?
it is unacceptable to say that here is something the wto cannot even consider .
but that is quite unacceptable and not a position we could go along with at all .
i share that view .
they are an example to us today .
the commissioner has already said as much .
we need to answer a number of questions .
how long will this take ?
of course one has to put one 's own house in order .
mr president , we would like it not to be true .
what must be done at national level ?
not least we in europe are the focus of attention .
as members of the european parliament , of course , we have work to do .
it should not be too difficult to reach an overall agreement on this .
the debate is closed .
public services
the next item is the statement by the commission on public services .
today , this is no longer the case in a good many sectors .
in any case , that sector is not within our area of responsibility .
today , this is no longer the case .
i say again : the debate remains open .
first of all , mr president , i welcome what the commissioner has said .
i think it is what we wanted to hear .
our group agreed to a treaty amendment , precisely in order to make a rather more positive point on the question of public services .
they are three in number .
and what does the commission do ?
why we still have a debate , without a document and without a basic text ?
but we all know what that is already .
we asked for it because we believe that we are able to think for ourselves about what we want from public services within the european union .
but i hope things will improve this time .
today , something is being said , and above all more and more should be said .
we are not against the market , or against competition .
what we are against is a europe which would have only a single aim : a single market based on competition alone .
europe must have other objectives too .
in those cases , obviously , reforms are needed .
the union , and especially the community , must have a policy based both on competition and on the public interest .
what are they ?
mr president , public services exist for the public .
as long as you agree with that , we shall agree with you .
so are we .
mr president , i too welcome the opportunity to have this debate with the commissioner .
this would allow positive policy proposals on public service .
i do not know whether the commission will adopt that idea .
we shall see in due course what form this type of communication will take .
we are talking about the powers of the european union and of the commission , not about social security .
we will have many opportunities to discuss this again , because there are many problems .
that is the reality of the situation .
today , the consumer has a say in things .
that is the real situation .
and did people have access to that technology ?
that was the way things were .
but i am not in favour of competition at all costs , because one can have too much of a good thing .
( applause ) there are many areas in which a little more competition would be in the public interest .
in conclusion , i can say that i do share some of your concerns .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
it is actually 15 different national programmes .
structural funding does not allow that .
i know that action has taken place but that needs to be even better .
we move on to what i would call best practice .
unfortunately , that seems to be too often the case .
other rules were not referred to either in the report , such as respect for the principle of equal opportunities .
what is it doing to stop this ?
the matter is therefore extremely serious .
i believe that these are the questions which we must start to discuss .
in their present form the structural funds will in the end create no or only a few new jobs .
we will certainly have to consider this .
projects should meet the needs of citizens and of society in the future .
i think we also need to have access to the monitoring reports .
i have seen some .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this does not include resources from the cohesion fund or funding provided through other community initiatives .
if she can bring that about we should give her our total support .
what needs to be done ?
i should like to congratulate the rapporteur .
those responsible for small projects find the situation particularly difficult .
we need to improve information , and above all the transparency of such information .
we are talking about making the european union possible .
we have to deal with new development in a more positive way .
why do we say this ?
the debate is closed .
but we expect a little more in future .
let me refer to another area .
five : we have monitoring reports on the specific programmes .
thank you for your attention .
it is always best to start at home .
take this report .
the eu must do much , much better here in future .
first , this report was the first of its kind .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
my thanks to the rapporteur for the excellent text he has put to us .
once again we should not get carried away .
amendment no 1 and most of the changes proposed under amendment no 5 are therefore accepted .
the debate is closed .
that is true .
i think the commission has made good proposals .
perhaps the commissioner could say a few words on this .
this report is a contribution to that work .
this means amendment no 1 must be adopted .
in the view of my group they should all meet a high level of safety .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
local development and employment initiatives
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , unemployment is still a crucial problem in the european union .
there is therefore an urgent need for action .
the world of work today has many different aspects .
in this sense , the implementation of the commission 's initiative is an urgent demand , which we must make together .
i hope , commissioner , that we shall get more than just a communication .
you are very well aware that the european union can play a part here .
i will say just this : we have to do more .
it is clear that we need to take practical action , and achieve changes at local level .
local work for local people using local resources means , in the first place , services .
we can also see what the framework conditions are .
it is not enough just to create jobs .
we all know that economic growth is necessary but not sufficient .
all the special measures are therefore needed .
part of unemployment benefit should be used for this purpose .
more could be achieved than at present using these resources .
from our point of view , these local initiatives are , of course , of major importance for several reasons .
they are the result of investment and they are the result of investment by very many people .
the commission is aware that more has to be done .
the debate is closed .
was it the commission or was it an administrative decision ?
so we would like to know on what date that decision was taken .
the investment was high .
can anything now be done ?
the problem comes down to one of democracy .
who took specific decisions ?
naturally there are no minutes in that case .
i also understand quite well the first answer .
the debate is closed .
this possibility and the right of member states to make use of it must , i believe , continue to be available in the future .
i voted against this report for the following reasons :
what next !
but it does sometimes find majority support in this parliament .
a second comment is one which i think applies to all the reports on employment considered in this house .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
it is up to you to decide when the debate should be held .
firstly , there has already been a decision and a vote .
( applause )
i now put the request to the vote .
( parliament approved the request )
we hope that other groups will respect that .
it is also a question for the groups .
you decide what you wish to include in the resolution .
we should not let one issue get in the way of the other .
so , we are agreed on the procedure .
we should now bring this item to an end .
no , i shall not allow a debate on the matter now .
we have established the order of business .
the debate is closed .
human rights in the european union
that is what he is !
and these people are sitting here in the house voting on this report .
one has to ask who rules society .
but what has europe been doing ?
i have one final comment to make , namely that current economic policies in europe show no respect for economic rights , but i have already said as much a few minutes ago .
is this what you call free speech !
and why ?
that is the subject of the report we are discussing today .
precisely .
this must not happen .
the first is the right to education .
mr president , i know what human rights are .
i would particularly like to comment on two of the many good points in this report .
it is to review this whole issue again in the light of the progress made at the intergovernmental conference .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the house and the committee on transport had already approved this , but things cannot stop there .
however , there is one problem which i should like to ask the commission about , and i hope we shall be given a proper answer .
perhaps the commissioner would like to comment on that .
we therefore support this report .
the amendments proposed point in that direction .
what form will they take ?
will parliament be involved ?
that is all i can tell you from the information i have available .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thank you .
nevertheless , when this was fully discussed in committee , we had to accept the very strong legal view of the commission that this would not be possible .
i wish to look in particular at the commission proposal and a number of our amendments .
i therefore thank the rapporteur for it .
for this reason , my group will vote in favour of the report .
i thank the rapporteur for his report .
the debate is closed .
we take note of that .
madam president , on a point of order .
i am speaking from a budgetary point of view .
the funds in question will not be needed until 1998 .
that was decided quite clearly by the committee .
( parliament agreed to the proposal )
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
having said that , i should now like to go over the important points in the report .
all these things are true .
and , at the moment , we are not doing a great deal .
i think we are all aware that we are seriously behind the times .
discussions must then take place on individual cases in this respect .
secondly , there will be a great deal of movement on the labour market .
governments at local , national and european level must stop talking and lead by example .
as with so many issues in the european union we start very well .
we are in the same situation now with the information society .
are they going to support the budget line issues ?
we have no clear idea of what is going to happen or where we are going .
our institutional role requires that we do not allow that to happen .
i should like to hear what members of the commission think about this .
i am speaking here to the members of the commission , naturally , but also to my colleagues .
why ?
how ?
two years ago , only a few people wanted to speak on this subject .
the responsibility of the state must be different from in the past .
the state will have to take responsibility for regulation , and has already done so .
the information society is therefore not for everyone , but only for the few .
the commission cannot change that .
that is one problem .
for me , this really is a problem .
if i could only make that clear to you at last !
it is not enough just to speak - what you say needs to have some effect as well !
that is not enough !
perhaps the committee of the regions could take note of that !
this means that we need to create special rules . we must consider what is right and wrong in each individual case .
no answer .
that is all i am saying , and no more !
the public service was mentioned here again .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
firstly , why is it a key to our economic success ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i simply want to express my full agreement with the report presented to us .
there is no european model of public service , but there are common problems .
i hope that we shall have some further success .
for that , our amendments will have to be adopted .
and we shall be doing so again .
that does not help any of us to make progress .
what are the priorities for a public service in the european union ?
commissioner , do you know what market demand is today ?
certainly we do not .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we are indeed having a debate here .
if only that were so .
what are public services , in any case ?
i will return to that in a moment .
and i would add that , in many cases , it is also essential .
in this context , we have to decide what we wish to have .
there is of course , as there must be , a debate on public service .
first of all , this has nothing to do with the new services .
the debate is closed
the vote will take place in a moment .
madam president , my point of order concerns respect for the agenda .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the question is whether we get the necessary support .
we do not need them at european level too .
we vote in favour of this report , because we think its content is good .
unfortunately , there is still a need for it to do so .
the rule is that members have to be present .
i hope that you too , commissioner , will be able to support our amendments at european level .
the following are the points at issue here .
we have to put an end to this situation as soon as possible .
this is all well and good but it is not enough .
is it not high time to implement these proposals ?
it is our task to show women that the eu is doing something for them , and we can use this proposal to that effect .
i thank the house for its attention .
that is the only reason .
i would also go one step further .
what are we talking about here ?
the debate is closed .
so we want to see this adopted as quickly as possible .
the best way we can help that process is to adopt the common position without amendment this week .
but how do things look in the other sectors ?
unfortunately , when this subject is under discussion , they are not here !
but there is always a but .
the debate is closed .
what is at issue here ?
is this approach an effective one in terms of job creation ?
it is open to question .
is this possible ?
that is an issue we must face up to as well .
that is what we are dealing with here today .
but the reality is something different .
what we have before us is , so to speak , the best that could have come out of this situation .
now it is here .
that is what this debate is really all about .
that also applies when we are talking about employment .
and we wish that to continue to be the case .
there is another crucial point , i believe .
but what kind of work ?
the reduction in working time has therefore created 11 million jobs .
what are we doing now ?
let me show you why .
question time ( commission )
subject : the european parliament 's right of initiative
i should like to begin by dealing with the general point which you have raised again .
thank you very much for your reply , commissioner .
we have , as you so rightly said , the three areas .
something always has to happen first , and then everyone comes and says that the situation is particularly urgent .
there is no reason why it should not also apply to services .
thank you very much for that answer , commissioner .
why was it not available to the public ?
but if it were to happen , we should of course have to look into it .
that is the procedure .
aid for research and development is of course different .
the whole process is therefore important .
have i made myself clear enough now ?
that is the present position .
i believe that is important .
i hope that you agree with my decision .
we shall do that , and the council will decide .
that is the procedure .
that , however , is now a decision for the council .
the important thing is that we should have jobs in the first place .
that is why we need a clear set of rules .
we are in no doubt about the importance of this industry .
in other words , we have here a really important industry .
i know that we have the support of the house .
we have always said so .
thank you for the answer .
certainly , that is for different reasons .
proposals for action to reduce unemployment were put off .
there are two , the first being the state of the economy .
unemployment should be coming down .
what proposals does the commissioner have to bring down unemployment ?
i would add that in almost all cases , national measures are what is required .
we should not debate the wrong issues .
thank you , mr president , and thank you , commissioner , for the answer .
subject : environmental rules in the new member states
i should like to hear the commission 's views on the matter .
thank you for the answer , commissioner .
something must be done .
what is the eu doing ?
thank you for that very good answer .
i am also very pleased with the way in which this is to be done .
i have only one question , which goes a little further .
do you think that this is possible ?
it has simply taken too long for any proposals to go through .
that is what was done .
action on unemployment is needed at every level : at local , regional , national and european level .
we need growth , and we need increased demand .
but that reduction and that aim only makes sense if it is to create more jobs for those who are out of work .
this debate is not coming to an end today , but is only just beginning in this house .
firstly , there is a question of principle .
the third question is that of funding .
that is the question .
that does not help us either .
that is why our group cannot vote for it .
what action is needed ?
i cannot refer to them all for lack of time but i would like to refer to two of them .
we have just prepared the green paper on the information society , as i have said .
the debate is closed .
i hope that the council will change its mind and accept parliament 's proposal on this point .
finally , i should like to stress the results which have been achieved so far in terms of this proposal .
the debate is closed .
the commission therefore put forward a proposal for such a ban just over a year ago .
it all comes down to money .
this position , set out in amendments nos 1 and 2 , will be supported by my political group .
madam president , this problem has been going on for more than ten years now .
we have no amendments to move and can support the proposal , which is a step forward .
madam president , this is a very important report .
i very much hope that this will be the case .
i should like to say a few words on the amendments tabled by parliament at second reading .
the debate is closed .
madam president , everyone here is aware of the importance of this subject .
much as i value the work that the rapporteur has done , there is one point on which i do not share her opinion .
i congratulate the rapporteur on her work to this end , and i fully support her response to the text of the common position .
five years of discussions are already more than enough , i think .
we also support the rapporteur 's proposal to set up a special working party to deal with any implementation problems .
madam president , just a very few words to refer to some aspects of interest in this debate .
i had another question for the commissioner , which i hope she will answer .
so far , so good .
we shall end up once again without a new regulation .
the list could naturally be much longer .
the debate is closed .
the commission 's main purpose is to increase agricultural production .
environmental and health protection take second place .
where is the consumer protection here ?
what we are talking about today concerns consumers in the internal market .
this draft directive should have received the general support of the committee on the environment .
i will come back to this .
we cannot therefore support it .
there are indeed a great many amendments .
the debate is closed .
madam president , we had tabled two resolutions .
therefore we need only vote on the second resolution .
so parliament does not need to take action on this issue .
( parliament approved the request )
welcome
state of the european union
there are many reasons for this !
it does not even do that !
thank you .
you were absolutely right .
that is one reason why we need the european union .
the first task is to make the union relevant to its own citizens .
we will do that .
europe must promote democracy and the rule of law and respect for human rights throughout the world .
the european parliament has a key role to play in all of this work .
it is time to answer that call .
many thanks to the president-in-office of the council .
from time to time , we need to step back and ask ourselves a few basic questions .
but are we really aware of just how much progress has been made since the start of european integration ?
let us look at economic and monetary union .
so these are urgent matters .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , economic and monetary union will soon be a fact .
many thanks to the president of the commission .
yet it should not be so !
( applause )
together with these negotiations the union must achieve two important fundamental objectives .
i wish him every success in ireland 's presidency of the european union .
employment creation should be the number one priority of the intergovernmental conference .
i wish them well .
so it is time to act .
that is what it is all about , action and not words .
financial support from member state governments is much too high .
this also applies to parliament .
in our opinion the right way forward is another way .
monetary union with political union .
is europe there for the people or the people for europe ?
everyone in this house will say , of course europe is there for the people .
but if all that is such a matter of course , why does this european union not act on it ?
we wish you every success , and not only in the areas i have just mentioned .
europe - who is it ?
that is the situation we find ourselves in .
what can we do about it ?
lack of interest in the intergovernmental conference .
why ?
no .
that must not happen .
i also want to thank you for the speech you have made .
i refer to the problem of cohesion .
money .
what do the citizens want ?
i could speak about them now too .
mr president , all these demands have been put forward by members of the public .
but what do we have ?
this should be the agenda now and into the future .
we can not live without one another .
finally , i want to make two points in response to views that have been expressed here in the debate .
that will help protect employment .
we can only create a social europe if we have the economic means of doing so .
many thanks to the president-in-office of the european council . the debate on the state of the european union is closed .
thank you mr president .
( applause )
mr president , you are now required to ask the house to vote on the reports .
this was not called into question this morning .
it concerns a legislative proposal , and voting can quickly take place .
welcome
ladies and gentlemen , i wish you every success in your work and welcome you to the european parliament .
mr president , in that case , i ask for this report to be referred back to committee .
we think it very important to continue this discussion .
( parliament decided to refer the report back to the committee responsible )
i would like to speak again .
( parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution )
mr president , on a point of order .
i just wanted to say that i understand his point of view and to show him how i feel about it .
i hope that the council will share the views of the commission and parliament .
that is why my group has voted against some amendments tabled by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
i hope that this position will be adopted by the majority of my colleagues during the vote .
)
for these reasons , we will vote against the report .
why ?
what may the consequences be ?
this report is a step in the right direction .
will this approach be effective in every country ?
i have the following comments to make on this .
this applies in particular to the private sector .
this is completely wrong .
since then the importance of cooperation has clearly increased year by year .
clearly , the council regards it as absolutely vital that the european parliament go along with this overall strategy and we hope that it will .
those then are the main points of the draft budget established by the council .
it required a considerable effort on the part of every member state and a good deal of compromise .
this objective cannot but have a significant effect on the community budget as well .
the priorities of the draft budget are not the priorities of the commission .
i should like to end with two specific questions to the commission .
that is not provided for in our budget .
mr president , those are the comments from the committee on budgets on the council report .
mr president , enough has been said to have a considerable debate here , and i am sure we will have that at a future time .
that is why this is a particularly difficult year .
the debate is closed .
events in iraq
that is very important .
but i want to consider for a moment the general political aspects .
i do not believe that to be the case .
certainly all this is good , mr president , but on one of the central issues no agreement was reached in parliament .
the only possible compromise was to say nothing at all on the subject in the joint resolution .
we are part of the international community .
and you say nothing .
you do nothing !
that is what i would like to know .
the debate is closed .
political situation in turkey
we do still have good relations with turkey .
it is an important country with a significant responsibility for freedom and stability in the region .
mr president , thank you very much .
( applause )
i have been there recently myself . it is not a democracy .
but turkey is a country of great value to europe .
these conditions should be applied .
i am speaking for my group .
i want our parliament to express itself clearly about our relations with turkey .
we must state clearly what we want , and pay the price of it .
' .
nothing will be achieved if we take with one hand and give with another .
that is why i support the compromise resolution , though my group does not .
next week voting on this will take place in the foreign affairs committee .
i call on members to back up their words with action .
it seems , however , that such is not the case .
so there are many reasons to be concerned about the situation in turkey .
it is high time for the european union to use these instruments .
that is the question .
that cannot be in our interests .
there cannot be stability and peace in the region without turkey , only with turkey .
that is the real problem we are discussing today .
everything that is in the interests of the european union is good , cost what it may , even at the cost of democracy within turkey .
that is the problem .
i do not think so .
so , i just wanted to make it clear to all colleagues . i will vote against turkey .
i wish to state once again the main points of our joint resolution .
mr president , i first made that request two years ago .
there is much more to this .
however , with regard to this motion for a resolution , i would also like to add a few points .
so what is to be done ?
in this respect , i would like to have the commission 's position .
that would be a significant step .
little has been said about the local level .
these resources must be provided .
perhaps in europe that could be done by the european union or the council of europe .
national efforts are not sufficient , however .
in this regard i believe that everyone has an important role to play , we must all work together .
i should like to say a few words about some of the most important activities on our agenda .
in this area too we must take measures .
this should be done at national level , at european level and at international level .
this seems to me to be essential .
i believe all my colleagues have done so .
of course , we are going to vote in favour of the resolution .
i therefore believe that we should take strong action in regard to those countries , by taking specific measures including economic measures .
i would like a further response from council today .
this has been done in some countries already and it is important that we all look at the possibility of doing it .
well i certainly expect and hope they would be .
that is not so .
but a number of people have raised this matter .
we must face up to that responsibility .
we do now .
they certainly have shown that they are going in the right direction .
the debate is closed .
however , this is an extremely important report .
it has always been to parliament that institutions have had to look .
there was a very clear statement from us that we support this proposal in principle .
that is well and good .
the debate is closed .
rather , the european market is based on the competition between systems .
a number of other aspects have a part to play in this report .
i do not have time to go into this any further .
this is not true .
each and every one may have its own model .
this would be an excellent principle on the internal market .
there is no reason for this , and we have tabled an amendment of our own on this subject too .
the committee 's results were not very clear .
that is what the commission used to believe .
our international agreements allow it , and we must have the political will to do it .
i should think they can .
but no !
the member states must first agree about the principles .
that is obviously not true .
i cannot accept that focus .
unfortunately parliament has nothing to do with the tax questions and nothing to say on them .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i would also like to hear your view on this , commissioner .
it cannot work without money , nor without sufficient people .
this is right .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission has done some very good work .
it is , however , in the first place the member states which must take up their responsibility here .
but the union also has its task .
it is simply not possible for the council .
with less money it will come down to the commission doing much , but nothing well .
i support fully this programme .
many of the amendments improve the commission 's text and can be accepted .
and i want to thank parliament for its support in this respect .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
and i think this is essential .
this is the key .
we make greater requirements here .
and that is a crucial point .
how far are we now ?
that is not just a problem in this case but a general one .
that is absolutely clear .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is a particular problem in his own home country too .
however , we can only achieve that with the support of our national colleagues .
but that is a different problem that has already been discussed during the debate on the state of the union .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we have taken very serious account of their proposals .
unfortunately we could not deal with the new amendments tabled in committee .
of course support always means a certain amount of financial aid .
consumer representatives should also receive the necessary support .
i am therefore not in favour of amendment no 3 .
secondly , we need a common legal basis , which we should take time to think about .
i regard the question of the access of all groups concerned as an important one .
thank you .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
you asked to speak on a point of order but you are not speaking on a point of order , which is why i cannot let you continue .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
are they doing the right thing ?
that is the crucial question we have to answer .
we have therefore to understand that this instrument may offer a strategy for the future .
so we too need to know something : what are the community 's powers here ?
let me tell you my experience of a few months ago .
but europe has a responsibility too .
that is something our citizens can understand .
and that is why this question is so important .
what we really need is an overall strategy .
let it try to stop us !
will the commission be able to take the member states to court ?
we can only be as effective as the action taken at various levels , be they the european union or local authorities .
one is in transparency , as other members have said .
i can tell the house that the british government certainly takes this need for cooperation very seriously .
that is why we have to get this right .
we need to prevent it .
but , as far as the european parliament is concerned , was not there something in this house as well ?
is not it the european commission doing that ?
you want community law .
the conference had a direct impact on the current legislative process in the council .
the decision is currently being considered by parliament and the regulation will mean a significant step forward in several areas .
we must therefore work together to develop confidence and meet the public 's demands for safety and security .
the debate is closed .
the period that is beginning today will be very difficult .
that , ladies and gentlemen and madam president , is all the information the commission can put before parliament at today 's sitting .
he has had to return home on urgent business .
all things considered , we must respect the results .
what should we do now ?
we must not bring them home until there is more security in the country .
i am sure we will debate this in the future .
let us look at some of the aspects and some points of discussion .
there will be no peace without development .
the debate is closed .
it seems to me that an issue of that importance has absolutely to be voted on this morning when members are present .
in due course , i shall ask you whether you want to go any further .
there are three points which i wish to make .
we shall see when the time comes .
welcome , ladies and gentlemen .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
we have only just heard about it for the first time , which is why i do not think it is possible to allow this motion .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
i do not believe that .
it can only improve the democratic and open nature of european society .
this must stop .
resolution on turkey
that was what we wanted to say , madam president .
i regard this as a lack of balance .
once we had that everything would get better .
no more and no less .
resolution on iraq
madam president , the green group of course voted for the resolution on iraq .
and now what do we see ?
there always has been and always will be crime .
violence can never be acceptable .
there is work to be done .
it will not happen by itself .
and why is that ?
despite that , however , it is something and we will vote for it .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
we know that .
that is a matter of concern to us but we hope that , with the help of the commission , the council will in fact take this important decision .
that is essential .
that has been the opinion expressed by this house in past years .
let us hope that this will have positive consequences very quickly .
i did ask for one two months ago .
just say the word .
we are going to consider the situation .
the joint debate is closed .
as we have just heard .
european programmes deal with these questions .
they are often called into question in this house .
not because i do not think them necessary . i do .
this group is therefore against this motion for a resolution .
the joint debate is closed .
we have had a debate on it .
however , account has first to be taken of the fact that this motion for a resolution was brought by the green group in the european parliament .
mr president , a point of order .
madam president , after this vote let me say one thing quite clearly .
i very much welcome the fact that the compromise amendments were accepted , although many of us found this difficult .
it was my last in this house because after the direct elections i will no longer be a member of it .
thank you for all your cooperation .
i am sure we would have accepted them in committee .
there is one other conclusion , however , that i cannot accept .
but i consider it important to point out that the document is available , so that everyone can know what they are voting on .
( parliament decided to continue voting )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i have voted against the report .
unfortunately , not all members were here to vote .
it is precisely these areas that are of particularly vital interest to the member states .
that is why we should be voting in favour of it .
madam president , the key word in this report is cooperation .
it is an urgent matter .
this is not the way to encourage cooperation .
obviously , we have to have a joint commitment between the community and the governments of the country concerned if there is going to be success .
the reasons why this has not happened are political and financial .
so we shall be voting against the rapporteur 's amendment no 5 .
the available results must be put to the best use .
the second type of coordination is between the specific energy programmes and the general programmes for technical assistance .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
economic integration in this region is the best means to ensure peace in europe .
this cannot be enough !
madam president , i should first of all like to thank you for giving me the floor .
we did not really move forward .
the market economy is doing well , and it is making progress .
but there is also the social aspect to take into account .
secondly , i would refer to nuclear safety .
my third point concerns transport .
madam president , on the whole i consider this to be a good report . our group will also vote for it .
i believe that the amendments by the green group add something of this .
relations with russia are extremely important here .
it is important to establish a new european security system through cooperation .
those were all things that are already going on .
as to the other questions , i think i was quite clear there , too .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
this is a very serious matter , and we must take note of it .
are there any comments on the minutes ?
are there no more comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
we need an answer to the present crisis !
that is what matters .
it is the business of a parliament to ensure the resources are made available .
in these circumstances , all those who say that urgent action is needed are right .
and there are many reasons why , at this moment in time , that is not a good idea .
so the proposed increase will remain in force only until the other measures take effect .
that , i believe , makes the position clear .
but one thing , i believe , is true for all of them - help given quickly is always the most effective kind .
that , if you like , is a british problem .
the question which the british government has to address is what it is trying to achieve .
that is the way i see it .
months and months to discuss those issues .
other measures are needed too .
my last point is not part of the proposal .
one sector must not pay the costs of another .
this is not an acceptable approach according to the rules of procedure !
i believe this procedure is wrong .
that is what has always happened before , and it is what should have happened this time .
and what proposal is being made for dealing with this crisis ?
you tell us : ' no , solidarity , not responsibility !
madam president , the commissioner has made three proposals .
i believe it is important to make the best possible use of these opportunities .
( applause )
these amendments were at no time the subject of discussion in the opinion prepared by the committee on budgets for the committee on agriculture and rural development .
so i favour voting .
the debate is closed .
i would ask the rapporteur whether , if we take that as an addition , we can then include it ?
before the final vote :
however , this cannot be done by any group or by any individual member .
i must now ask the rapporteur his position on this .
madam president , i ask for the vote on the report to take place .
the report has been approved and can no longer be referred back to committee .
we have agreed on this .
but i can ask on behalf of the green group for the report to be referred back to committee , and i now do so .
that again is no longer possible - that can only be done once in the course of the procedure , and the request was made earlier .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
why ?
because i think it is very important .
the debate is in fact on the agenda .
when i say i am speaking on behalf of my group , i am speaking on behalf of my group .
i myself am one of them .
all of them , that is .
madam president , a vote was taken in this house .
you can propose it , madam president .
i will take a vote on that request .
we all know that these measures take a certain amount of time to be applied .
i ask for your support for that .
i ask your support for the amendments i have mentioned .
madam president , i thank the rapporteur for his report .
i think that we have a report and some amendments before the house that we can all accept .
unfortunately , i cannot accept the other amendments , for the following reasons .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that 's all , madam president .
serious consideration must also be given to the social and economic consequences of the new rules .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
madam president , i absolutely agree with that , because i only need to say a few words about my report .
that is very difficult .
we have a very full agenda .
we can not work like that .
we simply must not waste any time .
if we work quickly , then we can vote on it .
then we can get through this very quickly .
that is the only thing i can do .
that is one of the basic principles .
that is cause for concern !
thank you very much .
the debate is closed .
these proposals were accepted by the committee on agriculture .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
respect for democratic principles in agreements between the community and third countries
it is in this positive sense that we understand the content of the commission 's communication to the council .
madam president , this will take no time at all .
the debate is closed .
yesterday , we adopted a resolution on the international criminal court .
it is unacceptable that we continue not to demand the respect of fundamental social rights in economic and trade relations .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
why ?
we believe that there is a need for it in economic cooperation agreements , financial cooperation agreements and development cooperation agreements .
so we can vote .
there is one point i would like to make , though , madam president .
it only takes three or four minutes !
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
all we did was vote on the resolution .
secondly , we call for a major research effort in this sector .
three amendments to the text have been proposed .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution . )
was that on behalf of your group ?
all we have had so far has been a request to take a vote on it .
madam president , first of all i want to ask you if you have accepted the motion in respect of one report , as provided for in the rules of procedure , or two .
i think it is for one .
i have allowed the request for a vote on it . the vote will now be taken .
we will now vote on this request .
we now come to the vote .
i will take a vote on the request .
the request has been made by a group , and so we can vote on it .
the commission would like to say something more about this .
i would , therefore , ask for your cooperation , although i do understand current difficulties .
there can be no more debate on it .
who is in favour ?
madam president , you have done something very serious .
so i will propose this : no more debate , but we will vote now on the three reports .
do you agree to that ?
that is the content of our motion for a resolution , and i would ask you to vote on it now .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
could you not put that report to the vote , since we are all agreed on it ?
madam president , this is an important subject .
i therefore ask that the debate should take place .
i should just like to say what i think about this debate , which is being held here today in connection with the vote .
i think we have done that .
madam president , i do not like doing this .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
i know what that means . but let me say that the vote which we shall have to take in a moment concerns the question of whether we refer this report back to committee , and nothing more .
so i can do no more about it !
thank you , mr president .
that is indeed much better now - i can hear myself speak .
what has been the response from the council ?
and it is only with measures like this fund that we are going to create those jobs in europe .
first , there are cultural reasons .
we are now taking them at their word .
with these criteria , i consider the community can and should offer practical and positive support to this important european industry .
we will support it , at any rate , and i hope all goes well .
i should also like to thank the commission and the commissioner .
you know very well what the commission programme has been .
the debate is closed .
there are four important changes :
this is the reason why .
for this reason , i think that the report is an excellent one and we fully support it , including all the amendments .
i was the rapporteur for that report .
we can look at those in the future .
but what amendments can the commission not accept ?
the debate is closed .
do they not want it ?
then let them say so .
then let them say that too .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thank you for your attention .
this problem must be taken into account .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , what is the aim of the commission 's green paper ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
does the committee responsible wish to state its views ?
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
this is true within the union ; and it is true on the international stage .
it will be necessary to improve cooperation between the european institutions and the member states .
the commission was right not to give way .
economic and monetary union is no more than a means !
and the commission will apply itself to doing so .
what do we see ?
this is the kind of institutional reform that the union needs !
it will do so only after the conclusion of the intergovernmental conference .
( applause )
as we have seen again quite recently , this is the situation in a number of our countries .
it is therefore more necessary than ever to state quite clearly what kind of europe we wish to see .
we expect the commission to take those priorities seriously .
so much for what is to come .
what does the review say ?
this year , parliament is in a very difficult situation .
let me take employment as an example of what has happened over the last year .
what was it we said ?
more work for more people , one of the most important issues for the people of europe .
i should like to look back over two other areas from last year 's programme .
i have a number of comments about the right of initiative .
this is not the way that the agreements we reached should be implemented .
however , we must face up to things as they are , and not as we should like them to be .
i should like to make a number of comments .
it is moreover , in my view , a major issue .
this is no longer open to discussion !
i shall refer to one very specific area : the environment .
we shall support such action on its part , without which we shall perhaps still have a single currency , but we shall no longer have a european project .
as many decisions as possible should be left to the member states .
and in the commission 's new programme , there are proposals for more legislation from brussels .
all the specific actions point in the direction of a new state .
we share those concerns .
in other words , the public has had enough .
at present , we are 15 points above them .
as far as the single market is concerned , there is still a great deal to be done .
but why did you stop there , mr president ?
indeed , the reality is that citizens of the various member states do not feel themselves to be european citizens .
thank you , mr president .
we need to move towards a new model of development .
we too wish to see european integration .
i said the same thing to you last year .
this is a european union problem .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
i come to information policy .
we hope there will have been progress on this point by the time of the second reading .
just a few points on external policy .
but that is not only a matter for parliament .
but i must also point out the following points .
these are important aspects of policy .
mr president , since my speaking time is very short , i shall address myself to only two matters .
other members will be speaking on this matter , and i feel that the two points i have raised must be taken into account .
he was right to do so .
i hope that we shall be able to keep them .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the committee on fisheries would like the three following amendments to be accepted :
this amendment has already been accepted by the committee on budgets .
this initiative has not been accepted by the committee on budgets .
mr president , i am pleased at the opportunity to address you again today .
thank you , mr president-in-office .
( parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution )
each case must be considered in its own right .
i voted no to this report .
support of this type should take place at national level .
that is their job , i have no doubt .
does it wish to review the financial framework ?
i voted no to this report .
the commission has not yet adopted a position on this question .
that is a position we are prepared to support .
wrong .
it was not made then , it was made several months earlier by the european parliament .
that must be a real fundamental principle .
the council should instead have taken a serious look at the problem of where our structural fund expenditure is going .
the idea seems to be that the best way to make policy is not to make it .
for the peace process in ireland ?
in this area , everything is done with a total lack of transparency .
i shall add a final point .
of course they are not .
so what does the council do ?
why ?
what was the point of all that work ?
we had several questions we wanted to ask : where they were going , what they are doing and how do we pay for them ?
the first one is on the question of own resources .
i have one final comment about turkey .
in this context , the structural funds are an important instrument .
so what is the situation now ?
it is no longer open to the european parliament to decide whether any use could still be made of this money .
but we need to use them .
i would like to make some comments on the structural funds , turkey , and the internal policies .
this was seen in the recent vote to the european parliament .
mr president , i wish to come back on four points .
they remain the same .
there is only one commission position .
i hope that the commission proposal will be accepted .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
subject : international criminal court and human rights
subject : single currency
as far as the situation in the union is concerned , we have recently had to deal with two cases .
it would not be a good idea to go against that principle .
and what has happened since then ?
therefore we needed a common policy to ensure that competition in that sector should be real .
there is some competition .
i would like to see an addition to the answer .
i know that one of the projects is included and the other is not .
all this is true .
more however , could be done .
can this be a conclusion of the answer that i received ?
we are in the position of having recently adopted the relevant legislation both in terms of the financial regulation and of the guidelines .
thank you for your answer .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
i am pleased to see that this has come before the house before but unfortunately there was a different parliament at the time .
so , i do hope that we will see this directive coming forward .
i do not think it is just an issue for member states when you are dealing with an international situation .
they do not have an independent vote as an independent state .
good .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
and that is all the commission can do .
i should like to have a clear answer on this .
that is amendment no 12 .
it is very important that we get this right .
i very much value the commission 's comments on that .
this is the answer i would like to hear .
the debate is closed .
health monitoring
but a call to individual responsibility should also go out .
so what have they proposed ?
but , since then , the council has adopted this common position on the programme which accepted fully only a very small number of the amendments from first reading .
this was raised during the debate .
it is for that basic reason that we think there should be two representatives from each member state .
as for the amendments that we cannot accept , i would like to state our reasons .
it shall be so .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
water policy
this is not the right way to set about a european water policy , and we need to change it .
it was right that we should have done this .
that is essential too .
there are a number of points which i should like to make .
firstly , agricultural policy .
it will take time , but it is has to be done .
this too will cost money .
finally , energy policy .
this is another area where we need to take action .
it is high time that we did something about it .
i do not think that is the problem .
in ireland too we have our problems .
it is very difficult for the local community .
that is certainly essential .
water is life .
we have also had support from the other institutions - the council , the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
of course , that is not the case .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
i take it that it is a point of order because i was just about to close this debate .
i just have a question which i should like to put to you , mr president .
the debate is closed .
the situation is this .
no - this is a question of consumer policy and consumer protection .
there is one further point .
i have absolutely no idea of what the british government 's view is on this issue .
the commission asked the scientific committee for food for an assessment of its possible effects on public health .
but i very much hope that we shall have a clear decision tomorrow .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
you have the floor .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
we have heard your opinion and that of the commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , it is clearly important for the european parliament that we have this debate .
we have no such action or statement from the european union .
is this still the commission 's view ?
we must not go there making demands , we must go there in order to try to have some results .
we have the same conditions .
i have had no reply yet .
the measures taken by the union so far have had no effect , and more pressure is needed .
the question today is what do the commission and the council propose to do ?
there are people for him and people against him .
mr president , i should like to make two comments and ask one question .
the joint debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
we will come to the comments in due course .
( parliament approved the minutes )
mr president-in-office , you have the floor .
the first is a response to the real concerns of our citizens : internal security and employment .
thank you very much , mr president-in-office .
we now come to the debate .
mr president-in-office , the people of the union want peace in europe .
i asked two questions at this time .
in this case too i believe we have a positive reply .
its aim is to bring together all of europe 's democratic nations within the european union .
but there is a second important task .
we wanted the internal market . we wanted economic and monetary union .
even if the individual member states continue to play a major role , it is unacceptable for the european union not to provide a response in the framework of employment policy , or even to take the initiative .
in the proposal for a parliamentary resolution there is mention of a joint defence policy .
'
however , let us be positive .
that is good .
that must not be allowed to happen .
i want to ask the president-in-office two questions .
is that true ?
the importance is no less than that .
this cannot go on any longer .
the european union can do so .
how are we to make progress ?
democracy and transparency cannot develop without developing the parliamentary system .
it has been said that we should be concerned about our citizens .
and what will be the result of all this ?
we have seen important action , but it was clearly national .
i believe this to be absolutely essential .
action must also be taken in the area of internal security , the fight against international crime and in the area of foreign policy .
let me turn to foreign policy .
in the debate parliament once again expressed the general view that some kind of action must be taken against this country .
this is absolutely necessary .
we have to work together .
no single country in europe , no single country in the world is going to address the drugs question on its own .
we are doing everything we can in that respect .
the question of the enlargement of the european union comes in whether it is in terms of political stability or questions of security .
we have to keep both in mind when discussing the question of enlargement .
will there be another intergovernmental conference ?
this is the opportunity for europe to get on and make the decisions .
that , i believe , is in the interest of all member states and certainly is in the interest of europe for what we want to do for the future .
the next stage of the proposals for action in each of the five key policy areas will be brought to government for decision .
as a result of such a change three things would happen .
much more needs to be done if all member states are to be brought to agree on this vital point .
there has to be balance .
i doubt whether the countries in question will vote for the proposal at the intergovernmental conference .
and what has the president-in-office done here today ?
but we must do more .
i also welcome the resolution which we in the social committee have adopted through our president .
so what can we do ?
let me make myself clear .
what then is to be done ?
the second issue concerns the intergovernmental conference .
i wish to put a question to myself and to honourable members , to the commission and the council .
'
i thank the president-in-office of the council .
the vote will take place in a moment .
would that be possible ?
but you know very well that i cannot take the vote again .
it is very difficult to follow this vote .
without democracy , there can be no progress .
so far no real proposals for such additional measures have been put forward .
the aim is that it should lead to a framework directive on water .
there are two points i should like to make clear .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the europe agreement is a good first step .
i will end here , mr president .
this europe agreement is the first step in doing so .
finally , there is the problem of transport .
there is still a lot of work to be done .
i believe that i have the right to do so under the rules of procedure .
the joint debate is closed .
action plan for russia
but we must also be concerned about the social situation .
all these are matters for the council and the commission .
free and democratic elections for parliament and president have now been held several times in russia .
i hope that we in the european union will be able to make our contribution to those efforts .
and we are going to have to continue doing so in future !
mr president , in the few minutes available to me i will try to address the questions raised .
the council is aware of the case and of the concerns of parliament .
the same applies in the area of education .
i will list four of them .
this is no mean task .
madam president , while there has been some progress along the road to democracy in russia , much remains to be done .
democracy and economic reform need the support of the eu and this house now more than ever before .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .
employment and labour market policy committee
this is no longer sufficient as we have seen .
they also need the same resources to be able to follow up on the long term programmes which the member states have taken upon themselves to implement to create employment .
the proposal which the commission has prepared is good .
it will mean that we have an opportunity to make a real effort against unemployment at union level and that coordination between member states will increase .
i therefore hope that the commission will also vote for our amendment .
the committee can also encourage better coordination of employment policy between the member states .
we will now have to do this later .
but i would like to say that this is no solution .
each country must take its own responsibility for unemployment ; responsibility shall remain with the member states .
no one will expect the labour market situation to improve simply because a committee is set up .
that is the basis behind the proposal .
that is something this committee will do as well .
it is important to understand that .
i do not think that is the way it should be going .
let me go through them quickly .
i do not think that i can accept that at this time .
the first , the employment report , is a commission report .
there was some reference to that .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .
question time ( council )
mr president , on a point of order .
i feel that this is something that should have been put on the agenda .
i note what you have just said .
i would very much like an answer as to whether this is the aim .
i can say , however , that this whole area is being discussed at the intergovernmental conference .
secondly , the council will consider the report of the intergovernmental conference as a council of ministers and the various member states will put forward their views .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
i should like to thank the president-in-office for a very full reply .
we as a parliament want to see rights of children included within the intergovernmental conference and as part of the european treaty .
do you agree with his proposal ?
that was not the question at all .
not every member state takes the same view .
i was rather set back to hear the president-in-office make the statement that there were no proposals before the council .
so it is not entirely true to say that there is nothing before the council .
i do not have to say any more .
may i say , first of all , that there is no proposal before the council from the commission .
that is the essential point i was making .
i thank the president-in-office for his reply .
speaking as president-in-office of the council , i am not in a position to refer to the discussions at the intergovernmental conference relevant to the honourable member 's question .
i will give you quite a recent example of this .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
but this is only part of it .
let us also work towards this within the council .
the honourable member has raised a very important point .
i certainly share the concerns expressed by the honourable member .
this is a very serious matter and one which the presidency takes very seriously .
the single currency - the euro - will come into being at the beginning of the third stage .
i have only three comments :
what is needed is specific action , and i do not know if you have any in mind .
there seems to be a will and now we have to find a way .
this is a priority .
it simply cannot be done .
certainly we will do everything we can to ensure that resources are increased .
people talk about defence and security .
security is a different thing to defence .
the drugs issue is a security issue .
i thank the president-in-office for his response .
protection of financial interests
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
but since the convention procedure was adopted , we will help ensure it is implemented quickly .
because this is better than doing nothing at all . but it is not enough .
this must change .
it is a step in the right direction . we will therefore support it , but more must follow .
we are all involved in this fight now .
the result of this work will become available next year .
i am sure that honourable members will understand that .
the debate is closed .
firstly , we have a legal framework .
for many , these two things may be very technical , not political .
in my view , this is a good report .
but this , of course , is not the time to talk about that .
the debate is closed .
the commission , as i understand it , has all the information it requires on this matter .
so something cannot be right here .
we cannot , however , support all of these .
the common position seems to me a step in the right direction .
in conclusion , may i say : thank you , commissioner , you have done a good job .
thank you , mr rapporteur , we have made progress , and that is something .
i hope also that the commission will actually , when the directive has been adopted , ensure that its provisions are implemented in each and every member state .
i now turn very quickly to the new amendments that have been proposed .
i must also ask the house not to think that what is adopted here today can be implemented tomorrow .
then we may be able to do something .
the debate is closed .
you have not done so .
it is at your level that this must be done .
that is the treaty , the whole treaty and nothing but the treaty .
what are we as parliament doing ?
so why are we actually here and why are we working ?
second question .
so i want to ask why not ?
we still exist too !
what is behind it ?
it is a question of important research which is needed for the european union and for the member states .
we in the green group naturally support this kind of research .
here one has to ask what the european union and the institutions look like from outside .
and what is the end result ?
but we also have a problem with the commission .
in my view that should be possible .
but decisions also have to be taken .
parliament made you an offer , the committee on budgets put this offer , and parliament will take a decision on this too .
mr president , i agree , firstly , that the question is an important one .
a strong case has been made by members of parliament to me as president-in-office .
mr president , two very short final questions .
the debate is closed .
it is a fundamental responsibility for us all .
( applause )
are there any comments ?
can i make clear the very point that we were trying to make yesterday .
that is how it will be done .
( parliament approved the minutes )
i would like to draw attention to rule 5 of the rules of procedure .
naturally it is not the colleagues mentioned who are called into question , but the whole system ; a system which is not acceptable to public opinion .
welcome
thus , your comments will be taken into account .
thank you very much !
i feel that we will be able to vote in the best conditions .
i will , therefore , not be voting on this resolution .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i think that is unacceptable .
i look forward to being able to come back again next year and not have this debate .
it is a step in the right direction .
nuclear safety is important but is it an issue for the eu ?
of course i am voting for that .
i believe that there are many aspects of eu expenditure in these two areas which can seriously be called into question .
i believe this must stop as soon as possible .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
there are also many job opportunities for young people and women in this sector .
mr president , i turn to my own report .
in addition to that , we have also to work for the environment .
we cannot go on like this .
that is the point of what we are doing here today .
the joint debate is closed .
but there are some specific aspects of the motion which we do not entirely share .
that is my first comment .
that needs to be said too .
thank you , commissioner .
i agree with her on many points .
wrong remains wrong .
we have made it clear here in the european parliament this morning that turkey will not receive any more financial support .
the first , naturally , is on the humanitarian side , which the european union is doing very well .
and then there is a second direction in which the european union must continue its efforts : the political direction .
they must be given support .
what we need is action .
it is yet another difficult human rights situation in the world .
we look to the commission for its views .
very good !
if that text is now approved we will , we think , have a very good text .
it goes like this :
obviously the european commission must keep trying .
in this respect i naturally want to support the initiatives that have already been taken .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
thank you , mr president .
we shall thus support the joint resolution .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
a positive step is , however , the new joint action decided upon by the european council .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
( applause )
there are all those areas that have to be taken into consideration and not least - as has already been mentioned in the previous speech - the environment .
that needs to be taken into consideration in all commission actions for the future .
i would also like to end on one idea .
firstly , i would like to address a few words to those members who are concerned about the question of effective control .
i fully understand your concerns .
all the same , we cannot focus only on the past .
the joint debate is closed .
why ?
it is this that is really the important investment in a better environment .
i will deal with them one by one .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
are there any other comments on the minutes ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
the aim of the programme is very clear : to create jobs .
i shall vote in favour .
we cannot let this be done to us .
i wish you all great success in your work for europe !
many thanks , madam president !
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
( applause )
only a few member states have made proposals to the commission .
i call on the commission to ensure that this will be the case .
madam president , there are two points i must make .
first , i am not in fact the rapporteur .
it is the first report of its type , and is therefore very important .
i do so again here today .
madam president , i welcome the commissioner here this morning .
so that in itself would be one good reason to vote against .
but there are others .
for all these reasons , we shall be voting against .
but we should not have had to have this debate at all and we have to understand why this has been necessary .
i therefore believe that i have now said enough .
if we had received the same support from the council of ministers and the commission we would have made progress .
i would like to add a few comments to this general discussion .
it has been going on for about ten years now .
member after member has raised this issue .
it goes on because there is a lack of will in the commission and there is a lack of will in the council of ministers .
but they did not really ask the fisheries council to do anything .
they had a discussion about it but they did not ask for action .
mr president , i agree with most of what has been said .
this must stop .
this has been raised several times .
so all three institutions need to address this whole problem of fishing .
now , once again , we face the same situation .
mr president , i did not answer the first question , but i can say that we are discussing this matter with the council .
you will see from the minutes what my question is , and i therefore ask you to review your response , since it does not answer anything .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
this has also happened this time .
european rural policy
we therefore have a particular need for a rural policy .
the problem is the lack of resources with which to carry it out .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , what kind of rural areas do we need in europe ?
above all , that means giving jobs and hope to young people .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
two amendments have been tabled regarding this approach .
for this reason , the commission can accept this amendment .
it cannot therefore be accepted in its present form .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
however , we believe that this is no reason why questions should not be asked and the various sectors allowed to put their views .
that is why i would like to put 4 questions to the commission .
because of the budgetary cost ?
but those have been under control for a long time !
it is therefore appropriate that parliament and the committee on agriculture and rural development should be involved first hand in a matter of such importance .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
for all these reasons we have voted for this motion for a resolution .
thank you for your cooperation .
we look forward to working together with you .
( applause )
welcome
i welcome you here to parliament !
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
i am sure that you will do so .
thank you very much !
this is something i should very much like to discuss with you .
we cannot change the rules of procedure here in the sitting .
i have already raised a few points during the debate on the work programme for this year .
i wish to say one or two words about the amendments tabled .
that is not clear in our present rules , but it should be .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i believe that there are many more than that .
this is something that we must support .
the debate is closed .
environmental measures in the developing countries in the context of sustainable development
how can we talk about the environment in these conditions ?
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report . i fully support her amendments .
better environmental management and protection is needed .
the debate is closed .
these results give cause for hope .
what do i mean by that ?
it is an important document , indeed .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
while that may not be much , it is something .
we know how to do it .
no , it would not !
we found that they were .
i believe we are all in agreement on that .
why is it a good initiative ?
that is another debate .
i hope that the european court of justice will address this issue at some stage .
i do not think this is the right way to go about things .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , thank you for including my speech in the minutes .
' - if they come from !
( applause )
( parliament approved the minutes )
mr president , this was also discussed at our meeting yesterday .
we are therefore against urgent procedure .
i would ask the house to take the same line here .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
the commission must continue its efforts to improve assessment .
for this we need the support of the member states .
i do not mean here that i may perhaps share some political views of the court .
as the commissioner responsible for the budget , i have to respect the accepted regulations .
i cannot decide that these are regulations that we do not like , so we will do it our own way .
thank you , commissioner .
we need to put a stop to this .
why is that not so in the case of the structural funds ?
this is just the kind of process that we do not wish to see .
i have one great concern .
i have two questions .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , you have asked many questions , for which i would thank you .
what have we done here ?
but we shall continue to make progress in this area .
i shall come back to that a little later .
i am always available to come to the committee on budgetary control to reply to any questions .
i take my global responsibility .
but the commission cannot give in .
the debate is closed .
that is why the great majority in the group of the european people 's party cannot support these amendments .
thank you for your attention .
this is what is being done by the european parliament , in particular its committee on culture .
there are three important points in this debate , in my opinion .
the situation is the same in a number of other member states .
can we put it any more clearly ?
i do not know of any .
in taking our decision today , we must also consider the political context .
i hope the house will agree to that .
i have time to deal with just a few issues .
your vote is very important today .
only a clear , strong directive will allow this .
the question then is : can europe ever really work ?
i shall not go into this because i do not have time and so i shall just comment on the amendments which have been tabled at second reading .
on the other hand , we feel that it is out of place in a legal text .
more time will be needed if we are to reach this conclusion .
the debate is closed .
at this time , we can and must work together to work out the best way of dealing with this .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
indeed , madam president , that has never been discussed or decided in committee .
both i and the committee put a great deal of work into this report .
let us show that we have something to offer them .
but not just europe .
on these two points , the common position says absolutely nothing .
the vote is now closed
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
however , competition is not an end in itself .
we are making progress with integration .
in competition policy terms , therefore , this no longer makes very much sense .
and i would call on the council of industry ministers to adopt it .
indeed , that is essential .
action , not words !
i want to deal with some of issues in my short address .
we also need to look at the economic impact of these various policies .
there are , however , a number of aspects in particular to which we should like to draw attention in this general assessment of the community economy .
there is indeed a need for regulation in the area of environmental and social standards .
it was said they would , but they did not .
we have the means to avoid them , provided that we have the political will to do so .
this is also possible - again , it just requires the will .
i believe that a number of members of the commission could help to put a stop to this .
i have two comments on the report .
i think the house needs to take a very clear view of this .
certainly , something has been done but not enough for us to accept the report in full .
that is possible .
we all know that .
we cannot do this .
that is right !
where will they go ?
why ?
i do not understand it !
you should do so too !
a country can do that .
there is more to it than that .
you know what the commission 's position is .
there can be no question about this , it is an objective statement of fact .
i hope i have left the house in no doubt on this point .
this is also an area which comes under our responsibility .
i shall stop there , ladies and gentlemen .
we are , i believe , already doing what can be done within the current institutional framework .
and why is this so ?
you know how important this issue is to me and to the house .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , on a point of order .
commissioner , do you want to answer that ?
we can only encourage .
we must do everything we can .
there remains therefore much to be done in terms of research .
very little has been done at european level with regard to this up to now .
i think there are two important points here .
but whether this is a priority sector is something the council will have to decide .
so we are entirely in agreement on this .
so this is something we all agree on .
that is one point .
we cannot tell how things will go from here .
thank you for the answer , commissioner .
i have put this question before and today i have received more or less the same answer .
this is precisely what the presidency and the commission are doing at the moment .
subject : turkey
thank you for the answer .
subject : foreign and security policy
thank you for the answer .
let us agree on one thing : all these questions are to be discussed at the intergovernmental conference .
thank you very much .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
i thank the commissioner for his answer .
thank you commissioner for the answer .
thank you mr president .
i really have nothing to add .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
that means that it will not be possible to make a full assessment of the new system until that time .
i thank the honourable member for her kind words .
i thank the commissioner for his reply .
i know you will look into this .
it is simply not allowed .
however the council did make two amendments to the commission proposal : one concerning the procedure and the other of a technical nature .
the debate is closed .
i think that this is an essential idea which we must develop .
mr president , it is not often that reports come before this parliament on the subject of public health .
therefore it is vital to have this instrument in order to take appropriate action .
the system is also global .
five amendments are unacceptable to the commission .
a meeting of the council of health ministers took place today .
the debate is closed .
changes are necessary to achieve the objectives .
and so back to our report .
finally i would add the following .
the commission must of course take the member states with it .
that is the purpose of the commission .
it should give the commissioner a better basis for his activities in the commission and with respect to the council .
therefore we have a conflict within parliament itself .
it is a very serious issue .
i should like to comment on three areas which are of particular concern to me .
this also means greater financial effort .
there are some points which i would really like to bring out and focus on in the report , including the following :
i should now like to know what measures the commission has so far taken in this regard .
these objectives , as several have already made clear , and as others may well point out in the future , have not yet been achieved .
am i to understand that these are not accepted ?
the debate is closed .
at present the budget has not yet been finally adopted ; it will be subject to a second debate and the council will very soon have its say .
we have to agree with the commission that this aid is necessary from both a financial and an environmental point of view , and therefore we must support it .
this is important !
it is something we should be voting for tomorrow .
as we know , the purpose of the proposal is to create a legal basis for existing practice .
the debate is closed .
effects of certain projects on the environment
what did the council do after the first reading in parliament and the commission 's proposal ?
i would like to hear our commissioner on the subject so that we know the position of the commission .
i cannot support this .
therefore this amendment can be accepted in principle .
by way of conclusion i can say that the debate has been long and it has been difficult .
the amendments that have been accepted will further improve this proposal .
the debate is closed .
waste management
i can only answer : good question .
and it is an important area too , because the whole issue of waste management requires a fundamental solution , which will have a major impact on our quality of life in the future .
that is my first point .
agreements between industry and the authorities could also have a role to play here .
this contribution has made it possible for our debate to take place today .
the commission has therefore proposed this strategy for waste management .
there are several reasons for this .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
that is not true .
( parliament approved the minutes )
i just wanted to ask you this .
world trade
a few final points on my first report .
a new order in trade policy is important .
within that context the eu has to make its position on world markets as strong as possible .
will the commission do that ?
nothing in practical terms .
that is absolutely right , it is central to the position adopted by the committee on social affairs and employment .
that is absolutely essential .
this was the report that was considered by our ministers back in may this year .
so the time has come .
that is not right .
no more mention is made of social rights and individual rights than it is of environmental protection .
after all , what do we find in those wto agreements other what has just been said today ?
where does that lead us ?
i may be wrong , i hope i am .
let me give you an example of just one part of it .
so much for democracy !
there is a lot more which needs to be discussed .
this must also be the role and responsibility of the european union .
it is therefore time to deal with them in the wto .
the focus today has to be on the wto committee on trade and environment .
i do not think so .
let us see what the committee has achieved and what it can achieve .
the question is how to take forward the debate for the benefit of all .
that is the direction in which we shall work .
the commission 's communication was a response to the request from the council .
the development of this sector has , of course , been very difficult in the last ten years .
this industry has a future .
this dialogue has taken place within three working groups .
the debate is closed .
when ?
for my own part , i hope we shall be able to continue speaking as one and trying to be effective .
( applause )
between us , we have the means to act .
now let us show that we have the will as well .
i must congratulate her on that .
where do we stand now on that ?
can the united nations do anything ?
so what should be done ?
where do we stand and what are we doing ?
these are points on which we all agree .
at this point in the debate , we have heard from every group .
mr president , this is an extremely important amendment .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
this can be difficult in democratic systems .
we do not always agree .
in my view this is not to the benefit of the public .
however , this does not of course mean that we are not to show respect for one another 's work .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
mr president , on a point of order .
( parliament decided to continue with the vote )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
thank you very much .
we entirely share this view .
this is a view we do not in any way share .
in particular :
for these reasons my group does not feel able to give its support to the resolution .
and that will be it .
that was a good thing , though it was nothing like enough .
why am i doing this ?
a second reason is security .
there are further proposals for europe 's political role , which is a necessary and essential one .
i hope the union will be able to play a part in the peace process .
what more can we do ?
it was high time .
why ?
some of you here will know that already .
in order to achieve this objective , we first need the means .
they just want to live in peace and security .
it is up to us to help them .
we must not concern ourselves with these at this stage .
i would therefore like to say that , for me , it is not the resolution that is off balance but the situation .
that must be our first priority .
it is a crucial issue for the future of the peace process .
that is quite clear .
and indeed it is its responsibility to do this .
the union does not but it should have a common external and security policy - but it does have principles . and these are the principles we should bring into play here .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
i know we are all concerned about the matters raised by the honourable member .
certainly i will ensure that the concerns he expressed are taken into account so far as i can .
in relation to the second part of the honourable member 's question , i will bring her comments to the attention of the president of the council of agriculture ministers .
but it is a matter where circumstances may change .
mr president , this is not the first time that the question of human rights and turkey has come up for discussion .
we have only been in office five months !
i would like to thank the council for the answer .
i would like to thank the council for the answer .
we are in a union which has an internal market .
i will ensure that the honourable member 's views are taken into account .
but i will ensure that the concerns raised here today are brought to the attention of the president-in-office of the council .
for example , consider events in kosovo .
subject : women 's rights and the intergovernmental conference
the honourable member will understand that it is for the intergovernmental conference alone to consider any possible amendment to the treaty in respect of the areas referred to in her question .
in my question , i asked for a specific answer .
thank you for the statement .
i think there is general agreement that significant progress has been made .
i thank the president-in-office of the council for his reply .
however , the council is not part of the intergovernmental conference .
the task of monitoring implementation of the provisions of the treaty is a matter for the commission .
speaking on behalf of the presidency , i would add that i am aware of concerns in a number of member states about this issue .
i would like to thank the council for the answer to the question .
it is important , by means of a dialogue , to achieve changes to what we regard as unacceptable conditions in other countries .
thank you president-in-office .
according to the council president this will be done .
so far a proposal has not come to the council from the commission .
i believe this is an extremely important point in our report .
this , again , is the commission 's real problem .
but this issue has not been clearly presented to the public .
but that is not all .
that is what concerns us .
that is all .
are these sufficient ?
what we would like you to tell us , if you can , is what further criteria we can add .
i entirely agree with him .
the debate is closed .
asylum procedures
let me start with the last question .
this step is , in principle , a welcome one .
but i ask myself , if asylum law is not one of the most important aspects , then what is ?
because asylum law , an essential policy issue for the european union , is obviously nothing to do with the public , or with the european parliament .
but what content are we talking about here ?
i could go on to give an even longer list .
so what is there to say about this council decision ?
not much progress has been made at european level to develop a true european policy on asylum .
so what can the european parliament do ?
something does have to be done .
nevertheless we are concerned by two basic problems .
this is not only true for asylum issues .
the same kind of problems are also found in many other areas of justice and home affairs cooperation as well .
the debate is closed .
consumer protection
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we welcome the commission 's proposals and would like to thank the commissioner and her colleagues .
the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights says - no doubt with good reason - that the answer is no .
in my own country , this has not been the case so far .
finally , i should like to make one more request to the commission .
i hope this makes it clear that i am speaking in favour of both reports , as i did in the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights .
the debate is closed .
i should also like to mention another point here .
the environment and the consumer interest must be central to this debate .
my five minutes are up .
there is talk too of a green paper on food legislation .
there is no reason to think so ?
that is my question .
until now , that is .
i believe that we should put consumer protection first .
we always talk about the responsible consumer .
so my question is : commissioner , do you call this respect for the consumer ?
that is our information ; the commission seems to have different information .
so there too there might be a conflict .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i just wanted to say that the minutes are excellent with regard to my comment and that i hope that you ask the president to put my comment into action .
i am very pleased about that !
thank you .
we will take account of it .
( parliament approved the minutes )
energy policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
the motion for a resolution points to very specific proposals in this field . i shall mention but a few .
that can and must no longer be the case .
a sustainable energy policy is particularly urgent in relation to sustainable agriculture .
what we need is more energy to create a sustainable energy policy .
the last question concerns the future of this sector .
thank you , commissioner .
i ask member states to look seriously at the framework in which we consider it .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
there are , however , some areas of great concern to us .
i believe this can be done .
and at what a price !
mr president , let us get back to the point of the debate .
perhaps this debate will help it play a more important role .
actually , that is something that has concerned us far more in this parliament than many other questions .
but that is the reality .
i want to draw our attention to this real problem so that we can make a change of course here too .
action is also needed .
mr president , much has already been said .
now what can we do to achieve them ?
how can that be ?
is it possible or not ?
i would just like to make two points .
in conclusion i wish to thank all members for their great support .
i hope the house will take that into account - i am sure it will .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is not very often that we are able to vote in favour of a report dealing with international trade .
if so , what are they ?
this is a first part of the problem .
the debate is closed .
protection of animals during transport
we all know that there are several aspects to the transport of live animals .
it is essential to ask the question of what sense there is , most of the time , in the transport of live animals .
to date we have received little support from the commission .
here we must of course work together with the member states .
it should not do so !
that too has to be made quite clear !
it is there , it is a responsibility of the commission .
i have not seen them .
i do not think this trade is necessary .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
that cannot be allowed to continue .
that must stop .
we must develop sustainable fishing .
the european union has better instruments for such development policy .
these are matters which are essential .
that must stop .
therefore , perhaps he should vote for our resolution .
in the resolution we have considered all the points which are important for the future .
clearly that is what happened .
i take it that you agree with me .
let us therefore show a little sense about this .
it was quite right that this was so .
perhaps that could be considered .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
my answer to that is clear .
we in my group fully support the motion for a resolution before us .
there is just one point i want to make .
we have no policy .
that is the direction we must take .
let us hope that it can do so quickly .
we are doing so with our motion for a resolution .
the joint debate is closed .
the commission is particularly concerned in this case .
the joint debate is closed .
and why is that so ?
that statement does not help at all !
these institutions must obviously be subject to democratic control .
this means that democratic control over the institutions of the eu should be a matter for the national level .
we cannot therefore vote for the report .
the european parliament is not a proper parliament .
we have therefore voted against the report .
we cannot accept this .
the same is true of this report .
, rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
the new agreements are now before us .
they also benefit the community .
this is one more thing i would like to mention .
i want to say something further on this .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
madam president , with regard to the amendments : i have nothing to say about the first one .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the content of the agreement is like the others .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
there will need to be legislative changes .
we thank the committee on budgetary control .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
what is the issue ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start by saying something quite different .
and why is that so ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , we voted against this report precisely because we regard this as such an important sector .
i do not call that fair competition and i think that even the green group would agree with me .
that is why i am very much in favour .
thank you , because i feel sure that you will in future help me .
equal opportunities in the civil service
and that applies to both national and european civil service .
they set an example .
nevertheless , i would like to make a few comments .
we must do everything in our power to change this .
i hope that everyone in this house can support this amendment .
measures must therefore be taken to give them a more positive sense of themselves .
so the commission should improve the text of the directive in another way .
i hope that with this report we shall not only continue to help women in the civil service but also other women .
thank you , commissioner .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
therefore , although the debate is closed , comments may still be made .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it must also be acceptable for women to be in the employment market .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
that is what i would like to know .
i do need to see what it 's all about .
urgent political matters
i thank the commissioner for his statement .
what are you going to do about it ?
what 's going on , mr president ?
i hope this week .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his answer .
when do you think it will be possible for the conference to take place ?
i hope it will continue in the future .
mr president , there are three questions i would like to put to the commission on this subject .
thank you very much , commissioner .
it is a fact of life and a fact of law .
there have been previous relevant actions .
obviously we report on the application of legislation .
( applause )
that is all i have to ask .
to date the commission has not come up with new proposals .
much the same applies to the question of working time .
will he take these actions up on our behalf ?
the problem has nothing to do with freedom of movement - it is the problem of social europe .
i thank the commissioner for his statement .
i do not even put into question the value of such a law or the principles involved into it .
but that 's by the way .
i can do that , however , as much as i like .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
i think that was an important moment .
i asked her why .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the euro , after all , is not just the currency of the member states , it is also the currency of the community .
you did not want that , and why not ?
wrong .
' wrong again !
those , madam president , are three comments i wanted to make .
it will .
there are great issues of principle before us today .
mr president , today is an important day in the process of european integration .
i want to tell you that we have made considerable progress on all three issues .
the second proposal will be subject to the cooperation procedure within the european parliament .
that in turn will help to provide economic stability across the international global market .
in itself , absolutely nothing .
all of us here know that .
yet this is true of every country in the european union , and the others too .
we know that the european central bank 's objective will be price stability .
ladies and gentlemen , that is the situation as i see it .
we and all the european institutions must be in a position to meet those costs and those conditions .
i would like to make that absolutely clear on behalf of our group .
all the reports are excellent .
this changes .
that would go a long way to make the public feel that this was their currency .
they say this so often as if it is a fact .
i think it is very important to be clear about that .
let me also say something about the other projects .
that must not happen at any price , and that must be made completely clear !
in this sense , we feel the approach is the right one .
i have yet to meet a member of the public who has any confidence in this whole business .
the euro will benefit that .
how do we get there ?
but that was not enough !
that , however , is a special issue .
that i very much doubt .
the criteria in the treaty are clear enough .
why not ?
all of this , of course , with an independent central bank .
and there you are .
no question of a single european currency at the end of the year 2000 .
even so , it is concerned about a number of points which i would like to take up .
i can understand that .
in particular , the two regulations say nothing about the essential problem of legal security for the consumer .
well , the legal problems are considerable .
first , i agree on the objective .
people say they are responsible for unemployment , and for the public service problems in france .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is a long way off as yet .
mr president , the reports on future economic and monetary union which this house will be voting on tomorrow are very important .
there are two reasons for this .
i do not believe in this .
finally , i would like to refer to the cohesion fund which , as you will be aware , is currently available to four member states .
the people of europe and its citizens want far more than that .
the third stage of economic and monetary union is upon us .
think back .
it is the economic framework essential for the creation of jobs in tomorrow 's europe .
it is thanks to the stability programmes , which will be presented by the member states and approved by the council , that we shall be able to achieve it .
the draft before you is the draft of the new monetary law for europe - the monetary law of the year 2000 .
however , this article applies only from the beginning of the third stage .
i share your concern .
that will be the priority for the commission 's activities during the coming year .
having said that , i would like to make two comments about the amendments you have received .
however , i would also like to say a few things in connection with the amendments that he has not accepted .
so this is just an application .
finally , one more point on the amendments .
you never know .
what are the major points made in this report ?
here again we have adopted a number of strong proposals .
what that means is that we have no money for the future .
that second point will be the most difficult : it will be difficult to say , no , not that , this instead !
so what can we do ?
we need to take action now to create the conditions in which a new research and development model can meet those needs .
that is why i am pleased my amendment on the subject was accepted .
we know that the people of the eu believe the environment to be important and that more research is needed in this field .
that is why it is important that we also mention in our conclusions the social and environmental needs for research .
this is of course not so at all .
how can that cohesion be brought about ?
first , the areas of agreement .
as i said , i shall now move on to make various comments on specific points .
as you know , this is a considerable problem .
what form is that work going to take ?
this is the third point i should like to bring up .
the debate is closed .
public transport
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i welcome the proposals put forward by the commission , which will help in developing the single transport market within the union .
together with my colleagues in the transport committee , we have tabled a number of amendments which i believe will be supported and improve the text proposed by the commissioner .
we should make every effort to have a common position adopted for that date or at least by the end of this year .
this use of the resources of the structural funds should also be considered in connection with the european investment bank .
but what about women ?
then there is the matter of safety and security .
the internal market is still a long way from being implemented in this field .
may i make a few comments ?
the environment will benefit .
this is a responsibility which we must live up to .
however , there are several reasons why i regard the green paper as very crucial .
first , as far as the environment is concerned , a lot has been said already .
that 's wrong .
there is more than one side to this problem - it has various aspects .
mr president , it is my opinion that the reports we are dealing with today are an extremely good contribution to the development of transport to the benefit of european citizens .
it is a good thing .
that must not happen again !
the second effect will be to improve the safety and security aspects that are so important to all concerned .
today 's discussion has been a joint debate on the commission green paper and on two commission proposals for legislation .
the joint debate is closed .
that just does not make sense .
this is not the time nor place to go into that .
then there are also those matters of transport safety that have already been mentioned .
for all those reasons the commission cannot accept amendments nos 1 and 2 .
that position will remain .
the debate is closed .
we have had good experience of this .
finally , i ask : are we on the right course ?
so i am speaking now on behalf of my group .
i should like to draw your attention to two points .
but that is not enough for me .
that will take another six months .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
obviously there is a good deal of interest in this parliament on the british position on this subject .
we will look into the matter and see if there is anything that we can do .
( parliament approved the minutes )
employment - social security - structural measures
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i am here because , today , you are due to adopt three reports on matters in which i take a very great interest .
that is why i am here .
where do we stand with this process today ?
this is where the social partners have a key role to play .
this is another area where results have been achieved .
after all , unemployment is what concerns us all .
so what can be done ?
structural funds are a key financial instrument .
they can have an impact .
i and my group agree with him .
i wish to draw attention to a few other matters .
let us do something about this !
let us make a start on this crucial work !
what can be done then ?
i am therefore very much in favour of it .
in my view this should not result in a common labour market policy , since the regions are so different , but we must nevertheless work together , the union and the member states .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen .
that is where things are being held up because they cannot agree .
mr president , commissioner , employment policy and social security go hand in hand .
that must not be allowed to continue .
but that of course does not mean to say that we should allow a free for all on our labour market .
we need to think not just about the market of today but about the market of tomorrow .
they have come from the council , the commission and from this parliament .
what we lack is coordination at european level .
this is why we need coordination at european level .
can this be achieved ?
we must therefore find a balance quickly .
obviously states are responsible ; the public and private sectors must both be involved , as well as regional and local authorities , since everyone must take part in this process .
let 's use them !
i welcome both and i believe they form a basis for us to carry our strategy further in the future .
so we are making progress but we are not making enough progress .
we also agree .
the debate is closed .
i hope that that will be done and that a large number of the amendments adopted today will be accepted .
i request the commissioner to have another think about the matter .
mr president , that is what we agreed .
so this cannot be put to the vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
first , i should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report .
the importance of the agreement for the european fisheries sector is clearly shown .
so my group will vote for the agreement today .
if the council were not to accept this , we would have to consider what action to take .
this matter should be referred to the european court of justice .
this applies in several areas .
then we shall see what they think of it .
as far as today 's europe is concerned , the answer is no .
we consider that both monetary policy and financial policy can best be decided at national level .
it is not possible to believe in this .
as a whole this is a very good report .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
i shall not allow that to happen .
we have had enough of this for today .
that was not a point of order !
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
in effect , these two reports are concerned with the future enlargement of the european union to include the countries of central europe , a subject which is of major importance .
mr president , if the are group had not made this proposal , we in the group union for europe would have done so .
in other words , we are talking about years rather than months .
but using what instruments ?
i should like to know what people think about this .
i see from the nature of some of the comments which are being made that i need to draw your attention to the rules of procedure .
you will then have the opportunity of doing so at the end of the debate .
that is the position we are in today .
it is therefore not just a matter of individual will .
how do we answer the following questions ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , drugs are a serious concern to all of us european citizens .
that is not true .
the debate is closed .
now where is it ?
so far , no response has been given to the demands made on this subject by me and by several of my colleagues .
the commission is pleased to be able to accept the current compromise text .
parliament will thus have the opportunity to express its opinion on this important matter at first reading .
the debate is closed .
another important aim is to protect the community 's financial interests .
i should like to mention one final point .
that is quite clear .
the debate is closed .
the way towards the creation of european political parties must remain open .
they must respect the fundamental principles of the union treaty : democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law .
but we also think that decisions in the european parties must be taken by majority voting .
there are now a number of decisions to be taken .
if we really wish to make progress , we must take account of the decisions reached at the intergovernmental conference in amsterdam .
my group will be voting in favour of the resolution , for two reasons .
that is what i should like to do in this case .
i regard that as a key question .
that is why i congratulate the rapporteur .
and that is why we shall vote in favour of the report .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , without political parties there can be no democracy .
we think not .
the question , in fact , is one of how to form political will at european level .
we , on the other hand , believe that there is no such thing as a european people .
what is the situation today ?
finally , i would expect that it may take some time for some people to understand and implement the principles set out in this report , but they will .
parties are created and given life by the people .
there can be no european democracy without european parties and communication at a european level .
this means that the question of political parties in europe is , at the same time , a question of the role of the european parliament .
of course they do , and they are able to do so .
they simply need more transparency .
there can be no democracy without a party system .
the debate is closed .
however , we have not yet reached that stage .
firstly , there is the idea of giving social dialogue a more established position in the work of the institutions .
how are citizens to become involved in these issues ?
it must also be a debate about the content of european economic and social policies .
thank you for your attention , and i again congratulate the rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
nor have we heard anything from the council .
mr president , the committee on fisheries has decided to accept the council 's request for urgent procedure .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
mr president , i should firstly like to say something to the commission and the council .
i welcome the fact , moreover , that the president of the commission is present .
the same applies to the present case .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
in our view , that is unacceptable .
that is quite unacceptable .
firstly , there is the field of asylum policy .
i do not refer , you understand , to one single member state - far from it .
mr president , i have four comments to make about the commission 's work programme .
this is just one example of why we need some kind of framework .
the final example is energy .
there is no mention of health and i should like to know why .
only that will create jobs in the long term .
that means that cohesion has still to be a concern for all of us .
i should now like to refer to a second , completely different issue .
i shall give just one example which , i believe , is particularly significant .
i wish to thank them .
the problem of unemployment is , in my view , fundamental .
a number of other points were made , particularly with regard to monetary union .
i have never seen monetary union as an end in itself , but as the instrument of a policy of economic and social development .
a number of other matters have been raised .
we must provide an appropriate , positive and effective response to these problems .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this decision must be taken , if there is a request , when the vote is taken and not now .
in a sense this is saying that we are at the end of the road as far as the budget council is concerned .
we need to talk to the commission about the committee on energy , research and technology 's priorities .
finally , we must have a new dialogue on agriculture for next year .
an even better result would have been possible - better for all the institutions involved .
they can only come from an agreement between the three institutions .
we now have three union priorities which we have wanted to support from the very beginning .
let us hope for the success of these two programmes .
there is no point in giving with one hand and taking away with the other .
it is very appropriate : ' i never think about the future , it comes soon enough ' .
that was also the case at first reading ; it was the case before and after it , and it will also be the case in future .
it is a very small amount of money .
we have done that this year but we cannot continue to do it for ever .
this is not to say that i do not believe that there should not be financial control : there is a need for financial control .
mr president , i wish to make just two comments .
the main point i have not yet mentioned is the legal basis .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we need to carry on the fight against drugs at all levels .
parliament must take this matter very seriously .
that is the urgent wish of consumers , and we must do justice to that wish !
however , that was clearly not available .
but that is not all .
in view of the above , we cannot vote for the report .
what could the reason for this be ?
we do not know .
but , there must of course be cooperation between the governments of the member states on these issues .
and in view of the human rights situation in turkey it is , in my view , both possible and acceptable for us to adopt the same approach as the majority of the committee on budgets did yesterday .
i have one final comment .
however , things cannot continue like this .
that is something we are trying to change .
the debate is closed .
there is no point in discussing them ; they exist , and they are as they are .
so we are really not much further forward on this important issue than we were six months ago .
it does not need to be .
enlargement is a political decision , not a financial one .
the more successful this strategy is , the less enlargement will cost .
the costs , and not just for the eu budget , may become very high if this strategy does not work .
we all know that this cannot be .
but things will happen , even if we do nothing .
as for these other aspects we shall present some amendments .
only those who rule themselves out should be left outside .
so i believe that we shall have to consider new needs here .
the second major problem is agriculture .
mr president , what is our european union ?
there are different views , of course .
so there are different views here .
that is common sense .
the union 's fundamental aim , enlargement , is very welcome for economic and political reasons .
this has to be a good thing .
i wish to make five comments on the debate .
as many people have said here today , the impact of enlargement on agricultural and structural policies is important .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
here too there has been enough talking : it is high time for action !
nor will that happen , however .
we know what the impact will be .
various people have already said , and i agree with them , that this is not possible .
so that is out of the question .
so what can we do ?
i believe this to be fundamental when it comes to talking about the problems of enlargement .
it is a very welcome report .
what is this all about ?
and what will you do then ?
what will happen ?
that is what you are doing .
i think that european agriculture , after enlargement , can look forward to the future with great confidence .
europe 's farmers cannot do everything all at once .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
subject : the situation of children in iraq
naturally , the commission will not change its policy simply because this decision was taken yesterday .
i share your opinion that , at present , we can only hope that these measures will together achieve the effect we all wish to see .
moreover , this is the procedure that we are always required to adopt in such cases .
thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
we cannot accept this !
set an example and ensure that we no longer have to experience such an unacceptable situation .
this is as it should be .
my thanks to the commissioner for her reply .
it is a very appropriate question .
i therefore hope it will be in the best interests of both foreign trade and our own workers in europe .
thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
initiatives at a global level are also needed .
this work will result in a report to both the council of ministers and the european parliament next year .
subject : asylum policy
this is an area in which the eu can , and should , play an important role .
the commission does not consider this way of working to be effective .
i thank the commissioner for her answer .
we are completely in agreement with that .
i also believe there to be a problem in actually monitoring and following through the projects and the real impact they are having .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
however , one thing is sure .
should they do the same ?
so there is already some concern there with or without free trade areas .
we have done that in many other countries .
but it is something that will come out at the end of the negotiations .
mr president , my last comment is to ask you to keep up the pressure on this issue .
it is the member states .
you are quite right .
it is going forward .
we could use these resources instead to create employment and in so doing give our people a better quality of life .
this policy does work well .
that matter is also being considered in so far as the overall public health situation is concerned .
i have a question which takes us a little further forward and i am certain i will not get an answer to it .
you are right , of course .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
thank you for your answer .
thank you very much for your answer .
that is the first question .
but it does not refer to the point the honourable member raised .
this directive , this common position , is a good common position .
but i think we will have to come back to that later .
so that is another reason for its importance .
perhaps we can say that here too , or then perhaps not . we shall have to see .
what is the point at issue here ?
i should like to mention three points .
why a compromise ?
the third important point is access to the system .
much has also been done for the environment .
unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the amendments .
the european parliament has to take this opportunity .
it is essential for the progress of the life of society .
the directive is only a first step , however .
this directive takes a rather different line on the matter , however .
we have tabled an amendment on this point , which i would ask the house to support .
the compromise is not the result of action by the council alone .
what would happen then ?
there is no transparency in terms of costs .
why ?
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much for your attention .
agreement on this issue was really a very difficult process .
i ask you , therefore , to follow that approach .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we have no great difficulties with one another in this context .
that is really not our problem !
it is a general problem .
those are , i believe , the issues we have to discuss here .
the debate is closed .
europe needs , the citizens of europe need , public services , services in the public interest .
this is the central problem .
i will give just one example .
from the budget of member states ?
that cannot work .
so far , so good .
on behalf of the committee on social affairs and employment , i would like to draw particular attention to the following points .
we doubt whether this would be the case .
this is a responsibility we all share and one which comes under our education and social policies .
this is a responsibility which the group of the european people 's party cannot and will not accept .
that is completely wrong !
i am not one of those who ask everything from the market .
that is just the point .
i cannot see that at all .
that is a real problem .
that does have to be said .
if you would just consider that for once !
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i have done that .
why was that not the case this time ?
i would say not both for legal and political reasons .
we are talking about competition policy .
we in parliament made a number of basic comments at first reading .
what does parliament really want ?
do we want the commission to stop doing its job ?
actually , i would .
for us in parliament and the council to say that we do not want it to is not the right way to set about things at all .
for me , it is quite clear that the commission must do what it is required to do under the terms of the treaty .
you simply have to say that you do not want the commission to do its job .
my third point , finally , is the problem of employment .
well , for once , let us apply it .
that is what this is all about !
no we have not , have we ?
moreover the conflict within the council is on this matter .
that is the reality .
accept the situation and the reality , all the same !
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we will look into the matter you have raised .
we will look into that .
mr president , it was a point of order from earlier on .
these will be the main issues for the european council . but we also have another priority .
it is also the one which is most difficult to plan .
the european council will consider the further contribution which it can make to this process .
and i will add one more reason .
but we can do better , we must do better if we are to benefit from the contribution made by the single market .
mr president , may i now deal with the third great issue on the agenda of the european council , namely the intergovernmental conference .
we come now to the debate .
what happened ?
do so .
but we need help too .
to be more specific i shall mention just a few relevant points : specific results in the field of employment and social policy .
what is the commission and council going to do to guarantee the principle of free movement ?
this is unacceptable .
i now come to the fundamental questions .
they did so , and it was a good thing they did .
that is the real problem .
we need majority decisions in the council .
the first part , citizens ' rights , is a very good part in my view .
one point which has not been taken up is the transparency of the council .
the reform of the institutions is a more serious business .
and on the subject of foreign policy much remains to be done .
and then the joint action on drugs .
welcome
so we must take into account the reality of the situation .
i do not believe there is enough talk about social justice .
people are concerned about the crime issue .
crime and unemployment are not just matters for member states .
( applause )
i want to be absolutely clear about what he means because it will have an impact on the vote tomorrow on the budget .
i want to be clear for my group as to what he means .
i really cannot understand from his reply what he means .
can you simply tell us now : is that the case or not ?
with the best will in the world i cannot understand what you mean .
the debate is closed .
madam president , i agree with the rapporteur .
parliament was successful at the first reading .
many thanks !
i would like to vote in favour and not against .
cooperation in these areas should remain intergovernmental .
i have voted against the resolution .
the aim of community measures cannot be to put the member states ' powers in question .
( no amendment was adopted ) .
the present government has two years to adopt this law .
legislative programme
the first set of reforms is legal .
however , it is quite clearly the third set of reforms that is the most important .
nothing can be done if the political will is not present .
of vital importance firstly for europe itself .
the question is how we are going to carry our work forward .
finally , mr president , transparency .
only then can we expect third countries to take it seriously .
and a point of order , mr president .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we too welcome the report .
it is simply a matter of having the political will to go further along it .
and why ?
but at what price ?
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
not all children in the union have the same access to education systems .
children 's rights should become a basic principle of european actions .
today 's children are the society of tomorrow .
we want solidarity ! '
both reports refer to it with good reason .
a great deal still remains to be done here .
so i welcome the fact that both reports make proposals on what can be done at this stage .
in this respect , however , i believe two aspects are particularly important in terms of the direction we follow .
however , we must not debate the wrong subject .
certainly not .
certainly not .
it is my opinion , as with many other colleagues , that it is only once we see some specific reference to this within the treaty that we can begin to make real progress .
secondly , the single european market .
now is the time to act .
not all our countries have the same legislation .
i would like to congratulate them both .
it is important that it is not only today that we discuss and pay attention to children but that we do this every day of the year .
we must fight this with all available means .
i also think that cooperation with these organisations must be further increased .
our joint efforts must continue .
i hope that the members in this house will help this convention come into force in our member states .
we should use every possible means available .
the debate is closed .
mr president , it seems a long time since we first discussed this report in parliament .
we must deal with that as well .
question time ( council )
it is no such thing .
would you from the council welcome that ?
so , it is of direct concern to a number of member states , not least my own .
there was not a majority in support of the proposal at that particular time .
when can we expect a clear decision on this matter ?
thank you for the answer from the council .
but this is not the first time the question has been asked .
they are questions , not just of concern to members of the house here , but which will be of concern to members of the council of ministers as well .
we have a very serious unemployment problem .
there is therefore still more than three years to go before a new set of rules will be required .
it may be three years but three years is a short amount of time .
subject : objective 1 regions
in addition , the intergovernmental conference is discussing the question of transparency .
i would like to thank the president-in-office for his response .
i just want to point to one specific example .
first , i must take the honourable member to task . he said he did not get a reply to his question .
mr president , thank you for that answer .
unfortunately , i believe this is still not the case .
i did make reference to this in reply to an earlier question .
the council could not agree to this .
the council would like to take a decision on this before the end of this year .
what is the council 's strategy for having the un standards implemented in every member state of the union ?
i thank the council for its answer .
thank you for the answer from the council of ministers .
the question is , therefore : can we in the eu help ?
i know that the issue has been discussed in the council and that it is included as part of the work of the commission .
can the eu help in any other way ?
but the issue is much more than that .
i thank the president-in-office for that response .
certainly it is my view that the legislation , as set out , should apply to circumstances of that kind .
that is a matter for member states to apply themselves .
1 )
what has been achieved since then ?
thank you for your answer .
i would like to know whether the council can take can take special measures in this regard .
he has also been very successful in his work and we have a very serious report as a result .
this is really a very difficult directive .
because what do we need ?
we need a large majority in this house for the amendments which are acceptable .
and secondly we need the commission to be able to accept these amendments .
that is what this is all about .
this is one of the most important labour law issues to come before this house for quite some time .
i hope the house will support that .
i should also like to make reference to article 3 ( 3 ) , where member states may adopt measures to guarantee their workers ' interests in this regard as well .
therefore it is acceptable .
it is a real step forward and i congratulate the house on their efforts .
i think this has been an excellent example of parliament and the commission working together and i hope that the council will receive it in that light .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken tomorrow morning .
that is the general view .
there are three points i would particularly like to stress .
the committee on fisheries has also taken this opportunity to state its serious concern regarding this situation .
we see that in terms of human rights .
the debate is closed .
water quality
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i wish to comment on a few important amendments in my report .
why not ?
it is also necessary to take an overall view of the problem .
i have questions on two points .
first of all the scope of application .
i believe this in itself is a step forward .
why should we do that ?
those were the questions i wanted to put to the commissioner .
however , it is not sufficient in this regard to look at the legal basis .
it is that proposal that is before us now .
finally , i would like to make two very short comments .
that will cost money , a lot of money .
in any case they must and will have the opportunity to make the necessary investment .
what are we going to be using ?
secondly , the costs .
mr president , i want to return to the question of cost .
that is not the case .
when work is carried out , results are achieved .
there are many areas in which the commission is in agreement with the committee 's amendments .
however i shall make comment on some of them .
this can be accepted in principle .
madam commissioner , i too would like to thank you very much for trying to answer many of the issues raised .
the debate is closed .
it was not on my own account .
this has to be a priority , and we must act quickly .
european funds were used there too .
i therefore welcome the european commission 's communication and this report .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i wanted to make a comment on the minutes .
as for the second , we have to stand by the resolutions we have adopted .
( parliament approved the minutes )
welcome
mr president , i think this is an extremely important vote .
we all know that .
ladies and gentlemen , parliament has made a decision , like it or not .
what could we achieve ?
mr president , this is not about a debate , it is about equal rights for all .
this has nothing to do with debate and everything to do with democracy .
i too should like to be allowed to comment on this matter .
and you know it .
but then we really must get on with the vote .
obviously , it must be implemented in the same way .
we must all work together to improve the budgetary dialogue procedure which , by its very nature , will continue to be as difficult as it is essential .
but that is for the future and for others to deal with .
i want also to thank the commissioner .
mr president , i asked for the floor before this vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
so in my opinion we should vote against .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
statement by the president
ladies and gentlemen , that 's it !
we have to be different !
we thank you for that .
these reforms were necessary , they have to continue .
you will be doing so again , today , tomorrow and the day after .
my thanks to you .
we congratulate you on a job very well done .
thank you for all the work you have done on our behalf .
we thank you for that as well .
and that is why , on behalf of our group , i offer you our respect and our thanks .
i thank you for it .
they are very long .
i hope everyone is clear about this .
this applies to the amendment as well .
i really do not think that we should vote on this report today .
that being so , i am well aware that the situation is a difficult one .
since that is not the case , i think we can continue the vote .
ladies and gentlemen , i really do not think that 's possible .
members cannot be asked to vote on a text when they do not fully understand it .
this is an extremely important debate for the future of social europe and we should continue with the vote now .
you said that this house should never vote on anything that it does not understand .
that is my question .
indeed , i have just said so .
we may not have sufficient members to take a proper decision on this issue and we need to make a clear statement to the commission .
this report does three things .
i thank them for their efforts .
the proposal for a directive which is before us takes account of the changes that have taken place since then , both technical and scientific .
( the 15 years proposed by the commission are appropriate . )
obviously i will vote in favour .
i think that that would be a way of promote the defence of human rights in the world .
it is extremely important that those european states which wish to become members of the european union be allowed to do so , provided they take a democratic decision on the issue .
however , it should also be said that they have given much to the eu in return .
this means that i will vote for the report .
first , the lack of clear political objectives .
cooperation really must be increased in this area .
a large and significant part of this work concerns the area of justice and home affairs .
that , after all , is the subject of our debate .
what about progress with freedom of movement in the european union ?
nothing doing , there 's been no progress .
nothing doing , no such thing .
what about cooperation on matters of justice in the european union ?
there is not any , there has not even been a start made .
quite right .
so why is not there one ?
and why is not there ?
that is the way things are .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the political objectives are clear : freedom , security , justice and law and order within the european union .
why do all the groups need to act ?
madam president , there is a lack of movement in the area of justice and home affairs .
i hope you will allow me , madam president , to call your attention to that point .
ladies and gentlemen , the debate is closed .
great progress has been made .
i have to tell you from my experience that is not the case .
thank you , minister .
it goes far further than we could support .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
there is an additional impact on our environment and there is an additional stress on our citizens .
many thanks , mr president .
what is far less certain is whether the same is true of health .
to that extent , it does indeed have some connection with workers ' health .
there is more to life than work and production .
let me take the issue of principle first .
next , there is the practical aspect to be considered .
let us rather talk about the freedom of the individual to decide when to work and when to have a day off .
i note that all the draft resolutions call upon member states to take appropriate action and that no action is called for on the part of the commission .
your group could have asked for the floor at the appropriate time instead of using that procedure .
the joint debate is closed .
the joint debate is closed .
why ?
they simply cannot .
but this may be the right moment for us to express the hope that this is the last time we shall have to deal with this problem .
turkey
why are not they doing that ?
i hope the situation will change before long .
now a resolution of some kind will certainly be adopted , and i hope it will be a good resolution .
why not ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
i think that we as the union must make sure that this does not happen .
let me make three comments in this regard .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will be taken at the end of the debate .
reality is different .
later , development projects should be set up .
mr president , i hope you will give me the time you just used up so that i can continue .
the fact is the measures that have been taken have had no effect .
so reform of the institutions is clearly necessary .
and something has to make up for lack of policy .
that court should be given the resources it needs to be able to act .
so a plan for the area is needed .
you and the european parliament were of one mind .
i shall add my own thanks , and even go a little further .
there is a second point i should like to make .
by which i mean that nothing has happened here .
and that is as it should be .
well , what has happened ?
mr president , there may be a different problem here , but obviously we share the same view .
thank you , madam commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
then we should not waste as much time as we are at present .
that will ensure that we do not waste time .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
madam president , a point of order .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
can you report now ?
i want to make myself completely clear !
but she is present , there she is .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
be that as it may , there really was a problem .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the powers the eu already has are a sufficient basis for taking the necessary action .
among other things , it is necessary :
i think not !
in addition , though , it is essential :
however , it is our view that there should not be any eu legislation in this respect .
a measure of coordination is needed .
policy at union level is not necessary and there is no basis for it in the treaty .
we can go along with that .
but we wish to give our view on this , since the point is very important to us .
on the other hand , no specific proposal has been made .
what does the committee on fisheries want to see ?
i cannot support this .
i did not say that it was not important .
having said that , i do know that it is an important problem - we entirely agree on that .
well , there we are .
at all events , i think it is just as well that the matter was raised , because we are all well aware of its importance .
that is what i propose .
madam president , you are aware that some of us take this european parliament and its commitment to democratic values and practice very seriously indeed .
madam president , on a point of order .
that is clear .
there is no reason to go back over it .
ladies and gentlemen , i think we should continue with our work .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we know there is a commitment on the part of the commission to improve this .
but they did nothing about it .
i will not go on any longer .
i think you will find it very acceptable .
with regard to the amendments proposed in the report .
that is all that is needed .
it is necessary .
i have one more question .
i would like to take the last point first .
but perhaps if we could agree here it might give a good lead as to how things should develop .
mr president , just one final word .
first of all , i would like to thank the commissioner for his response .
this is important .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
that makes sense .
( parliament approved the minutes )
agenda
madam president , on a point of order .
we will vote on this request .
( parliament agreed to the request )
i would like to know what action the presidency has taken on this .
it only states that application of the rules is a matter for the rules committee .
i should like to ask that this matter be referred to the rules committee .
we shall do the best we can .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that is the only way in which it is possible to make progress .
the way forward from this debate must be based on a number of clear points :
you know my views on this .
it 's up to them to share this responsibility .
for the above mentioned reasons i have decided not to vote for the proposal .
these are the questions to which we must address ourselves .
it is human rights that are at issue here .
we consider this aspect of the proposal to be particularly important .
i therefore believe that we should do so in this case too and propose that we vote in favour of the commission 's proposal .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i should like to point out that the committee on agriculture and rural development has approved the proposal , with only one member voting against it .
we shall be involved in this process too .
i therefore welcome the proposal before us today .
this is a political problem , not a technical , budgetary one .
then there is the responsibility of the british members of parliament .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we will now move to the vote on the amendments .
( parliament decided to refer the report back to the committee responsible )
community structural assistance for ireland
we cannot and must not let this happen .
also , as the rapporteur has already said , it is essential for us to do more to improve the opportunities for women .
mr president , i wish to begin by speaking about ireland .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
so the programme has clearly had positive results overall .
in this way close practical cooperation can be established .
the problem is how to find the right means .
so what do we now need to do in future ?
enlargement is already the issue here .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i have several points to make .
finally , i must make it clear that this amendment has no impact on the european union budget .
such was the case , for example , in the current year .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
for this reason the commission does not consider these amendments to be appropriate .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
recently there have again been even more of them .
the main objective of this report was to look at budgetary and financial questions .
it says peace was not possible .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this first project was to have been a model of the common foreign policy .
finally , ladies and gentlemen , my thanks to all of you .
and now to work !
( applause )
thank you very much .
we believe you will do so .
again , we know and expect that you will do so .
we know and expect that you will do that .
mr president , we wish you well .
( applause )
let us start right now !
that is no kind of democracy !
welcome to the job of president of parliament , however .
we believe that we must be free to express that opinion here .
ladies and gentlemen , i respect your opinion .
( applause )
ladies and gentlemen , let us not go on with this matter .
it is not good enough !
that is the first point i would like to make .
the vote is open .
that is what we decided .
( the vote took place )
address by the president
are there any comments ?
( applause )
very well , mrs green .
mr president , on a point of order .
the rules of procedure say that the president may .
we shall hear the five members who have asked to speak .
mr president , on a point of order .
i wish to comment on the rules of procedure .
the rules only mention the president .
my question is thus a direct one to you , mr president .
i want to make two important points .
that , ladies and gentlemen , is what i wanted to say about this matter .
let us be clear that what happened in this house was seen by many members of this house .
this is completely unacceptable , mr president .
for the present , nothing more can be done , and this matter is now closed .
secondly , your decision to refer the matter now to the committee on the rules of procedure is the right one , in my view .
( parliament approved the minutes )
now i too wish to refer to the rules , since i too am a member of this house .
mr president , i do not wish to speak on the discussion .
i wish to speak on the rules of procedure , not the discussion !
they cannot , whether they be national institutions or european institutions .
we have , on the other hand , been very involved in the area of training .
mr president , i have always said that the single currency would happen , and that it would happen on time .
we were able to agree on the necessary compromise - a good compromise .
it is up to them to carry out the reforms .
our member states must have a sense of solidarity , and show it .
overall , they are positive .
that is my political line , the same line as has been adopted by ireland : the results are there to be seen !
i want to turn my attention for a moment to the foreign policy agenda of the union in the past six months .
such a role is crucial at this moment .
we thank the presidency for that .
european defence policy must become a reality .
we are all very pleased at the success of ireland 's presidency .
a new strategy for an old objective !
that is something you cannot change !
we are talking not just about a development but about a real change in the process of european integration .
i will just single out three different areas .
again , i congratulate you and wish you well .
what have we achieved on this ?
a final word , mr president .
the next step must be a move towards greater political integration .
above all , we should like to point out that there can be no talk of the success of the intergovernmental conference until the european parliament has full budgetary powers .
in general terms , one can say that the results were positive .
unfortunately , we also have to note that little or no progress has been made on other issues , some of which were among our priorities .
on the environment , we can say that nothing at all has been achieved .
mr president , we all know that the wto has a central role to play in the fair regulation of international trade relations .
the united states has adopted the fair act .
i hope the commission and the council will come forward with proposals on this matter .
it is particularly important to say that at this time .
if we are to achieve success in this area , we cannot do it by making agreements between our own institutions - the council , parliament and the commission .
that is now precisely the point at issue .
i hope that this fact will be brought home clearly once again in the summit discussions .
this applies in particular to asylum and immigration , and quite rightly so .
however , if we take that view , then it is time we made efforts to draft joint asylum legislation .
no .
but no action is being taken .
it is to you that we look , mr president of the commission .
that is why we need a system of international competition that will help to make fair international trade a reality .
the same is true in the other area to which i referred .
progress must be made here .
i simply wish to make four points in conclusion .
that requires an effort of communication .
the debate is closed .
i shall consider your request .
i put the proposal for a decision as a whole to the vote .
( parliament adopted the decision )
why should this be so ?
i have some further comments on the subject of enlargement .
but it does not stop there .
do we not now need to develop something like a new culture together ?
( applause )
the word employment has been mentioned , and i was pleased to hear it .
europe has its own role to play here , in addition to what the member states are doing .
there are , however , some positive points that i should also like to make .
these are the changes we should like to see in europe .
you are aware of this too .
i cannot find any mention of one .
the member states also need to be prepared to share its common interests and principles .
but , given the current social situation , this is not enough .
in this context , too , let us also focus our attention on the reforms of the european union , reforms which will be necessary to allow enlargement to come about .
without these changes enlargement simply will not come about .
enlargement is not a question of if , but of when and of how .
in this context , i should like to ask the president-in-office two questions .
much is said about employment , but no instruments are provided for it .
our interests are not the same and we have a different part to play .
we are all equal when it comes to these matters and there are not states which are more equal than others .
it is everyone 's responsibility .
that is very good . i am very pleased they are taking that seriously .
but i have one or two specific comments i want to make .
we have already had the first reading in parliament and i do not see any reason why they should not make progress .
well , she certainly made that clear .
this is what we have always said .
there are a few points i should like to make about democracy .
let me just say one thing here .
it is extremely difficult .
let me tell you this .
that is why we are not sitting back .
when we can go there and actually achieve something , we shall be sure to go .
there were three other groups as well as my own which raised this point .
if we are to do this , we need to play our part too .
the debate is closed .
these are being used more and more .
then there is the question of financial services .
i think this is something entirely new .
i would like to say a few words about the matters that the rapporteur has raised .
there remains , however , the problem of financial services .
the debate is closed .
i should like to mention three points .
it is not true !
no member state has such legislation , not even my own !
what will there be then ?
in all the other countries , there will be no legislation .
we know how difficult the discussions were in the council .
i wish it had , but life is not like that .
it is either something or nothing .
now we shall have something to work on with the commission at community level .
the compromise directive which we are discussing right now does not give any guarantee in this sense .
seriously , i do not think we should do that .
and why ?
so i would congratulate you on the result which has been achieved .
that is my first point .
secondly , six amendments were tabled at the time .
there are three key words .
the first is safety .
the second is information .
that information is now being provided .
but there is more !
we , at least , cannot agree to go down that road .
that is as it should be .
well , that is not the case .
i hope that the text will be adopted by a very large majority in the vote tomorrow .
we do not know everything about the consequences of what we do .
i am very pleased that we have achieved a compromise .
that would not be in the interest of consumers .
then no one would take it seriously .
we have achieved that objective , though by a different means from that which we proposed .
should it therefore take a first step forward ?
i try to use such means as little as possible .
today , however , i have to do so .
you know that there are no health criteria .
the relevant criteria do not exist .
however , it is my right as a member of parliament and as a consumer to draw attention here to the fact that there are no health criteria .
the debate is closed .
the result is something with which parliament can be pleased .
the situation now is much more clear .
the debate is closed .
not enough is done on education and training .
the commission statement is a beginning .
i agree with the commission 's priorities for development cooperation .
security and defence .
but i will take security and cooperation on drugs together .
we need more resources for this programme , commissioner , because we consider it to be extremely important .
mr president , we are dealing with a very important report - this is the view of the committee on development and cooperation .
we have political dialogue instruments .
we wish the report much success .
what will the consequences be for employment in europe ?
in the coming months , we shall see whether the conditions and political will to play that role really exist .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i welcome the report and the communication from the commission .
you are right about this .
the debate is closed .
this report points the way in which policies should be developed .
the european union can , and should , play its full part within this region .
we welcome and support that process .
but the most difficult task is to carry it through .
because most of the governments in this region do not see the importance of this at all .
how was this achieved ?
the debate is closed .
i think that amendment no 2 will help community citizens to understand what we are talking about .
we have created the term ' public service ' .
the commission cannot accept amendment no 11 .
the debate is closed .
we certainly need to continue with that , but it is not enough .
this is done in some member states .
at the same time i hope that european technology can be used here .
i do not think that is necessary .
that is our common aim .
mr president , i have always said that this is a serious and urgent problem .
i believe , mr president , that this issue should be taken very , very seriously indeed .
mr president , i will be short and to the point .
so this proposal certainly means progress .
the first is that the main thing is for a political decision to be taken on whether we should continue in this direction .
my second point is that the eu is not enough . in this respect , i do not agree with the rapporteur .
i hope that this will not be the last report that he is going to do for the committee .
i thank the rapporteur for his excellent report .
what is the commission 's view ?
the debate is closed .
public transport and state aid
a few comments on this .
in the past that was not often the case .
they have to do their own part too .
the second important thing is that there must be competition .
the debate is closed .
in other words : can he get away with this ?
are such procedures acceptable in this house or not ?
that would make more sense .
we will see that it is put right .
mr president , on a point of order .
( parliament approved the minutes )
the second issue the house has discussed concerns technical measures .
we must support the question of closed areas .
this seems to me to be a process that will not work , is not right .
i think that is , in a way , the right approach .
that is completely wrong .
i will mention just two .
no country had a programme which was sufficient in all areas .
that is the way we have to go in the future ; giving that sector the priority .
but i have to question the whole situation last year .
let me go back over two points in the agreement .
we welcome that too .
this issue will not go away .
i did a report on it myself some years ago .
there is a positive side to this , namely safety .
mr president , i wish to thank the commissioner for her statement and i agree with almost everything she said .
and i end with a small comment on the technical measures .
so let us make respect for the law the priority .
so the more time she has , the better for us .
first of all , let us talk about current events .
because that is not the main issue .
i do not want to go over these again .
the debate is closed .
and why was that so ?
let me draw attention to another positive aspect .
parliament took the initiative in this case .
statement by the president
i think i speak for all of you when i say that .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , on a point of order .
other people should not be here , of course .
there were two reasons for that .
we believe that each and every one of the eu member states should have a free and independent vote in international cooperation .
the most important task for the eu at the moment is to bring about enlargement to the east .
not to mention unemployment .
because countries are free to act on the proposal or not , as they wish .
this is why we cannot vote for the resolution on this issue .
i hope that parliament will support it without amendment .
we consider it to be wrong to place full responsibility on european institutions instead .
but consumers wish to know that .
these are the reasons why i have voted against the report .
with what information ?
we have had a few difficulties with the second reading amendments .
as a result , we could not vote for some of the amendments proposed at second reading .
we are pleased that this report has been adopted at last .
we welcome that .
the motion for a resolution is , of course , a compromise .
now let me tell what i do not like in the compromise .
we need to know what this money is being used for and what our priorities are .
this could take place within the framework of regional political programmes supported by the eu .
the commission will also have to support the education of its citizens , especially the young .
however , i would like to address two practical points to the commission .
there is absolutely no reason for the union to take upon itself another political area .
there is no lack of international cooperation either .
we will not have one like the common agricultural policy .
for this reason , i think that we should accept it as it is without any of the amendments which have been put forward .
however , just to refer to this situation is unacceptable !
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the two agreements together will ensure a good balance between both parties ' interests .
and i think that is a very important and proper objective .
i also have a point to make concerning procedure .
secondly , they make a real contribution to economic development and , therefore , also to the political stability of the region .
the debate is closed .
but on one thing we must be clear .
we are very much in favour of it .
that is i think a very important point .
that is one thing .
that is going too far .
let me now turn to a fundamental point .
but we do expect that the results will not only be made available to representatives of the social dialogue but also of course to the european parliament .
i hope that one day we will be able to do without them .
we must do that in order to see more clearly .
regarding the first issue , i very much welcome the positive approach which you have adopted .
the debate is closed .
we had one problem with the commission and that was the way in which it presented the budgetary provisions .
the commission wanted to include the budgetary provisions in the proposals .
therefore i , like the commissioner before me , do not need to make a very long speech .
i ask parliament to adopt it and the commission to take it over .
for that i want to thank you .
i also understand that you have proposed a number of amendments .
several of these are common to both regulations .
the commission will ensure that these reports are made available to the honourable members by means of a more appropriate information process .
they are of particular interest .
we would like that to happen also .
this is a subject that we take very seriously .
the debate is closed .
the council has also made many amendments to the commission 's text .
mr president , i am very pleased that at least the council is present .
what is the council 's reply to this ?
what is the council 's reply ?
that is what is behind this whole issue .
that is not being called into question .
that is in everyone 's interest , and i ask you not to think we are working here in private .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , we have had a few problems with voting in the house this week .
mr president , on the same point .
that is something the president might want to look at .
but now , ladies and gentlemen , if there are no more comments on the minutes , i take it they are approved .
( parliament approved the minutes )
i will therefore vote in favour .
for this reason , i am naturally voting in favour .
after all , freedom of movement around europe is central to our economic future .
from an environmental point of view it is also an important part of a sustainable society .
this is why we are voting against this report .
public transport is a national and regional matter .
europe is involved in the region .
but the agreements alone are not enough .
but among the many own interests at play , i do not see the european union taking responsibility for the region .
when the time comes - that will be at the vote - we will look at the question of your amendment .
that is why we are in favour of the report .
times may change .
the commission and council can now get to work .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we have the responsibility to establish peace in the region .
i see no really effective strategy in that direction .
but the european union is not doing anything .
that is why i voted against the report , but i must make it clear that i agree with its main points .
we say 1999 , they say 2001 .
the coming years will have to bring some reforms with them .
i think that is the right direction .
five years - but from which date ?
this is not what europe is about !
mr president , i think now that we can vote on this report and i hope that we can , after all , reach agreement .
we have to consider that too .
well , i mentioned that there are a number of views .
we need to be clear about this .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we should make that quite clear .
order of business
we now come to the order of business .
but there simply was not enough time to do that by tomorrow .
secondly , we would ask you not to take the report off the agenda but to follow the procedure on the agenda .
urgent political matters
and if so , how ?
the fundamental point is for member states to agree on the objectives of the union .
a few words in conclusion , mr president , ladies and gentlemen .
there must be a large number of states .
in our opinion the position as regards parliament is very clear .
first , the community institutions must be involved .
parliament , the court of justice and the commission must be involved .
there are issues we are still discussing in the commission .
that is the situation as i see it .
how can the commission prevent that ?
it would be possible if the commission took the initiative , but not if the initiative is taken by the member states .
the same applies to the commission and the court of justice .
what the position of the european parliament is going to be is still not at all clear to me , despite what you have said .
naturally there are , and i have many .
other issues need to be discussed .
but we have already had to face that risk .
i think that is the wrong procedure .
let us apply the criteria and principles that already exist in the treaty to the enlargement .
i have a very practical question which i hope you will allow me to put .
it would not be against the treaty .
and any measures taken must look to the future .
two points here . firstly , education .
much more serious , though , in my view are the political questions .
that is our problem , not the problem of the victims !
that goes without saying .
this situation cannot continue .
that must be our view of things !
the year must take us forward in that direction .
this is quite necessary .
what would you feel in this situation ?
i myself know very well what i am talking about .
there is not a great deal more one can say .
' .
the council and the commission have asked to speak through their representatives .
that is what the rules of procedure say .
i think we really must try to prevent that .
i would like to make reference to two particular points .
you also made the point that we need proper integration policies .
the point was made that a lot of talk goes on about this subject and i agree with that .
germany makes a very great contribution to european integration .
that is point one .
the debate is closed .
ladies and gentlemen , this is an important vote .
no one can be above the democratic process .
that is not on and we cannot have it .
it is a serious crime .
we have to be very clear on that .
i congratulate the rapporteur on that .
i believe parliament will take another step in that direction tomorrow .
a great deal can be achieved through cooperation .
in this respect , the objective proposals made in this report should be approved by the european parliament .
we must avoid this at all costs .
we must give this task our priority .
but terrorism is still a very serious concern both within and outside europe .
the fight against terrorism must continue to be a matter of high priority in the european union .
the debate is closed .
there must be an open dialogue between the european parliament and the council to discuss the general political guidelines for the year in progress .
first , the enlargement to 15 member states .
that is why the results of the intergovernmental conference must also meet the requirements of the european parliament .
but that will not be enough .
it is not that many years ago but we have come a long way since then .
furthermore , we are discussing a report on a report .
i have no difficulties with the first line of the resolution .
mr president , as we are discussing a council report should we not receive a response from the council ?
no .
why not ?
the debate is closed .
cultural aspects in european community action
obviously the european union could not be further away from that kind of thing .
so in my opinion the whole report is excellent .
he was right and i share his concerns .
and even if we are not there yet , we should nevertheless congratulate the european commission on this initiative .
of course , we should add to these the consideration of culture in the structural fund , which is a fundamental matter .
mr president , on a point of order .
it is a fair comment .
mr president , i should like to welcome you to the debate .
but how many people will agree with me ?
perhaps the services could look at this in future .
the debate is closed .
cost of transport
that must not be allowed to happen .
the report is therefore a compromise , but of a high quality .
it must be more than just talk .
mr president , mr commissioner and colleagues , we have a common task .
when we come to vote tomorrow , it will not so much be legislation , as the first part of legislation .
that cannot be what we should be doing !
that cannot be the purpose of your green paper or your proposals , and that is what we must ensure !
in most cases not really .
i have two specific questions for the commissioner .
i am pleased to see that view expressed in the environment committee 's report .
i should like to hear from the commissioner on this .
so far , so good .
my point to both the commissioner and rapporteur is very clear and positive .
the transport sector is one of the most important sectors in this respect .
the debate is closed .
research and sustainable development
so i ask that the report be referred back to committee .
so we would like to support the reference back to committee .
mr president , i should like to ask you not to refer this report back to committee .
( parliament voted to refer the report back to committee )
this is a vital contribution , a positive contribution that we make .
i am in agreement with this initiative by the commission , and i am in agreement with the rapporteur on the need also to take public opinion into account .
thank you , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
application of community law
these proposals are in the interest of all , in the interest of member states , in the interest of the union and in the interest of citizens .
cooperation with the european commission has been excellent and will continue to be so .
this is what this report is about .
we would like to see that done at last .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 am .
are there any comments ?
in any case , i say again , however important the matter may be it does not have very much to do with the minutes .
( parliament approved the minutes )
asylum policy ;
amendment proposals should first be discussed and then voted on by committee .
we always say that europe means more freedom for its citizens .
because we say : more security and less and less freedom .
it is no longer on the agenda .
and this should be the role of the european parliament .
but this cannot be enough .
may i ask what form such an asylum law would take ?
so , in my opinion , it comes down to two issues .
we must take action .
it is perhaps even more important than the matter of a national currency .
is this what we want ?
why ?
on the subject of amendment 3 :
there seems to be a problem regarding amendment 3 .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we cannot get into a debate .
therefore it will be , at the time we vote on amendment 11 .
this is all quite clear .
the debate on the content is now over .
madam president , i quite understand that honourable members would like to move on .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
' .
it does so clearly and often by a large majority .
fisheries council
we consider this to be wrong .
the report prepared by the committee on agriculture and rural development is much better than the commission 's proposal .
i have therefore voted against this report .
this is a matter for the individual member states .
with this in mind , i have voted against the report .
there are two important reasons for voting against this report .
this is why i am voting against this report .
i congratulate our rapporteur on her excellent work .
this text must therefore be supported .
the debate must begin on the problems of the real cost of transport within the european union .
both the green paper and the report are a good contribution to the debate .
this report is therefore a compromise .
this is why i am voting against the report .
voting time is now closed .
mr president , on a point of order .
this question is not on the agenda .
i cannot let you discuss it further .
i cannot allow a debate on the question now .
order of business
i shall now put the request from the fisheries committee to the vote .
( parliament approved the request )
mrs green has the floor .
there are four reasons for this .
nuclear safety cooperation is also important .
just think : in this way , nuclear power could promote world peace .
it is that aspect i am concerned with today .
that is a very great deal .
that would be the best policy for the environment , mr president . but we talk a lot and i do not think we are doing much .
above all it needs monitoring .
i believe this to be completely unacceptable as a policy for the european union or its member states .
mr president , i have another question for the commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is why we are now in a position to reach some general conclusions .
what , or who , is most important here ?
i believe that the committee on regional policy and the european commission should work hard this year to begin to look at and review these regulations .
in this connection , i have tabled an amendment that is to be discussed tomorrow .
we must therefore find a solution before 1999 , in the framework of the next structural fund review .
i hope this will also be of help in terms of future developments .
the debate is closed .
development problems in germany
we support it entirely .
i think we should look at the situation in practical terms .
that applies in particular to objective 2 .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i refer you to paragraph 12 of the resolution .
provided there was growth , all was well .
so what should we go for ?
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i , too , would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
so environmental protection must be a crucial objective of regional policy .
but there is always a ' but ' .
sometimes more than one .
first , i note that the results of the cohesion policies in terms of regional development are positive overall .
madam president , i think that , on the whole , we have a good report before us .
i think this is a very important issue .
i think that is the report 's objective framework .
we must not expect things of this report that it cannot and should not provide .
but why ?
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
that is absolutely wrong .
thank you , mrs green .
i have put forward an amendment on this .
so this is another point on which i have tabled an amendment .
there is one final comment i should like to make .
for this reason , we have tabled an amendment .
the debate is closed .
social protection
i would therefore ask you to vote in favour of my report .
mr president , i should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to parliament on this very important subject which is before the house today .
today 's debate has shown that this is an issue of particular importance to all the institutions and in particular to parliament .
social cohesion in other member states is now in all our interests .
i think this is really all that needs to be said .
mr president , when we speak of the future of social protection in europe , we are at the same time speaking about the whole future of europe .
i entirely agree with this .
there is just one more point i should like to make about this whole situation .
i think it too much to expect that citizens in the european union will want to move from one member state to another .
that is a point which we will support .
where there is unemployment , clearly , there can be no social security .
there are a few points i should like to make in the three minutes available to me .
all well and good .
in other words , proper social security costs money .
i hope that this debate on the commission communication will finally lead to effective european action in this field .
it is important to discuss these issues at european level .
however , discussion is not enough .
this is an area where action must be taken .
the future of social protection is a matter of great importance for the european union .
the question is sometimes asked , is there really a european social model ?
this is not the case .
i do not think so .
finally , mr president : this is an important debate .
unemployment , therefore , has been the main reason for the crisis .
i shall be voting in favour of both .
thank you very much .
the debate is closed .
there was also some concern about the euro .
i hope that you will support these amendments .
i want to say why we feel this confidence at this stage .
this is a very difficult directive for the european parliament to consider .
with the best will in the world , what does this mean ?
it seems to me that the commission 's text is far better than the one being proposed in the report .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this directive .
we therefore agree with the directive and also support the committee 's amendments .
having said that , i would like to draw the commission 's attention to two questions .
mr president , there are a few points i feel i have to make to the commission and also to other members .
i would very much like to have an answer to this .
i wish to thank the rapporteur again for her very good work .
but this is not what i want .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i put that to the house .
therefore , i feel we cannot vote on it .
that has not been done , but the amendment was indeed tabled .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we cannot therefore vote for a proposal which does not reform the current system .
the next item is the joint debate on :
there is a common interest here , for both consumers and farmers .
a resolution has now been tabled which has the support of several groups .
( applause )
there are no political representatives of the council present .
that is all i know , and all that i can tell you .
ladies and gentlemen , we are dealing with an extremely important matter .
if that were to happen , how would they vote ?
there is still time for you to do so !
it clearly should have .
the member states did not want them to .
the commission has put forward proposals to this effect .
i see two essential requirements here .
i believe , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , that the time has come to create a europe of health .
( applause )
my group does not believe that to be the case .
( applause )
i would even say that the members of the committee have done more .
( applause )
we are left with the question of how we are to protect consumers .
but that did not happen .
measures were taken , but they were not implemented .
what did happen ?
we want actions , not words .
these have always been our demands .
what is to be done ?
what do we see ?
and the european parliament : what did it do ?
parliament was aware of the problem .
i can not believe that !
i believe that this is the fundamental question , therefore .
madam president , on a point of order .
what is done is done .
they must be able to believe in us , so that they continue to believe in europe .
we need strong political direction of the commission as a whole .
the important thing is that you should take political responsibility for what is your task .
but problem number one is the problem of decision .
i have to take issue with many of the points that have been made .
i would have voted against the report had i been there .
nothing i have heard in this debate would cause me to change my mind .
and what of public health ?
that would be excellent - nothing would have more support from me .
you have often said this .
you have already said this before .
do it !
say that to us !
these are all specific things which you could have said .
but you did not do so .
that is really what we need !
it has a present , and here i should like to be more specific .
it is a responsibility of the present commission : it is your responsibility .
one thing does not prevent the other !
i know that it is very difficult to do so .
the president of the commission has to take that into account now in what he does .
what we are trying to do is find european solution for what is - like it or not - a european problem .
that is why i like you , and why i wish to do you a favour .
and why ?
you will do us a service , and you will do a service to the europe in which you believe .
how many people will be involved ?
what will the budget be ?
and these are my second and third points .
that is very important .
it was not .
that is not on , believe me !
i would say quite clearly once again : we in parliament cannot simply make demands .
and the union must play its part .
but then we must consider certain things with regard to animals , and also with regard to human health .
and we need to do this throughout the world .
our position is very clear .
i should like to thank the committee for this .
we cannot stop now .
but that is not enough .
what is to be done ?
we have already heard a great deal of talk about how to achieve this .
the most important thing is the health of the european public .
'
that point has not yet been made today .
i now expect that action will be taken quickly , and that the intergovernmental conference will be used to discuss with the member states the necessary reforms of the institutions .
i see that as extremely positive .
why were they there ?
i hope that this community will take note of what i have said .
i do not think any further comment is needed on my part .
let me mention some of the principles which i regard as crucial for the future .
what do i mean by that ?
i should like to point out that some important initiatives have also been taken here by the commission .
i do agree with one thing , however : we need much more transparency .
and i am able to say with confidence that the commission will continue to do its job , in the interest of europe 's citizens .
i share that concern .
what comments does the commissioner have on the french authorities ' approach ?
the commission is aware of the matter raised by the honourable member .
mr president , i too was very pleased with the commissioner 's answer .
perhaps law is not the best example because of the different legal systems .
i agree with the commissioner that this is a matter of principle for the free internal market .
but sometimes reality is in conflict with principles .
we are all , i think , in favour of transparency .
is it possible to take over another member 's question .
no ?
very well .
but i am sure he would understand my concern when he says he will comment when reports become available .
have they actually done so ?
can he tell us that ?
i do not understand the commissioner when he says that this has nothing to do with our common interest .
but that is entirely up to the initiative of the member state .
if so , how should the two governments concerned act upon that ?
we are currently working on this issue .
thank you , mr president , and thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
what has happened to it , and what does the commission plan to do next on this subject ?
consumers understand why some of them are there , but in the case of others they do not understand at all .
that is the situation , and we cannot change it .
i do not know what to do .
the commissioner 's answer says this is all too difficult .
it is really no good for the commissioner simply to hand this question back to me and say he does not know what to do , that it is all too difficult .
we are trying to do that .
this is a welcome change . under the proposal it will be for each member state to decide what , if any , form the support will take .
in conclusion , we congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
why is this ?
this must change in the future .
i agree with most of what my colleagues have said .
how this is done , is also of importance .
the debate is closed .
i have to say that we are extremely pleased .
thanks to you , the council adopted many of parliament 's amendments at second reading .
this was obviously necessary .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
only the president can find that out !
madam president , if i may , i would like to make two small comments on the minutes .
we are now dealing with comments on the minutes .
who took that decision ?
( parliament approved the minutes . )
item i - human rights :
madam president , on the subject of human rights .
the next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the following reports :
thank you very much .
today we no longer have a local market for food . nor do we have a national market for food .
the system has to work .
to my mind , ladies and gentlemen , that is quite fundamental .
we hope that the commission will accept these amendments we have proposed .
today we are taking appropriate measures to meet some of those concerns .
so , this measure is important for all these reasons .
i have to express the concerns of the committee on budgetary control in the area of cost .
there is , however , a problem madam president .
madam president , the proposals we are today discussing are , in my view , very important .
so we are well on our way .
they must take the interests and needs of the citizens of europe very seriously .
for that reason i have to ask what the cost of this proposed regulation will be .
on the other hand , is the focus of the monitoring right ?
is it not here that more resources are needed ?
the matter is urgent .
things are not as they were .
what is cost here ?
the same is true of information .
so our proposal goes further than the amendments in this respect .
as you know , i take the view that we should reach a decision as soon as possible .
we take the view that such data should be made available quickly .
parliament and the commission are in agreement on that point .
in the end , nothing .
that is all .
the second question , commissioner , concerns products .
i did not hear , or did not understand your answer .
i thank the commissioner .
the debate is closed .
welcome
that is not our wish , nor is it the wish of the council .
the council has given a commitment .
we can do that at any time .
that is the problem .
it has taken a long time ; that is true .
i would now like to talk about the second part of the proposal , which is much more serious .
but at the moment we do not have the guarantee that parliament would be allowed to give an opinion on something which it has already given its opinion on because there is only one reading and one regulation .
it can be done after the parliament has taken its position .
if you would agree to that , i think that would be the best solution .
welcome
before we take a vote on this issue , we want to be sure what the true position of the commission is .
before we move to the vote , we want to be clear about the commission position !
( applause )
now is not the time to debate this subject .
questions can be asked when we get to the report .
i have just said that such questions must be put at the appropriate time .
we were in very particular circumstances .
that , mr president , is all i wanted to say .
i will therefore not return to the matter .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , i would like to mention three points :
( applause )
i therefore believe that we can come back in the context of the second reading to the wish expressed by the rapporteur .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
let us all be very clear .
there is no doubt about that .
we have therefore voted against this joint resolution .
what is the current situation ?
how can we get out of this ?
the institutions of the european union and member state governments must now work together to protect consumer interests at all times .
there are two reasons for this position .
that is our basic reason for not voting on the joint resolution .
and it is high time we had greater transparency and more rights for the european parliament .
and of course we need a completely different european agricultural policy .
who are the victims ?
it should take full responsibility for it .
the same can be said of the group of member states in the european council which supported the measure .
for the future of the european union it is important to draw the institutional consequences .
in this context , i can only agree with the commission 's draft regulations , for two reasons .
unfortunately , this is not the case .
it is necessary , but not enough !
it was needed !
this is a necessary stage .
there will be no europe without a social europe !
quite rightly !
under the circumstances i shall vote in favour .
if this is considered necessary in current circumstances then we must accept it .
but , in this case , the free market must develop new regulations and support systems .
what is the commission doing ?
why do i make a point of saying that ?
i refer to the green paper on food .
can we perhaps have an answer on this ?
perhaps we might see a list of proposed measures here too ?
thank you . i look forward to the commissioner 's response .
finally , we agree with all the points .
as consumers we need something better than this .
the three areas which i would focus on particularly are safety , information and help to consumers .
it then goes on to say that it is not going to do anything about it .
that is essential .
at the moment , very little .
the european commission will benefit by it .
that is what is needed .
we think that it could be used more often .
if you think that he has done so , why did you not say so ?
the debate should therefore be put back into context .
secondly , in view of what i said this morning , when will she be able to bring forward the green paper on food policies ?
we know the pressure she has to fight against within the commission .
so you have simply to decide when you ask for a document what you really want .
the debate is closed .
green paper on financial services
and the list goes on .
one : the internal market is not really working .
that is unacceptable .
that is what we call for in this debate today .
that is what this legislation should address .
and we have done just that .
that communication will , of course , take account of the opinion of this house .
can he tell us a little more ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
you also said that reforms have taken place .
we must therefore consider the situation as it really is and be absolutely clear about the fact that it is high time to consider the basic principles of peace here .
we say it again and again .
we must apply quite different principles , and that is the purpose of our resolution .
why do we have to go through it again now ?
in the face of this situation , how can the european parliament play a positive role ?
so my group will not vote in favour of this resolution .
that is our problem .
why am i saying this ?
i do not know .
i am not sure .
what will it lead to ?
nothing .
what should we do now ?
let us at least agree on that .
that is not the position yet .
we must therefore show them our solidarity and give them our support .
what is needed is effective policy , no more , no less .
we need to help .
efforts must be made in that direction .
it is possible and it will be effective .
that is the kind of action we need .
mr president of the council , the motion for a resolution the european parliament is going to adopt also makes positive points which need to be taken into account .
let us do so .
thank you very much , mr president-in-office .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
that is not much , mr president-in-office of the council , but at least it is a start .
take my own country , for example .
i thank the president-in-office for his reply .
it does not apply to the present .
would it mean that they had to apply eu law in full in the relevant field ?
concerning your second question about the case law of the european court of justice .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
is the council aware of this problem ?
thank you for the response from the minister responsible .
mr president , i thank the president-in-office for his answer .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
does that objective form part of the eu 's initiatives for the region ?
mr president , i want to thank the president-in-office for his answer .
in no case would i wish for any kind of military solution .
i thank the council for that reply and for the efforts it has made in the past .
i shall think about whether a little more pressure might be appropriate .
that is what the people themselves want , let alone the governments involved .
it is not my place to go into those further or comment on them .
thank you for that response .
i hope you can answer this .
i would like to thank the council for their answer .
this is why i think that demand is the most important issue , and most important of all is to ensure that young people do not begin using drugs at all .
this is not an area in which the european union has any powers .
it is for the european commission to take further action here .
thank you very much , mr president-in-office .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the committee and my group take the view that such a european directive at the present time is something that they cannot agree to .
in that connection , i wish to clear up three specific issues .
the joint debate is closed .
this is how we create freedom of movement for our citizens .
with this in mind , a number of amendments have been tabled .
we shall be discussing these amendments and taking decisions on them , and we expect the commission to go along with parliament .
i say , better this little step than nothing .
there are two gentlemen here , but so far they have not said anything on this subject .
the debate is closed .
four political groups have supported the amendment proposals , some were supported by five .
nothing at all really .
ladies and gentlemen , in three years time we will be in the year 2000 .
ladies and gentlemen , look around you at the reality outside our institutions .
this has applied to member states but more particularly to countries outside the eu .
i believe that in our open society it is time we put an end to this .
mr president , i have five points to make .
not in every case then , but in some specific cases .
it is one thing to encourage and quite another to take circumstances into account .
for this reason i hope that the group 's common proposal will be accepted .
i support the proposals that have been presented .
it is more of an opportunity .
in so far as i am concerned , i do not want such a society .
what happened ?
the first is of a legal nature .
what should we do ?
this is why we wish to keep to the commission 's text .
mr president , i welcome the rapporteur 's report .
that is just not going to happen .
i must stress that what we are talking about here is the work experience .
that does not apply in the european institutions .
not here .
i have two clear questions for the commissioner .
the european commission does nothing about it .
do they seriously believe that that is what we want , that we do not want to carry on being ourselves ?
really that cannot be true !
the proposal has two objectives .
but this is a matter which should be considered case by case .
all in all , i should like to say that , on many points , i agree with parliament 's amendments .
it might be a good idea to discuss this with the committee .
let us now see the commissioner doing something , and let him at least give me an answer to my questions .
the commission needs to think about this .
thank you , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i have a comment on the minutes .
( the minutes of the previous sitting were approved )
that is all the comments i have to make .
this will create much greater transparency , and that is what we need .
that is why amendment no 10 is so important .
i do not see that at all .
we must try to find the best solution here .
there is a risk that we will take resources away from necessary future developments .
i have expressed a certain amount of concern in my statement from the legal committee which has not been included by the economic committee .
but how are we to achieve that ?
however , that is not our subject today .
i have always made that point .
of course , it will happen in some cases .
that goes without saying .
and then you can reduce costs as well .
but that is not what matters .
that is the first point .
so that motion for an amendment can be accepted .
we talk about unemployment in the european union .
why ?
a final word on the wto question .
but , as this is the first reading , i may then give a full report to the rapporteur .
that is how things stand today .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
the commissioner has already referred to this .
there are of course other points of concern in this directive .
he is absolutely right .
i congratulate my colleagues .
on the one hand we must meet the needs of an open market , and on the other we know that there is a very special need of regulation here .
once again , many thanks for everything that has been achieved .
i believe a good start has been made .
now to the reports .
we too support both reports and congratulate our colleagues .
but that is not what we are doing .
even so , that is how we are going to have to do it , given the time pressure that has been put on us .
even so , we are going to vote in favour now .
i think this is an excellent idea .
even so , i will see what view the council takes of the six amendments which you have tabled and which we all support .
and that is completely wrong !
well , nothing wrong with that !
i would like to make that point now , in justice to the council and the member states .
thank you very much .
i did not actually want to continue the debate .
the joint debate is closed .
no one will have any doubt which is the side of law , freedom and democracy .
i believe that the voting procedure should be made absolutely clear , so that all of us really are certain about what point we are voting on .
it is a crucial amendment and i hope colleagues here will vote for it .
then people really will be clear what they are being asked to vote on .
( parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution )
so the council will not be taking any final decision .
( parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution )
before the final vote on the report
amendments have been tabled by some political groups .
( parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution )
this is very important !
that is why i support them , and i congratulate the rapporteur .
the problem is , quite simply , one of justice .
this is why i have voted against this report .
thank you for giving us that opportunity .
mr president , i do not think the point is whether the council should be here .
welcome
this is a difficult position to be in .
i agree with this view .
had it been possible to direct the vote of no confidence towards the british government or the previous commission , i would have voted in favour of it .
as it is , i have not done so .
there is no need for an in between stage .
i approved of it , and i voted for it .
that is why i shall be voting in favour .
that is serious .
and it should not take too long .
the european public would not understand it if the european parliament were to do nothing .
there is an urgent need to create them in the intergovernmental conference .
it may even be true to say that not everything that could have been done was done , but many things were set in motion and the first results are already being seen .
why ?
in a system like that , anything can happen .
next week the council must decide on a common approach to an international force .
we can see how wrong that is .
i had two reasons .
it is now time to see if we mean it seriously .
we should help to find a political solution .
what form might that solution take ?
we must support the un 's initiatives .
the first thing we can do to help is to look at the situation in our own countries .
that is a major contribution to peace .
but now for the subject of today 's motion .
you are doing something that needs to be done .
the debate is closed .
the union must be prepared to offer its help here .
obviously , those responsible must be called to account .
a system was in play .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
next week 's council meeting will take the decision .
the list is a long one .
this is an area in which the united nations must now take action .
this is a very important subject .
i cannot understand this at all .
this is very important indeed .
i ask the commission to take this forward with our support to the united nations .
it is not and was not .
it is our concern .
however , that is in the past .
what did he do ?
i have had a meeting with him .
i should also like to know what view the commission takes of this matter .
i shall answer all the questions in the order in which they were asked .
what matters , i believe , is the result .
i believe this draft resolution is supported by a majority of the member states of the european union .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
we have one at the moment , for the euro .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
if that is not an example of a need to work together at a european level , i do not know what is .
i shall mention just four .
as a first example , take france .
as a second example , take germany .
but we are not united about the means .
every european country is trying a different approach .
our french colleagues are responsible .
that for me is the most important thing about this parliament .
if you want to know what this debate is really about , ladies and gentlemen , you will find it there .
i really feel i have to say that .
that 's what i asked you , and i would like an answer .
but the other side , the development policy side , is important too .
the debate is closed .
development cooperation policy
i wish to thank the new president for this .
coordination is just not working .
in the time available to me i will address just three .
but it does not work .
the members states do not .
are they just going to stand alone or are we actually going to see some action on them ?
where , madam president , are the major problems ?
and we all know which countries that applies to .
this is absolutely essential .
i hope that these policy guidelines will be set in this parliament .
let me start by making two points .
secondly , there is no such thing as a european development policy .
that is the real situation .
it is not even on the agenda yet .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
various issues are involved here , but i shall discuss just four of them , the first being the need for coordination .
an amendment to that effect is being tabled .
but i think there is social pressure behind this and that is a good thing : social pressure from the people of europe , who really want to help .
so negotiations are all very well , but they are not a final answer .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
madam president , i refer to the minutes .
are there any other comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
we shall not do so this year .
they are two different proposals at two different times .
i am sure parliament and the commission can come to some agreement on what is the best way forward .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
why is this ?
but where should we start ?
i would therefore ask that this report be approved
ladies and gentlemen , i believe that we should continue the discussion .
to the report .
we congratulate the rapporteur on doing so in this report .
there is no such thing .
the commission is aware of those problems .
thank you very much .
the debate is closed .
the vote will now be taken .
before the vote on amendment no 4
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is not just about trade .
( applause )
mr president , i should like to ask the commissioner a question about what he has just said .
well , it will not do !
the council of ministers did not follow this up and it has not approved the common position , as it is so far away from the commission 's position .
what does the commission really want ?
he said that if we had put it through we would have had serious problems in the field of economic relations and trade interests .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the vote will now be taken .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is what i have done .
mr president , on a point of order .
communication and statement by the president
( applause )
i thank you for this statement .
are there any comments ?
i shall not comment on that .
( applause from the are group )
if you have heard of any such developments , i hope you will let us know .
my question is this : what was the point of the procedure ?
that is the first thing i want to ask . secondly , how much did the procedure cost ?
( applause )
( the minutes were approved )
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
are there any comments ?
( the order of business was adopted )
i put the green group 's request to the vote .
this is a second reading .
( parliament agreed to the request )
but that has not happened yet .
do we want a europe of governments or a europe of citizens ?
let 's take one example .
overall , therefore , we are in favour of this process and we want to see it continue .
we might discuss that , but in principle we should be in agreement .
so to move forward , but how ?
this would also increase the level of control for the people .
but i do not share all your concerns , as i shall make clear in a moment .
here too , i share your views .
the debate is closed .
the information society
there is to be a framework directive .
the debate is closed .
i look forward to the view of the commission on our proposals .
as mentioned by the rapporteur , a basic education is not enough .
we also agree on the objectives .
my second point concerns women .
that was not the case until recently .
the debate is closed .
we can support most of the other amendments of the commission .
i cannot understand this approach .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i would like to point out that i was present yesterday .
but that applies to most members .
mr president , i was present too but am not on the list .
mr president , i have a proposal to make .
mr president , i was present .
( parliament approved the minutes )
( parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
so we support the commission line in this regard .
we must ban that too .
yet nothing happened .
but we must have one in future .
and that is just what we are discussing today .
nature does it by itself .
it is our task to establish that .
it has been said here that it should deal with the question .
then it is to stop for six months , after which it will be set up again .
i do not think we can allow ourselves that at this stage .
governments , or the private sector ?
the technology is important .
there is no question about that .
we need to know all these things .
of course there are .
it is not .
this is not at all a research problem .
there are indeed scientific issues on the one hand and issues of democracy on the other .
but if we are to do so we must first reach agreement among ourselves .
that is one measure to be taken by each of our member states .
the debate is closed .
i understand this .
i have two basic points to make here .
the creation of a european social model and a european social area is as important as social dialogue .
what did it do with them ?
that must never be allowed to happen again .
what approach should we take ?
what is needed here is economic action .
but there is more to it than that .
there is much talk of a social europe , but which europe are we talking about ?
but could the union be doing more ?
be that as it may , it is absolutely clear that workers must be given the same protection , no matter which member state they are in .
this is not a new situation .
so what do we now expect of the commission ?
two things .
the first is short term .
there are means of pressure .
but others , of course , must also play their part .
i believe that the intergovernmental conference will provide an opportunity to do just that .
let us be clear about that .
we would look forward to a better response in future from those who have responsibility in this regard .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
it is an excellent initiative but it needs more resources and more support .
let me make a few comments in this regard .
i shall have something to say on that in a moment .
finally , reference has been made to the need to step up activities in the field of research and development .
rightly so !
mr president , i do not want to start a debate but only say that this parliament decided to take that position because a serious parliament must have the time to do its work .
we did have various discussions to try to reach a joint position between our two groups .
i hope the commission will take account of our position .
i have voted for the report .
these are matters which we and our party back home are clear on and we cannot go along with them .
we cannot vote for this report .
this we believe is good .
we cannot support this report .
in our view , the only thing that remains to be done is to get the most out of existing measures .
for this reason , we are voting against the report .
for the people , however , what is most important is direct action in the field , to achieve results that will improve internal security .
our final vote against the report must be seen in this light .
we are voting for the report .
i am voting for the report .
we must also continue with our efforts to improve safety .
all this is important .
thank you madam president .
that is to say , it is a small step but certainly does not mean that we and the commission can stop there .
not a word on the question of labour costs .
i , therefore , would ask and request that this house support amendment no 4 .
i think this is important for europe .
let me give you an example .
i think the answer would be no .
i look to the commission for initiatives in this sector .
madam president , there are two things i would like to stress .
this is an example of how regional interests come into conflict with one another .
we have had many of those .
but we have a problem of what to say to the people of europe .
that has to be wrong .
the answer is no , and i think it is time for a different policy .
that is one possibility .
that will not work .
the commission has no problem with all the additional proposals in this area .
of course there is no sense in that .
the same applies in the council .
i do not understand that .
so we had some success with that .
at this point i no longer believe they will do so .
that no longer has anything to do with a market economy .
and we will do so .
we have to do this .
the commission always does that !
sometimes not !
the debate is closed .
the information society , culture and education
but then what ?
some members have asked : ' why the year 2000 , why not 1999 or 2001 ?
for that reason i hope everyone will support these amendments .
that is the kind of level of education we are talking about .
but these are opportunities that a free market will not provide .
i support the call on the commission to come forward with a green paper .
the rapporteur has presented an excellent report . i congratulate her .
this is a vital issue for europe .
information technology is only a support .
i very much doubt it .
you must not say that this is just another document .
let me just make two or three other comments on more general questions that have come up again .
so once again my thanks to the rapporteur .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
statement by the president
i should like to stress two things :
that is the purpose of the amendments for which our group will vote .
let me refer to two points .
and that is a good thing .
that is why i consider two amendments tabled by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection most important .
once concerns information to the public .
in this area , public information is the real guarantee of safety .
that is one demand .
that is the second major amendment we tabled .
thank you mr president .
i very much hope that the commission is able to accept it .
according to the directive it should have presented it last year .
i myself hope that this matter will be put to rights by new treaty amendments .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , unfortunately i have to put another question .
i would like your position on that too .
i do not think there are problems as regards transparency and public information in connection with the agreement in place .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
but i will certainly draw the attention of those in the commission dealing with these matters to the points raised .
subject : european legislation
what action is the commission currently taking to bring this about ?
there is a concern within the eu about free competition in this market .
do the members of the commission share this view ?
this provided a legal solution to the problem .
commissioner , thank you very much for your answer , but i would like to put a practical question .
thank you , mr commissioner .
now there are 20 000 .
i hope that it is clear what i wanted to ask about , now that time is so short .
i am prepared to return to this matter later .
thank you , mr commissioner .
subject : 1998 budget and the structural funds
thank you , mr commissioner .
question time ( council )
i would like to thank you for the opportunity of being here with you today .
i would ask the president to bring this back to the council if possible .
mr president-in-office of the council , thank you for the information you have given us .
we see that there is still some doubt , but there is still hope from the commissioner 's words .
if not , why not ?
could you perhaps comment on this ?
we are aware of the situation .
is the council aware of such demands by the commission ?
the most important question is on the other hand what is to be done to reduce unemployment in europe .
reality is more important than any principle .
i think that if you want a serious discussion on this we must approach it in a serious way .
i would add that account will be taken of the results of that conference .
thank you , mr president-in-office , for your answer .
i agree with most of what you said , and am very pleased to do so .
subject : the eu 's foreign and security policy
i do understand that the members of the council cannot say at the present time what will come out of the intergovernmental conference .
very little has happened in terms of implementation .
i would just like to say a few words here .
we need a majority decision to deal with questions concerning internal security .
i want to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
i cannot comment on it .
subject : enlargement and internal security
the conclusions will be presented to the council in may .
we must keep that in mind .
on the other hand , we in the council , commission and parliament are currently working on a new proposal for a regulation on technical measures .
i believe this is a fundamental point we must keep to .
mr president , the key word in this question is ' balance ' .
what i want to say is that we should try to find a solution .
thank you , mr president .
something must therefore be done .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the agreement was already reached so that no aspect of it could be called into question .
so we should not rule out that aspect at all .
these agreements are important . we take them seriously in parliament .
we have to ask ourselves why that is the case .
i have to stress this .
the joint debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
on what authority ?
on his own behalf .
as a member .
not another word on the matter .
( applause )
mr president , the same applies to me .
the next item is the joint debate on :
how is it done ?
that is the most important practical objective .
however , it is difficult to make a proposal of this kind that would take account of the particular situation involved in every single case .
thank you , commissioner .
we now need the political will to carry them through .
this will have to be taken up again in the budget discussions .
as you know , several initiatives have been taken .
this is a very important instrument that we need .
( applause )
like mrs green , i do not think there can be a better example of what this european parliament is here for .
that is the only solution we can see for the future .
we need to do what can be done already .
have we asked the questions that need to be asked ?
no !
so did we do that ?
no , we did not !
in point of fact , we had to fight to get it on the agenda at all !
that is the problem .
how could this have happened ?
the statement you have just made will be included in the minutes .
which part does she accept ?
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i consider it important that this is clear before we vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
thank you very much , mrs green .
ladies and gentlemen , the debate on this matter has already taken place , so we will move to the vote .
before the vote
he may speak after the vote .
mr president , as we all should , i fully respect your authority .
i want to make that absolutely clear .
so let us now vote on this resolution .
mr president , what happened just now is completely unacceptable . this is not a trade union meeting , this is a parliament !
we were in the process of voting .
you should not have allowed mrs green the floor .
let 's get on with our job !
let 's vote !
let 's vote !
some may vote one way , others the other .
that is our political responsibility .
that is called democracy .
that is a very specific question .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
in doing what you did , mr president , you did no service to this house .
well , you should not have given the floor to mrs green because we were voting .
mrs green made a political speech .
all .
and that was what you did not do .
it was nothing other than that .
i do not agree .
there is no specific information on how these resources are to be used .
the consequences are :
i voted against the motion .
however , the resolution from the european parliament takes the matter even further .
the eu has over a long period of time given priority to matters relating to the economy , trade , markets and competition .
we shall then take note of it , but we shall not have any further discussion on that point now !
we now have this report . i think the real work is only now beginning .
it seems to be the case again this time too .
so far , this has not been the case .
new technology is a must .
it is time for the european union and member states to act .
it must also be applied in an effective way .
and in the context of jobs and the labour market that is the last thing we want .
many honourable members have already mentioned this .
something has to be done about this .
here too the commission will have to make appropriate proposals .
i can now say to the president they have indeed been successful .
but further work needs to be done .
i believe we must look at things as they are .
the same goes for any proposals which the committee may wish to make .
the debate is closed .
the government cannot do so .
what must happen now ?
but it would take too long to go into all this again .
i believe that today parliament has something to say to the council and the commission .
we believe these three points are fundamental .
i think the commission 's actions have also been positive .
the problem is indeed a political one .
madam president , in my view the compromise reached is , at this point , the only instrument that could put an end to the violence .
the government has allowed this to happen .
both these countries could become involved .
this must not happen .
we hope to see action upon these things .
and that is not all .
that seems to me one of the last priorities which we in europe should have .
the debate is closed .
welcome
we welcome them .
welcome , ladies and gentlemen !
( applause )
that will not change in the future either .
ladies and gentlemen , i look forward to the debate on my report and thank you for your attention .
i am concerned about an economic aspect .
we must therefore have joint projects in economic development , research , energy programmes and environmental protection .
sometimes power comes with money , but not always .
i hope that this will change .
thank you , mr president , ladies and gentlemen .
much remains to be done .
that is already a step forward .
much remains to be done .
the debate is closed .
progress of the intergovernmental conference
we need only think of two fundamental issues , such as enlargement and monetary union .
parliament is concerned about this .
but is this possible without any real integration of the important areas of home affairs and justice ?
obviously not !
how so ?
on the third question , our position is very clear .
the proposal for this cooperation , to be put to a vote by the member states , should come from the commission .
mr president , this is a crucial time , as the commissioner has said .
ladies and gentlemen , are we finally going to give europe the means to follow a third road - the road of employment and social justice ?
but the council would be wrong to think that that would be enough .
we will continue to fight for that .
we want it , but at this time i do not know how much we can hope for it .
that is one point .
the second is this : i expect the commission to adopt a more positive approach .
how can things go on like this ?
this would be even more important , with the single currency upon us .
does that cost too much as well ?
not only foreign policy , but internal security and environment policy as well .
and then there is the fight against international crime .
what would he say today if he had to make a statement about the intergovernmental conference ?
why ?
and why is the european parliament not to be allowed a say ?
thank you , mr president .
you know the commission 's position .
i do not entirely agree .
i think that is essential .
i have not had an answer to it and i would like one .
this is an open question .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
budget guidelines for 1998
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we expect the commission to bring forward appropriate proposals to this effect in time for the first reading .
i would ask you to support the guidelines when we vote tomorrow .
mr president , the guidelines motion for the 1998 budgetary procedure for the other institutions is very clear .
i now turn to the part of the report dealing with information technology and information policy .
so there are very clear guidelines there .
my second point is on energy .
i say that because when you see our amendment to paragraph 3 you will understand our concerns .
secondly , when it comes to specific priorities , the guidelines are extremely clear .
they give four priority areas .
the subject is an important one .
secondly , 1998 is very important because it will show whether or not budgetary powers which actually exist will be taken away .
finally , agriculture remains important .
in fact we must encourage this policy and make it work .
i have tabled an amendment on that too , which i hope will be adopted .
unfortunately , the structural funds do not create jobs .
they move jobs .
what happened ?
in a word , the structural funds do not create jobs - at the most , they move them .
that is no way to improve the situation in europe .
thus the fight against unemployment must be seen to be a particularly central task for the eu as a whole .
these are important .
nevertheless , for the moment it must remain .
that is quite high in the current circumstances .
thank you , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
what , then , are the central concerns of the report and of the committee on development and cooperation ?
the council accepted a good deal of the report at first reading .
after parliament 's first reading , the council accepted some of the approved amendments .
we are actually going to try and help the developing countries !
what are we doing ?
are we serious ?
i have no more to say .
thank you , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
population policies in developing countries
that being so , not everything has been said , and not everything will be said at voting time , and of course we will have to have a budgetary strategy for monitoring this matter .
mr president , population growth is a problem for the development of many countries .
i think it is right that the european union should offer that information and practical help .
therefore , i would ask once again for your support on this point .
it remains to be seen how the house will vote .
the debate is closed .
so the money is there .
the main priority of the european union is jobs .
we have problems in society which research and development will also help with .
so far , that is not what we are talking about here .
in fact , the commission did not find anything .
so i call upon the commission , here and now , to support parliament .
it has thus adopted an essential amendment from the european parliament 's first reading .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i was not the only member to speak at that particular stage of the day , but i did put a very specific question .
am i going to get a reply ?
if so , when ?
i cannot give you an answer at this time .
i hope that it is not true !
i would request a reply . when do you think that reply might be ?
thank you , mr president .
what should be done in such cases ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
in this context too , the agreement is extremely important .
of course there have been positive developments and there have been problems .
this country needs our help .
and , naturally , it has no wish to do so .
the subject of my opinion was the effects on the european budget of this agreement .
quite obviously a country in that economic situation is not going to be in a position to do very much trade .
we are doing our best .
and for the time being , they remain closed .
all these countries need the aid and attention of the european union .
we need to go further .
the same applies to changes in the democratic area .
and what is that ?
we must therefore also think of these two states in political terms .
mr president , thank you for giving me the floor .
he was responsible for the comments that honourable members have heard .
the debate is closed .
welcome
( applause )
however , we shall now vote on the report .
' .
that is all .
amendment no 11 :
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the final vote :
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i consider this unacceptable .
mr president , i have two points to make .
in order to try and make some changes , i have proposed three amendments which i will naturally vote for .
however , i am not sure if we should give more money for research .
i have voted against , because no new legal framework is required .
it is only through education and further training in the use of information technology that everyone can have equal access to the information society .
the commission cannot make use of it and cannot really control it .
the problem of water in this region is one of fundamental importance .
here again , everything still remains to be done .
a ' before ' and an ' after ' .
we must pay close attention to how we have to go about things !
it is important for the measures to balance community protection and free trade with third countries .
our basic view is that the european union should be a cooperation between independent states .
for us development in this direction is unacceptable .
we are therefore voting against the proposal .
how can this be done ?
but what do we actually find ?
welcome
we cannot simply say that we have discussed it often enough , so we should not need to do so again .
we need to do it every time , unfortunately .
why ?
i think this is a particularly urgent matter .
so we feel that we should back this new approach and hope that it will really come about .
this problem has been discussed often enough , but little has been done about it .
that is no reason to stop discussing it .
that is what this resolution will achieve .
the debate is closed .
madam president , the peace process still has a long way to go .
that is a very serious development .
i hope parliament , therefore , can support the resolution when we come forward .
thank you , commissioner . the debate is closed .
kosovo
but can we expect a situation like that to last for long ?
madam president , since we are talking about kosovo , i would like to make a few things clear .
it will therefore also have the support of my group .
but the resolution will certainly have our support .
women 's rights in the world
madam president , a good many points have already been made here with which i entirely agree .
this is just point 1 of our motion for a resolution .
although i did not vote for it , i did want to believe in it .
i believe the role of women is very important .
the subject should have come earlier on the agenda .
the solution has been a positive one .
the debate is closed .
that 's just one example among many .
the debate is closed .
it goes without saying that we fully support the aid to be provided there by the union .
it is important , very important , that this text should be approved , in the end and despite everything .
i hope that it will be the beginning of a new position in the future , where the people themselves are more important than other issues .
and yet there is no proposal on this !
this is not , therefore , a problem of financial resources - the financial resources exist - but simply one of whether or not it is possible to work out in the field .
the debate is closed .
did you have something further to say , commissioner ?
we really should not be voting on those three words .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
welcome
all things considered , i decided to vote against this report .
this situation has to change , and i am pleased to say that we agree on that here in the house .
we must therefore act as a positive role model , and more should be done in this respect .
this is an excellent report and a good example of how these questions can be raised .
this is an excellent report .
we are in agreement with some significant aspects of her report .
this , for us , is a fundamental aspect .
that point has already been made .
of course , the same also applies to the member states .
now we can see the reality .
this is a call we have to address to all governments .
the commission has given us no information on this aspect .
the debate is closed .
this is just not acceptable .
i would like to ask the commissioner what the situation is in the council .
but that does not mean that it is not important .
also , i believe the decision is an important one because it is the first of its kind in the european union 's policy .
thank you , mr president .
two final points .
the reason for this ?
but i hope that we will indeed be able to make it .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
thank you for this information .
madam president , on a point of order .
can the commission look at this point and come back to us ?
to achieve that end , a number of measures are proposed .
that , madam president , is what i wanted to say about this report .
fundamental changes are needed .
but there are many others .
however , the commission has not said anything different .
i should like to thank you for the debate that we have had here today .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we have already given them much too much .
the debate is closed .
the rules of procedure do not allow it .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
it is important that the community should be involved in this .
i believe that this should be included in agreements of this kind .
the question is , what will the commission do with it ?
the debate is closed .
mr president , on a point of order .
the question now is what to do about it .
old europe will be full of old people .
education has already been mentioned .
this is where most of the population is found and these are the people who will need to take part in the development of new technology .
society must also play a part .
in any case , let us know how to make the most of the little that we have achieved .
or has it ?
so what are the member states doing ?
firstly - and many people have mentioned this - is the whole question of the number of women at work , and this will obviously now be increased .
it is therefore important that we should concern ourselves with this subject .
we can meet outside too , if you so wish .
we are coming to the end of a long week .
we have to think about this .
however , it seems to me that this is not enough .
what should society as a whole be doing ?
why not ?
we said this at the time !
take this discussion about employment , or work .
why should we not accept that people live as they want to live .
i should like to hear him say that .
the commission is able to accept the proposals .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
and it is essential that we should prevent that .
this is not made clear enough in the report .
mr president , on a point of order .
are there any comments ?
and why ?
not a serious crime .
( the minutes were approved )
but they are not doing so !
order of business
therefore we should give ourselves time to deal with this issue .
it is for this reason that no one in this house can vote against this request .
it is better like that as we can take any points into consideration .
i think this would be wrong .
( parliament approved the proposal )
that decision will , therefore , be an extremely important one .
unfortunately , almost no progress has been made at all .
she has been very kind to the commission and i understand why .
firstly , may we know what draft measures are to be proposed to us ?
' draft measures ' could mean anything .
why not ?
where do they come from ?
if the commissioner does not know then who does ?
what is the point of having a european union position on this issue , which is very important to many people in europe , if we cannot do anything about it because of international rules ?
parliament is against the idea as well .
but what are they ?
we can make do with those that are available .
there are two more points i should make in reply to questions by honourable members .
do you take this view as well ?
i understand all too well what you are saying .
i did not say a decision had been made .
the debate is closed .
we do not think there is any guarantee of that at the moment .
and what of consumers in all this ?
let us be clear about things .
my question to the commission is : how can we put this right ?
thus the debate here today will be of value for this further work .
this directive does not deal with the health or environment aspects .
mr president , we must thank the commissioner for the information she has provided .
it is not true that we have all the safety necessary .
however , to date very little has been done to encourage investment in the research industry in europe .
it is quite clear that the european commission is responsible .
this is the fundamental question .
but there is research and research .
mr president , commissioner , a lot of things have been said , so let me first of all ask a question .
i would like to start with a more general comment .
this does not mean that we ourselves have no responsibility .
nor does it mean that we do not end up with a political decision , because we do in fact .
i believe this is what we have done .
we did take account of them .
the joint debate is closed .
unfortunately , this has not been the case .
mr president , i should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
i also hope - and i say this too on behalf of my group - that the amendments which have been tabled by the rapporteur and the social affairs committee can be accepted by the commission .
we are dealing with an extremely serious problem here .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
are there any other comments on the minutes ?
are there any other comments ?
are there any other comments on the minutes ?
( the minutes were adopted )
respect for human rights in the european union
this freedom alone is not enough .
of course , our states still have some way to go .
we cannot speak of human rights today without speaking of social rights .
no matter .
of course .
at the same time , it 's true , what can we hope for the future ?
i am not the only one to say so this morning .
this report really is in need of it .
you might think this goes without saying .
it no longer has that purpose .
i should like to give you an example .
it has a political agenda .
we must change that , if we wish the report to be taken seriously around the world .
i should like to propose a way out .
it clearly was not created with this in mind !
that is the public 's real concern .
the debate is closed .
however , today is a first .
there are a number of other amendments from the committee on budgets .
however , there is one technical point i should like to make .
the next question is the question of own resources .
the house would do better to draw up a report on that instead .
in general i welcome the statement he has made with respect to parliament 's opinion .
so i would ask him to look at this point again .
i do however take your point .
the debate is closed .
this requires greater action at community level .
it is high time for this to happen .
what about investment levels ?
we need to say more in the future about this issue .
now to the problems .
let me comment on some of the important points raised in this debate .
we share the concern expressed in the report on the need to pay special attention to the most serious social problem in the european union : unemployment .
the answer therefore has to be european .
we now come to voting time .
i cannot decide that a vote is not required .
on amendment no 3
an amendment no 3 has been tabled .
that amendment must be put to the vote as a whole .
on amendment no 15
( parliament adopted the resolution )
no .
but that is not the case here .
but that is not the point .
that is the end of voting time .
we know why this is .
the commission has no answer to this .
why ?
the second idea is the need for a common policy for growth .
the first concerns the reform of the labour market .
it is certainly needed to create new jobs , but it is not enough .
only then , perhaps , will the european union draw the conclusions that it should draw .
where did you find them ?
down to what point should we reduce them ?
where will it end ?
year after year you say the same things over and over again .
i cannot understand why this was not given due consideration .
first of all , growth .
why ?
i come now to my second point , that is growth supported by investment .
the employment market , first of all .
well , no , the commission does not share this point of view .
the debate is closed .
why ?
i do not think so .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there are two points i should like to make .
in other words , there is a price to pay .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and also the commission for its proposals .
i hope the commission would accept that as a positive development .
in other words , all we do is talk , not act .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
that is very true .
of course commissioner , i do not think so , as you know !
it is not , of course , a scientific or economic end in itself .
that can be a very great help .
germany has already been mentioned .
i sometimes think they are not , but that is something we can discuss .
the debate is closed .
but we do accept the common position which is under consideration now .
that amendment should be accepted .
to this extent , we welcome the council 's common position .
so far , so good .
i should like to thank the council for its common position , in which it takes over the amendments adopted by parliament at first reading and accepted by the commission .
and so it must remain !
then we can discuss it again .
then we would not get a result .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
there are also particular rules concerning particular products .
now we will be there as well .
i should like to ask the commissioner what actually happened at the meeting yesterday .
thank you commissioner .
i would also like to know why the environmental assessment will take place after the start of the project .
so i think we have a common purpose in this which will be achieved in a way acceptable to the honourable member .
this has , i know , been of great interest to the honourable member throughout .
does the commission plan further action in this respect ?
i do not agree with the last point .
thank you , commissioner , for that reply .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
subject : regional policy in ireland
i have a very specific question for the commissioner .
subject : structural funds policy after 1999
i thank the commissioner for her answer .
i have two questions .
however , the questions of whether , when and in what form this should take place must be discussed in the overall context of structural reform .
when and how does the commission propose to bring this aid to an end ?
i ask therefore : has the commission fully discussed the issue which we raised ?
if they are not , they should not be given any further aid .
i would also like to ask another question in this connection .
i believe , therefore , that we should stand by the agreed approach .
question time is closed .
the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights , for which i was the rapporteur , took the view that it made sense in principle to have such a directive .
we are in agreement with the rapporteur .
they cannot be allowed to stand outside the law .
and i would call on the commission , when it is making proposals in future , to ensure that the law applies to everyone .
however , i do not wish to go into that .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
unfortunately we have not been as successful as we set out to be .
i think not .
that is the question i would like to put to you .
the second point i would like to make is that we unfortunately had the wrong idea about the monitoring report .
i would say not .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
since the vote in the legal affairs committee , a number of further concerns have come to my attention .
that is not acceptable to the people of this european union .
we support you .
get on with it !
it therefore goes without saying that this proposed change cannot be accepted by the commission .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but we will try .
therefore , perhaps their word is to be taken at less than face value .
i think this is a very important point to make .
i would like to see the results of their work here .
then we could support this directive , but that is not the case today .
finally , i want to point out that the objective of the directive should be cultural as well as economic .
i will put the question which we will have to ask ourselves at some point : do we , or do we not , want a directive ?
i would draw the attention of both the commission and the house to the fact that three member state governments are clearly against the application of this directive .
this directive is a very important one .
what is actually the point at issue here ?
people cannot live on that .
i also think that the commission 's proposal is a very good one .
is that fair ?
mr president , i should first like to congratulate the rapporteur , who has done an excellent job as always .
no mention has been made of this .
nor does the commission mention it in its proposals .
that is what will happen !
mr president , i am speaking on behalf of the british european parliamentary labour party .
the debate is closed .
we have to note that much progress has been made in this whole area .
parliament has very real concerns about that .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes . )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we want to see parliament play a greater role within budgetary control matters .
i have a problem on this .
however , i am the rapporteur so , of course , i cannot say those things .
the reality is that very little , if anything , has happened in relation to that request .
a few words more on the main budget .
the european commission is trying in this way to get right on its side .
i would like to have an answer to this here .
this is a sector extremely important for tomorrow 's jobs , especially those of young people and women .
it is a priority for all of us .
we hope for the conclusion of the intergovernmental conference .
we hope for a positive conclusion , so that we can start discussing enlargement .
that is unacceptable !
economic management of expenditure is not enough .
furthermore , the report comes to the wrong conclusions .
they are very welcome but there are far too few of them .
secondly , i want to say a few words to the commission .
there are just two points i want to make .
there is another matter , though , that concerns me most of all - the need to take more account of own resources .
i want to reply to some of your comments .
on this question progress still needs to be made .
we are trying to go further in some other areas in the budget .
the debate is closed .
there are a number of things that i wish to say about this agreement .
it is not an agreement between the european union and one country , one state .
so i do not need to go into the content .
i would just like to mention two points .
so what is to be done ?
and europe ?
its political scope is obviously even more important than its economic and financial side .
that too is important in the context of the peace process .
but more is needed to get the peace process going again .
there can be no compromise on this point .
i ask everyone to think about that last point .
the next few days will be crucial .
but this is not enough .
i therefore support it .
the second thing is the peace process .
the third thing is coordination between the parties involved , europe and the united states .
nevertheless , there is a great deal that europe itself can do .
it is a very serious matter .
the debate is closed .
statement by the president
we congratulate them .
five of these have been included in the common position taken by the council .
the commission was prepared to accept the common position for two reasons .
mr president , we have an agreement with the commission and the council which should avoid us having to go to third reading .
the common position thus did not include these proposals by the european parliament .
that is why i voted in favour of the common decision agreed by the council .
many of the reports which are discussed here in parliament put the case for the creation of new institutions and organisations .
there are several reasons for this .
we think that these comments are far too general for us to be able to share these views in every respect .
secondly , the more political part : elections , human rights , greater democracy .
and then the monitoring of the situation .
a proposal on this must first be accepted in the council .
finally there is humanitarian aid .
and that applies too of course to implementation of the projects .
there have been enough words .
let us , at long last , do something to help european citizens .
we cannot do that !
i would add that it is also a major institutional crisis .
what has actually been done ?
gentlemen of the council and the commission , this parliament does not know the reasons why you do not want joint action .
it is in that context that we have to see our debate today .
but we did not .
clearly , that would not have been his wish in any other circumstances .
the debate is closed .
there are of course one or two areas of concern .
we must not allow this to happen .
there has to be respect for the rule of law .
i would agree with that .
you cannot have economic freedom without political freedom .
thank you mr president .
my interest is not just in business , it is in people .
but there is far more to be concerned about .
that is the key point .
i just have two further points .
in that sense i welcome the statement of the commission , although i am concerned about the comments of the council .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following four reports on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection :
that is the line taken in the reports before you today .
most of all , though , of course , we need them in the interests of our environment .
no , we have to do more , and we can do more .
question time ( council )
of course the social partners will also be involved in the discussions on employment .
i would like to thank the council for its answer .
the statement that employment policy at european level is not the only policy is absolutely true .
it is the individual member states .
subject : the cost of enlargement
i would like to thank the council for its answer .
i would like to hear the council 's views on this matter .
so in this specific case it is not the place of the council to state a view on it .
i thank the president-in-office for that reply .
subject : economic and social cohesion and unemployment
and that is and remains the objective .
it was one aspect of that .
in all other states a start has been made on the administrative and / or parliamentary procedures .
mr president-in-office , thank you for that reply .
i have to look at the existing legal position here .
that is a matter for the member states and the council cannot be called upon to comment .
i cannot play that part as president of the council .
would the council not agree with that ?
so these are political comments by people who are entirely independent .
it is not for the council to comment .
this is why i asked the question !
but this is not a matter for the institutions of the european union and i cannot give an answer as president of the council .
this programme has been going for some time .
the council is after all not a party to the intergovernmental conference and it is up to the governments and the commission too to put forward proposals for discussion at the intergovernmental conference .
i myself do not believe that .
then there really would be a conflict .
that is one thing i know for sure .
subject : european structural funds after 1999
the european union 's structural policy after 1999 is not currently an issue .
i accept everything he has said and i understand the reasons why he said what he said .
i think these are matters on which we can already act .
question time is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
and we propose that it be presented before 1998 .
we think such a legislative proposal should be put before this parliament .
a great deal has been said , and a great deal more remains to be said .
no mention has been made of those results , or of that task force .
thank you madam president .
a number of measures are required in order to achieve an acceptable environmental solution .
we have the policy instruments to do this - what we still need is the political will , both from the commission and the council .
that is not competition at all .
but there are technical reasons too .
i really do think it 's time to get to the point !
coming to the point , as i said , is important for the industry too .
we quite agree that this is a good thing for the environment .
those points have to be taken into account .
that must not be the aim of this parliament .
that is certainly not its objective .
it is my opinion that it is important to look at environmental issues as a whole .
therefore i cannot accept the amendments discussed in this context until we are some way down the road .
the debate is closed .
what are these three fundamental points ?
madam president , this particular proposal has taken up a great deal of various members ' time .
there was , in particular , one amendment , which my colleagues on the economic committee adopted .
first i would say that this an important directive .
i do not think that this is a good thing .
and i hope there will be a large vote in favour of this report .
these are transparency and access to information .
and now a word on procedure .
problems still remain .
so what have we actually been discussing here for the last ten years ?
i cannot understand this .
you have my total support for that .
there were quite a number of points made .
i have taken note of that .
i do not think that is the case .
we have the case law already in place .
we are making very considerable progress in this proposal .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes . )
and so to the four amendments .
the debate is closed .
thank you mr president .
i just think that parliament should know that .
why ?
a certain number of rules should therefore be adopted .
so they are a step in the right direction .
this can be done .
i would just like to ask the commission if this is true .
that was the purpose of the point of order i made at the beginning .
this says that they will have to take parliament seriously .
what are we doing here today ?
we accepted this in principle here last year .
they are the people who have a good idea of the situation and they must have a future in the industry .
thank you madam president .
it is true some regions of the community have better measures .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the commission would like parliament to give its opinion today .
madam president , on behalf of my group , i ask for this report to be referred back to committee .
i call the commissioner .
madam president , i simply wanted to say that i asked to speak before the vote , but the president did not allow me to do so .
the committee on fisheries supported the proposed regulation in principle .
i do not think that that is a good thing .
it is the best of the proposals now under discussion and i really hope that the commission can support the proposal .
the debate is closed .
)
may i ask for a vote on that ?
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we should therefore have voted on the amendment first .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it has been common practice for that not to happen .
we must act !
it is clear that these requirements have a price .
this is an example we should follow .
the principles on which environmental policy is based are accepted but not implemented .
urgent measures are required .
we support these two reports as they form an important part of the work in europe towards a better environment .
this is the way forward for the future as well .
this must change .
this proposed directive should have been referred to either the committee on social affairs , employment and the working environment or the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights .
i do not share this point of view .
where then does this problem come from ?
if we really want an effective and just europe , it is time to implement majority rule for all legislation .
in any case reality requires it .
we are voting against the joint resolution tabled by the six political groups .
freedom is for everyone .
that is really what is needed here .
that is what we should have been discussing .
it is necessary , therefore to put things back into context .
russia is on the road to democracy .
but russia is on the road to democracy , and we must support its progress along that road .
the negotiations are under way today .
there will be no problem , madam .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
what is the european union to do in this situation ?
is this new government legal or not ?
we know nothing about it .
it is not .
what is this about ?
there is no access !
it is a very serious issue .
at least that is what the european commission would like to see .
the joint debate is closed .
madam president , this is a small point of order .
it matters that the european union should take a stand on this subject .
i think that one cannot continue like this .
i should like to make some comments on the resolution .
that is something i would not wish upon the world or upon europe .
at the conference of governments , in which parliament would like to have more power , we have decided not to use the powers we do have .
that is one point .
the debate is closed .
it is very important that the european union should provide aid .
why ?
the debate is closed .
of course the european union has a considerable responsibility in this respect .
in my view , this is a very important matter in this connection .
the debate is closed .
we decided at the vote not to support the committee 's report .
all this is excellent .
why only 11 000 ?
what are these problems ?
you have called for more information and greater transparency at every level .
that is the view of the commission .
no , mr president , this is not a point of order .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , on a point of order .
this freedom does not actually exist .
as i said , i would like to thank the rapporteur for a good report .
so far , no new programme has been presented .
i should like to take up just a few points .
i would like to bring out three main points .
first of all the responsibility of the majority .
do you know why this should be ?
that is also very important .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
integration in developing countries
that is why development cooperation and regional integration must go hand in hand .
one final point .
because this will be the best way to achieve sustainable development in terms of the economy , employment and the environment .
developing countries are at a completely different stage in their economic development from the eu member states , and so a different approach is needed .
however , i should like to look at the issue more from the political point of view .
who is aware of it , even though it is of crucial economic importance ?
environmental consideration should form a key part of the overall strategy .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
there are various reasons for this ; we must be clear about how we are to approach them .
how will the situation develop ?
will it accept the commission decision ?
what is the commission doing about it ?
what measures is the commission taking ?
it is simply not fair .
i quite understand that something has to be done .
just think about it .
that is the main comment i have to make in this context .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
why ?
ladies and gentlemen , we shall not start a debate on the question .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
but it is important not to draw the wrong conclusions .
it is important that the eu takes the lead in this work and takes the necessary initiatives to bring about global free trade as soon as possible .
that is the only thing they have in common .
i take responsibility for that .
in that case i shall not put my question .
thank you very much for your cooperation .
there were different views on the subject in committee too .
i put the request for urgent procedure to the vote .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure ) this item will be included in tomorrow 's agenda .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am speaking on behalf of my group , on two of the amendments which are being presented on this text .
( applause from the are group )
mr president , i do not think we need to discuss these amendments or vote on them .
let me make the position of my group clear .
why are you being difficult now and not giving the are group the place that is in fact due to it in this matter ?
i put the proposal for a decision to the vote .
( the parliament adopted the decision )
and this seems to me an excellent opportunity to look at the progress of the commission and of parliament .
there have been too many initiatives for that .
but i think that we must also look to the future .
firstly , by means of the general principles of the treaty , in particular fundamental social rights .
and finally by specific provisions regarding equal opportunities .
and employment first of all .
mr president , i have two questions for the commission .
in what way is the commission taking this into account ?
mr president , i have a very specific budgetary question .
the structural funds are our most important instruments .
i think that is far too little .
this is what we must work towards .
we have established some rules on this .
we already are at the present time , moreover .
mr president , thank you for your commitment to the cause of women .
i really do believe that .
not at all !
and does he think that this should be applied in all countries ?
that is the responsibility of the social partners .
that is the treaty .
do you not think that these ten countries could find themselves in considerable difficulties ?
perhaps , and i hope this will be the case , amsterdam will bring us a solution on this matter .
that is a problem and i think the most important thing is to give these people work again .
is that a major cause of it ?
and if we create the euro , it will be to give europe an economic framework in which we will have more growth and more jobs . why ?
there are two things to which we should give priority .
firstly , responsibility and , secondly , solidarity .
legislative measures can only be a support in this area .
here too cooperation between member states in the area of justice is vital .
my group is in favour of that .
so there is no doubt that measures must be taken .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following three reports :
so let us see what we expect of the commission on this matter .
and the final problem which i would like to put to you is to do with education .
the commission does not do this .
my next point is this .
why ?
and jobs are what we want .
this objective approach is a quite central and important point .
even so , experience has shown that they do help . proper implementation of them could have a positive impact .
that is not the real issue .
but that is not the main reason .
i think it is our job to provide the information in the field .
and that is no good at all .
the three reports make the right points .
however , the negotiations with the council , on this matter too , will obviously be extremely difficult .
the debate is closed .
this was not a problem in the past .
it was simply a technical procedure .
the debate is closed .
let us help it to become a reality .
the debate is closed .
so i want to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report .
mr president , first of all i would like to say that we welcome this report .
they should be brought under the scope of the directive .
the debate is closed .
let us do what we can within the scope of our existing powers .
secondly , we want to encourage more workers back into the industry , particularly eu young people .
why ?
this requires a number of things to be done .
let me follow on from this .
that does not make sense in a european single market !
the debate is closed .
i know that the group of the european people 's party did not want me to use that term in my report .
this , of course , is the position with this report .
mr president , i should like to welcome the report .
i congratulate the rapporteur .
these have been a great success .
why is this ?
it is wrong and we should say so .
the debate is closed .
but i also think it is a responsibility of the european union , in terms of economic and social cohesion , to make sure that these regions receive the aid they need .
europe 's idea of development was not always the one the local people wanted .
never mind , let them have support .
let me therefore thank the rapporteur again .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
there are two things i want to focus on .
the joint debate is closed .
that is why the committee on fisheries accepted the proposed plan by a large majority .
the proposal before us simply does not concern that .
in particular of the european parliament .
that is why i wish to congratulate the commission and the commissioner in particular .
the problem of third countries has also been raised : it is a concern i share .
so obviously the commission cannot deal with other issues .
if the commission could make such a statement that would be very significant and would respect the will of the committee on fisheries .
the debate is closed .
this is a fundamental issue for this parliament .
that is not the citizens ' europe !
nor am i sure that in terms of content this agreement is the best we can achieve .
that is why i say : we need democracy now !
today we are not just discussing nuclear energy .
so we should make a clear statement now .
i want to return to the matter of democratic control of other nuclear agreements .
at least we must have parliament involved in these nuclear agreements in future .
the debate is closed .
i have some questions for the commission .
finally , i must congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
more than 1 , 000 cases are still open .
you made a particular request to me .
the debate is closed .
i was the rapporteur on that particular report .
and they have thus shown that they are in a position to create new jobs .
service is our success .
mr president , i would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report .
the debate is closed .
they have not received any of the aid .
mr president , it is my view that the european parliament took a very wrong decision yesterday .
i cannot vote in favour of the proposal , but hope that our amendments will be accepted .
mr president , parliament has tabled 12 amendments .
for those reasons the commission cannot accept amendments nos 1 to 10 .
that is the fact of the situation .
the debate is closed .
welcome
it has been brought to my attention that the council has adopted a statement in its own minutes in respect of this directive .
( parliament approved the joint text )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
at the moment we simply cannot .
you are quite right .
but such an approach is not enough .
but we do not share the view on this approach at all .
it seems to me that we really must step up community action in this area and the council really should be aware of this .
mr president , i would just like to thank those members who voted for my report .
as a whole we think that the report is a good one but we would still like to comment on a few points .
for this reason special aid is required for these areas .
but we do not agree that the solution to this problem is to allow these regions a special legal basis in the treaty .
the problem was that it did not work very well .
) it can never be wrong to establish the best possible idea of the impact of a political decision on various sectors of society .
as this , in my view , is a positive development , i have voted for the report .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
i would ask , mr president , if we could do something .
it is the european parliament we are talking about here , and i think the european parliament should set a good example .
very well .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the following amendments have been proposed :
in our group , as in the committee , we have not yet reached agreement .
this is why we put down this request .
( no change )
on behalf of the economic affairs committee i entirely agree with the rapporteur that some kind of regulation is needed .
i believe that we are dealing with a new right .
the question is , do we need a directive or do we need a regulation ?
mr president , i shall make just two points .
the debate is closed .
secondly , i share the rapporteur 's concern over the reports which we are discussing today .
that is why we are here .
unfortunately , however , it is not working at present .
madam president , ' europe must do less to do better ' .
those in favour of a united europe see the application of this principle as part of this political objective .
this is not the case .
for example , what the commission does plan to do is to step up everything concerning the assessment of the consequences of proposed action .
why ?
because we did not really have a very clear idea of what the sector wanted and what society wanted for that sector .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this may , however , be something that will change in the future .
there is one point which i consider to be particularly important .
sometimes we are not successful in everything .
but i think that this is a very important step in the right direction .
my group will be very pleased to vote for this report .
i refer to amendments nos 1 and 12 .
we did not want to have reports both from the members and from third parties .
we agree on that .
just a few comments , however .
i will make only two comments .
if this amendment is approved we shall vote in favour .
the only question is how best to ensure it ?
for this reason too i think this amendment is not appropriate .
the debate is closed .
in this parliament we vote too much and in the wrong way .
i rather doubt that .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
mr president , i would like to make a comment on today 's agenda .
( parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
welcome
unfortunately , this was not the case .
it is also a sustainable form of production .
our group is in agreement with this report and will therefore support it during today 's vote .
this requires a fundamental reform of quality control systems and a new policy on consumer protection .
if this article is not adopted as the legal basis , then we shall have to discuss the amendments .
as far as i am aware , the commission has not yet agreed on its position .
then we would agree to a debate on the matter .
i believe that this is an extremely important issue , and i hope the house will support our move .
mr president , i would also like this morning to congratulate the rapporteur and to welcome this report .
in the short time available to me , i can of course only address a few particularly important points .
we see that as essential .
mr president , i am pleased that today we are able to discuss a proposal in the agriculture sector which for once goes in the right direction .
for this reason i should like to thank the rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
in that case , regional conditions must be taken into account .
the debate is closed .
but there is a list of conditions for such an agreement , as you , of course , know .
the growth rate for next year will be more than 11 % .
i now turn to some specific points on the budget .
i know that there has been a lot of discussion of that issue in the committee on budgets .
thank you , mr president .
let me make just one comment on information policy .
we have not yet heard the final word on this matter .
your approach is the right one .
that is the procedure .
we are prepared to return to that issue later .
the debate is closed .
there is just one further thing i wish to say .
that also means that i naturally cannot accept this on my own initiative .
the debate is closed .
it cannot be right for us to do this .
the legislation should show what the member states have actually agreed upon .
mr president , i would like to give my support to the rapporteur 's proposals for this directive at second reading .
but we can see that this is not so .
the committee on the environment has had very little impact on this .
i should like to draw attention to the three main amendments which we have tabled .
a commission regulation on the review will be adopted in due course .
the majority of these have been included in the common position , for the most part on the initiative of the commission .
next there are the amendments on the committee procedure and initiatives by the commission .
these amendments are therefore acceptable in principle .
the debate is closed .
madam president , with regard to amendment no 1 , there has been some considerable discussion . may i make my group 's position clear .
amendment no 15
and the vote was quite clear , it seems to me .
( parliament adopted the decision )
it would have been excellent if this text had been included in parliament 's procedure of work .
we have also voted for amendment proposal number 15 .
the report is a move in the right direction so i have voted for it .
our view is that this is a fundamental principle which must be used often .
within the member states we could be talking about national , regional or local level .
so , the first question must obviously be : is this an issue for the union or not ?
welcome
community environmental law
so there is a problem .
so we do have a problem .
we think that in the first place we need greater transparency .
of course the resources for implementation must be sufficient .
i should also like to thank the commission for its communication and the rapporteur for all the work he has done .
should we not first make sure that what we already have is in fact put into practice ?
is it implemented ?
this is why environmental policy is such an important european policy .
i think this would be a good idea .
let us begin at community level .
they should be used more and more often .
it is clear from the report that this issue is not only one of great interest and priority for me , but also for the environment committee .
it was also good to see that in their discussion of the communication , both the committee of the regions and the economic and social committee reached a positive conclusion on the commission 's proposals .
i am pleased to say that considerable progress has already been made in these areas .
i therefore look forward to being able to report on the progress which is made in this area .
the debate is closed .
i believe that this is an issue which must be taken extremely seriously .
we can only hope , commissioner , that the council will do justice to parliament 's good work .
why do we want to change it ?
madam president , i wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report on this public health issue .
there are four main reasons for this and most of them have already been mentioned .
however , we can go further .
what is involved here , mr president ?
the commission can accept amendments nos 1 , 2 , 3 and 10 .
the debate is closed .
thank you very much for your attention .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is good that an agreement has been reached .
but they are much more too .
why is that ?
this , however , is not enough .
to that extent , i agree with you .
that does not exist today .
that is not the job of the union .
perhaps it could be done .
my second comment is rather more serious .
that , to my mind , would be the best approach .
where do we go from here ?
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
if we do not make the progress we hope to make then we have the full right to return to the wto .
if action is taken against european companies we certainly will do so .
subject : free movement and transport of agricultural products within the european union
and it seems that it has done what it had to do .
however , this is going to take two years before the court of justice .
that is the problem .
we think that this is a problem of balance .
how are we doing that ?
i thank the commissioner for all the information .
i want to thank the commission for its full reply .
there must be a positive response .
that is what dialogue is about . that is what we are doing in this way at this moment .
it is indeed possible .
that is all that i can say .
the action plan will be based on the green paper , and on the results of the dialogue taking place throughout the european union at this time on the basis of the green paper .
mr president , i do not have much to add to what the honourable member has just said .
the commission , then , has developed new initiatives in recent months .
is he taking that into consideration ?
i thank the commissioner for his answer .
the most important thing is that such a reference is included in the new text .
you will be aware , i know , that i am dealing with a report that is going through parliament at the moment on services of general interest .
first of all , one should understand that we are talking about a sector for which there is a specific framework .
for other activities the commission accepted that there could be transport aid .
the other question now is : what comes next ?
that is the context .
it is these which we want out in the open for discussion .
the principle is that no state aid can be given .
but this is the responsibility of the government and not of the commission .
this is still the same subject .
at the present moment there is no decision .
this should not lead to the conclusion that for other activities in the region concerned , transport aid cannot be given .
that is what happened .
that is all i can say .
so a solution had to be found .
this happened some time ago .
then , as i mentioned earlier , i asked my people to go down there and this took some time .
this is very , very serious .
i think that the commission should consider its social responsibility .
that has to be made clear .
you said , commissioner , that other transport aid is not out of the question in the region .
so that is out of the question .
the question time is closed .
the commission was true to its word .
but that is a subject to be discussed in the debate on the green paper .
why have i done so ?
the second point concerns the technical dialogue .
the joint debate is closed .
why ?
because the states lack the political will .
the member states should therefore be required to promote them when budget decisions are taken in the council .
as far as i am concerned three of them are particularly important .
i see nothing specific on this point in the green paper .
thank you , mr president .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were adopted )
that is just not acceptable .
i note your request .
if that is clear to everyone , i shall put that request to the vote .
i did think it might be a point of order , but it was not .
madam president , this is a very important commission proposal .
common security policy
i had to say that .
what can we in the house say about this ?
as we all know , security is clearly more than just a military issue .
however , when it comes to external security , our security at international level , there is a military aspect too .
what is our position ?
what is our policy ?
this is not something i welcome , it is simply a statement of fact .
we feel this is extremely important .
and once we have made progress , then we can start talking about what to do next .
of the several amendments which my group has tabled , i should like to draw your attention to two which we feel are particularly important .
we do not agree with this .
we do not agree with this either .
these are issues which we need to address .
i believe this goes against majority public opinion in our countries , and it is against our own interests of course .
the council , which is not here of course , should understand that .
europe must remain a civil power .
i think this is a good report .
i hope we will receive a response from the commission on this point .
but there are still proposals which are unacceptable .
there can be no doubt about this .
the proposal for a conference to discuss a common defence policy and a common defence position cannot be accepted .
clearly , without a security policy there can be no defence policy , and without a defence policy there can be no common foreign policy .
ladies and gentlemen , i know it is very difficult to keep to one 's speaking time , but i would like to draw this problem to the attention of the groups .
i now turn to the matter of drugs .
in conclusion , i support this report as far as it goes , but there is a lot more that should be done .
we must do all we can to bring about a society in which we can all live together .
i feel like saying ' at last !
did you know that ?
there is no real basis for a common foreign and security policy .
the debate is closed .
now why is this important ?
that , in short , is what should be said from the point of view of external trade .
i do not think so .
what needs to be done now ?
a un conference on this subject was held recently .
we therefore need to consider what our requirements are here in the european union .
this is extremely important .
the report which we are discussing is a step towards this .
we wish you every success .
this is perhaps the point of no return .
who is going to pay for that ?
we do not have the money in the social sector .
in my view , that is not what is required .
however , there are three points which i should like to stress .
this must stop .
i should like to make four comments .
it is time to take action , and up to now , as far as the commission and the council are concerned , very little progress has been made .
mr president , i really think something needs to be done here .
you were more successful than the president in doing that job because everyone has heard you now .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
mr president , i should just like to say a few words before we vote on amendments nos 2 , 3 and 4 .
i should like to propose this , and i think we should have a good majority in favour .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we consider this to be a very important issue which must be taken further when the matter is discussed in the european union .
at last , we might well say !
it should be given support and a framework for development at european union level .
it is my hope that the commission , perhaps through some of its research programmes , can make funding available to make this objective a reality .
we do not think that the european parliament should be given more power .
i am therefore voting in favour of this extremely important report .
it is good to see that several of the existing programmes have already been a great success .
finally , i have a request concerning our amendment .
this does not make sense .
mr president , i too should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur .
there are just a few further comments i should like to make , however .
i have a further comment on this last point .
this is something we have to accept and make clear to the people we are talking to there .
we would simply point out that there must also be scope for an individual approach to each of the countries in question .
i should say at this point that the committee on budgets has asked the commission to put forward proposals , but no reply has ever been received .
this seems to us to be the most serious aspect of the whole issue .
i just want to draw parliament 's attention to one point , mr president .
is that what we really want ?
what did we find ?
what should we do ?
i have no problem at all with the objectives that are set out .
i agree with you entirely , commissioner , because you have made it clear that the first step has not yet been taken .
i think i have already made that point quite clearly .
not at all .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i should like to express our opinion on a number of points .
that opinion is now available .
this was a decision of the council , a joint action at intergovernmental level .
the debate is closed .
that is why it is very important for the european union that a solution should be found in the context of the wto .
mr president , several points come to mind following the commission statement .
this decision is unacceptable .
we must support them in this respect .
that is unacceptable , both in form and in content .
why ?
who are they ?
the commission tell me that there are three people on that committee .
i would just add one point of a general political nature which has not yet been made in the debate .
the debate is closed .
two more points .
i no longer believe it .
( applause )
i shall make no comment on that .
she has said throughout the world what europe should have done , but she did not have the means to do it .
what can we demand ?
nothing , of course .
what can we hope for ?
there is open conflict .
what is going to happen now ?
what conditions are they going to put on ?
that is the kind of question that was discussed .
we must go further .
that is actually what happened .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
subject : cohesion fund
no , i should like to reach an agreement with you on the procedure .
in any case , something has to be done and the council should express an opinion .
a number of activities are already under way in this area .
it did not answer my specific question , which is how and when the regulation is going to be approved .
this is a serious responsibility .
it regards such legislation as unacceptable both in principle and in law .
i would like to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
i should like to ask what you think about this , and what information you have on it .
it is up to you to tell us what can be done to create such a system .
i would like to thank the council president for the answer i received .
there are also strong integration aspects here .
my question was next .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
that is not the best way of doing things .
having said that , the commission proposals have my support and that of the committee on fisheries .
that is only a start but it is an essential one .
this is particularly important .
then we mention in the report the role of the european parliament .
i have to ask some questions .
why about the fishing industry ?
i ask you to think about that .
this is a good report .
i hope people will support it .
the proposal has three objectives .
so i believe that a good job has been done .
this means that , in a sense , fisheries are part of the european union 's common foreign and security policy , and its policy on development .
moreover , fisheries policy is also part of structural and employment policy .
you said that we would vote on this tomorrow .
that is why this issue of going to the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights is so important .
thank you very much , mr president .
indeed , the problems are already too urgent for that .
we need a new european fisheries development policy .
this cannot be right .
the community has its priorities wrong and we need a new fisheries policy .
i cannot understand amendment no 2 .
this is not true .
and i cannot prevent that .
that is the same as the use of structural funds .
do we mean developing countries or to all agreements ?
i did and made no progress in the council .
so , why do we not try ?
that is the point .
what is wrong with that ?
( applause )
the two go together .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
it has , however , done so .
we all need the support of public opinion when it comes to energy problems .
i should like to mention the following points .
there is no doubt that at the moment the answer to that question is ' no ' .
but what would europe be without energy ?
what would agriculture be without energy ?
on the other hand , it is our purpose to promote the environment .
it can never be the task of the eu .
this certainly applies to my country as well as france and i think to germany and every other country .
why not ?
she was wrong .
we do not have to decide for another 15 or 20 years about investment in a new form of power .
member states must respect the decisions of other member states .
i therefore propose that we encourage cooperation , and coordination of national policies in the development of research .
i shall mention just two .
we are all aware of that .
i believe it is also a question of democratic policy .
and we need work . i refer to high technology .
that will be a difficult issue during the accession negotiations .
every technology goes on being developed .
it said no for environmental reasons , but above all for economic reasons .
why ?
this is the central question , it is a political question .
commissioner , what are we going to do about all this ?
and as you know , there is already a community plan of action .
that has to be said , you must agree with me there !
the debate is closed .
nor is it enough just to set this objective for the european union as a whole .
i know this kind of community strategy will cost money .
that is the future . european citizens know that .
and here the structural funds should be better involved .
my group will vote against that proposal .
i agree with you !
let us say no more about that .
then you will have my full support !
that is my first point .
where is the technology we are developing being applied there ?
if the 15 member states do not play along , nothing will come of all this .
it is not !
we always end up with systems which support the established order of things .
we have very little time .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that was very clear .
( applause )
during the vote
mr president , you say that the political groups know what is being voted upon here .
in my opinion the members should also know what is being voted upon .
i do not know what is being voted upon here .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , on a point of order .
and that is what we have done .
i should however like to point out that this is a very significant issue , a major issue of principle and a very important issue .
it would be possible to use the rules of procedure in a different way , when a significant matter of principle is at issue and i hope that this will happen in future .
i understand the point you make .
that really is true .
if we want to do so , we can .
i ask you to take that into consideration .
that is the way things go .
mr president , on a point of order .
we could not support the report at the vote .
this is not true .
there is no reason for the eu to develop a common defence policy or a common defence force .
that is why we voted against the report .
so we cannot vote for this report .
however , a lot remains to be done .
we know what happened next .
there is a whole list of amendment proposals from the green group .
the people do not want it ' .
the report does include positive proposals for increased nuclear safety .
i have , therefore , voted against this report .
therefore , much of the debate has already taken place .
and i think that , at this moment , both the council and the commission know the opinion of the members of this parliament in this respect .
i would now like to add something about content .
but the question of principle is even more serious .
well , where do we actually stand now ?
we are in favour of a reform of the wto .
we do not like it for three fundamental reasons .
that was the basis on which the commission finally reached agreement with the us .
with that in mind i should now like to go through the main points with you and point out the results achieved to date .
that is an important commitment from the us .
the joint debate is closed .
no , far from it !
i doubt it !
that is one reason it was right to put a stop to it .
these are just a few questions and many more could be asked .
perhaps the president of the commission can say something about this .
the second of these points is the more serious .
now to the political situation .
i share this hope with him and many others .
what will happen now ?
i do not know what other measures may be taken .
you have said most of what there is to say on the matter .
the joint debate is closed .
every five years elections are held but only three parties are allowed to take part in them .
it is right for us here in this house to draw attention to it .
that is what we are doing with this resolution and our group will vote in favour of it .
i am involved in that for the committee on foreign affairs , security and defence policy .
that must change and change quickly .
this did not happen .
i think we have to draw the appropriate political conclusions .
here we do nothing !
i think that the european union must also act to support consumer actions .
you can indeed force changes .
we cannot allow this situation to exist : we must do everything in our power to prevent it .
madam president , this motion for a resolution may not really be urgent in the technical sense .
as before , there is still a great need for action .
that could be a specific move to improve the situation .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
these colleagues might have taken an interest in what was going on in france .
thank you mr president .
mr president , i can certainly support what most of my colleagues have said .
the other countries will not be given the opportunity to look for ' victims ' in this way .
the debate is closed .
the internal energy market is now a reality .
thank you very much , commissioner .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this report is a first , but all too small , step towards this .
but the report is move in the right direction so i have voted in favour of it .
community energy objectives
the first of these objectives come under the community 's environmental policy .
of course energy policy has effects both on industry and on the environment .
but i think one thing is clear : in the matter of cooperation to achieve agreed energy objectives we also need a cooperation procedure between the legislative institutions .
yet we cannot agree on a basic energy policy !
only then will it be able to achieve the objective of sustainable development in the framework of integration of energy policy and environmental protection objectives .
we come now to the crucial point .
that is the crucial point .
i do not want to go into this further today .
what are you saying ?
this is a considerable task and i congratulate you , commissioner .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this important report .
now , let me comment one by one on the amendments proposed .
amendment no 1 concerns the legal basis of the proposal .
for those reasons , the commission cannot accept amendment no 1 .
the second part of amendment 3 can be accepted in principle .
if that is our purpose , i do not think this is the right way to achieve it .
this amendment is acceptable .
i agree absolutely with amendment no 10 .
i have no problem at all with the third part of amendment no 11 , which concerns the addition of environmental means .
a policy which in today 's situation is more than necessary .
the debate is closed .
together with my committee , i naturally support this document and see this as a very important initiative .
it is also very difficult to establish a common strategy for the whole region .
the debate is closed .
social legislation on road transport
i may , therefore , draw the following conclusions .
now what has the commission done ?
they are not doing anything .
the commission has done nothing .
thank you , commissioner .
no , mr president , i put a number of specific questions to the commission and have not received any reply to them .
and what does the commissioner say to us : words , words , words .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
in fact we still have the same date .
i had nothing to do with the motion .
( parliament approved the minutes . )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i would like to offer my full support for the conclusions of this report which call on the commission to work towards :
of course , we cannot stop there .
this technology itself can create entirely new jobs .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
all three countries have made more or less equal progress .
i see them very clearly in the need to create more employment again in the european union .
the programmes are , however , absolutely essential for these areas .
the committee also agreed with this and adopted our amendment proposal .
i believe it is essential to prevent any such effects in future .
however , this has not as yet been successful .
this applies in particular to objective 4 and objective 3 .
these are proposals which could make regional policy more effective .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
however , we shall take account of your request .
i believe that is important .
it is their task to carry it out .
cooperation is an important point .
moreover , these programmes are a means of taking account of the specific nature of the individual regions of europe .
these are opportunities for europe .
above all , an open europe requires political will at all levels .
madam president , it is good to see proposals for increased cooperation between regions both within and outside the eu .
it is important that the eu does not turn in on itself .
it is sufficient for them to meet and work out their agreement .
this parliament asked as much of the intergovernmental conference .
for my part , however , i would like to say that special note should be taken of a number of points which are included in the report , but which in my view are particularly important .
all regions in europe continue to need european community initiatives .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i stress for example the tax aspect .
keep it up !
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , the first item on the order of business is a communication from the commission on urgent political matters of major importance .
mr president , on a point of order .
what rule do we use ?
how is it done ?
( the minutes were approved )
agenda
( parliament agreed to this proposal )
take the funding system for the political parties .
for some reason , it was not able to .
mr president , on behalf of my group , the group for a europe of nations , i should like to support this joint request .
i put this motion to the vote .
( parliament approved the request )
urgent political matters
the next item is the communication by the commission on urgent political matters of major importance .
have there been any developments on this ?
of course it remains to be seen whether they actually keep to their word .
let us be quite clear about this .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
any changes made will have to be made in that direction .
in particular :
they are included in one text and all of them have been approved by the committee on budgets .
what we need is not only increased investment and the confidence of the business community , but also the confidence of the population at large .
it is for this reason that we have tabled amendments in the committee on social affairs and employment to these regulations .
that is not enough .
it is investment for the future of society as a whole .
will the commissioner stand up to the monetary committee ?
those were the points at issue in the negotiations .
as regards the budget , i am not yet sure what the position is .
there is as yet no political agreement on any of these issues .
unfortunately , we have not achieved this aim .
i have little to say as a result .
i give the floor to mrs green .
it has been the demand of this parliament for a long time and we hope it will happen .
i hope that will be taken back very clearly to the intergovernmental conference .
so what is the reality ?
why , then , can this approach not also be applied in other areas ?
but we believe that europe has much to offer to itself , its own citizens , and the whole world .
i wish the president-in-office every success in his work over the next few days .
no indeed - that is certainly not our role !
( applause from the green group )
however , i have to say that is not enough .
that is why it is so very important that note is taken of the comments here .
one final comment about the lack of transparency .
and that is not being done !
mr president , time is short and already a lot has been said about these matters .
what will the results be ?
this is no good .
that is no good .
that could be better .
next , job creation .
mr president , i shall stop there .
i have heard from the different political groups what their concerns are .
resolutions have been presented and tomorrow will be put to the vote , and for us they will be a very important reference .
that is what i wanted to draw your attention to .
the debate is closed .
why ?
this is the way to create jobs and achieve greater economic progress .
the debate now is in the council , i would say .
i would also add that the amendments accepted by the commission , following the european parliament 's first reading , have been taken up by the commission and accepted by the council .
therefore , i do not see why the same should not be true of the second reading .
it took them when it presented the green paper .
we have set up instruments for economic coordination .
it is now for the policies to add a practical content to this and to implement what we have put into place .
this is a very important job .
you also say that the public are not going to believe in the euro .
but they have not been accepted .
i hope i am wrong .
there is also a framework .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
eu tax systems
the commission has discussed these issues , over the past year in particular , with the member states and with parliament .
however , we think that this is not quite the case .
my second general point concerns the voting rules .
the people expect this too .
i believe that the european parliament will do all it can to support the commission 's efforts .
but what do we see ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
just look at the case of technical regulations .
that is still a long way off .
the directive on this is to come into force at the same time as the euro .
i think we do not have any further problems with this , and i hope that the action plan will work .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it is my opinion that we should put an end to this state of affairs as quickly as possible .
the european parliament is certainly the most appropriate place to set that process in motion .
there is , of course , a reason for this .
nevertheless , people do turn to them .
not at all .
but that amendment goes further .
that really is going too far !
what is it all about ?
( applause from the left )
finally , i should like to refer to the financial aspect of this question .
obviously not .
the public very much needs information in this field .
what form will future training standards take , and will it be possible to focus on new issues in the area of research ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
there is no reason why the european union should not take over the powers of that treaty .
as well as that , we have an opportunity to create new employment and new training .
i ask every member to support it .
for example , we could be using the structural funds .
i think this is certainly the case here , but i have to say that there are really very few of us to be discussing such an important issue .
the only question is who should take it , and how .
parliament and the commission must pay more attention to this sector , which is so important from the social point of view .
there is also no legal basis for it , which is why we have said that we will not vote for the report .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
what did the council do ?
the same is true of the other information systems , moreover .
unfortunately , however , that is not the case .
that is not what we want or need !
we will therefore just have one system and not two .
the joint debate is closed .
the main aspects of the regulation are the following :
that is quite old - in fact , it is as old i am and that is quite old .
the proposed regulation is therefore extremely welcome in this regard .
commissioner , perhaps you should say something about one of parliament 's amendments which i regard as particularly important .
the commission can therefore agree to amendments nos 1 and 4 .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
thank you !
( parliament approved the minutes )
europe already has freedom of movement , and this is something we wish to promote .
and what had they done ?
will you do so as soon as possible ?
will you talk to them as soon as possible and report back to us ?
i should like to thank the commission once again for its proposals and for the successful cooperation we have had , and i hope that my amendments will be adopted .
naturally , this is something which must be supported , and something which we do in fact support .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we have had the single market for quite some time .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i naturally support these two proposals .
but this has not been the case .
this is what we are going to change today .
that is one point .
what does amendment no 10 say ?
as i said to you , the commission has done some very good work and its amendment , as tabled , is one we can agree with .
in other words , we want to change very little to the draft proposal which has been put to us by the commission .
and this is not because there have been no problems .
we do not want to find ourselves in years to come with these same problems .
my own amendments focus on safety aspects .
i should like to take those at the end of what i have to say .
however , there are a number of amendments which the commission cannot accept .
amendments nos 1 and 2 cannot therefore be accepted by the commission .
i wanted to vote against .
mr president , i would ask you to look again at the result of the vote just now .
( parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution )
i believe this is a joint success on the part of parliament .
( parliament adopted the proposal )
( parliament adopted the proposal )
before the final vote
mr president , i should like to speak before the vote .
( parliament adopted the proposal )
amendment no 12
mr president , i wish to say something about paragraph 12 .
can i do so now ?
( parliament adopted the proposal )
this is why we are voting against the resolution .
will they be heard ?
i do not think so .
monetary union is vital but not enough .
in other words , we must have ' more social ' .
more important still is that we must achieve close coordination of budgetary policies .
the single currency is not an aim in itself .
the real aim of the policy is social cohesion .
the common position on which we had to give our opinion takes up 15 of those amendments .
it is my hope that the european parliament will follow the guidelines of our rapporteur and support his amendments .
this is why we cannot vote for this report .
tax policy should continue to be a national matter in the future .
for this reason i have voted against the report .
enough is already available in the various member states .
what is needed now is action .
for these reasons , i have voted against the report .
are there any comments ?
i want to know when we can question the commission on this issue .
( parliament approved the minutes )
it was the previous government rather than the present one that was responsible for this .
it is a matter for the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights .
the real issue , though , is that we cannot do our job .
( applause )
order of business
no amendments have been proposed .
i give the floor to mrs green .
we understand now that this is not the case .
let us take one part at a time .
i am going to put the proposal to the vote .
you see the pressure we are under !
we will try to do it .
i agree , that is what i said .
i simply cannot see the reason for this .
we need to be able to discuss these issues .
it is not just the vote that is important .
the whole issue is important .
agricultural debate
it seems quite clear .
( parliament approved the proposal )
there will be no members left in the house by then !
is that not possible ?
they are all doing important work .
it is not just the council i comment on .
let me give you an example .
that is case one .
and that is why we have to improve the way we work .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is the european parliament and not the place for that type of speech .
which will be included on the list , and which not ?
which will be seen and which not ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
health monitoring
i think that common sense is on our side .
the european parliament for its part has made clear its position that the protection of the health of europe 's citizens must be a main policy concern of the european union .
as with so much in this field , these conclusions should be seen as just a start .
in this context , there are two particular points that the commission would like to comment on .
in view of the important work involved in such a programme , there is something to be said for this point of view .
the debate is closed .
this debate and the programme are welcome , of course .
i think that this , whether or not included in the environmental management plan , would be a major step forward .
we all agree that this is a first step down a road where progress has to be made .
therefore we must do something .
public information is another good idea .
but there are certain european aspects .
i would , however , like to see it developed into a framework directive .
we have also not had a clear answer from the commissioner on whether or not there is to be a framework directive .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
we raised it again yesterday . the president said he would ask the commission .
mr president , i wish to make a point concerning question time .
in answer to an earlier question .
( parliament approved the minutes )
we ask for your assistance on that case .
now we find that the committee on external relations has not discussed the matter .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i shall come back to that question in a moment .
what are the concerns ?
the main concern is unemployment .
my concern is of another nature .
i think that all of the main decisions have been taken .
that is now the past .
we have now reached the stage of implementation .
there will be difficulties but they will be difficulties of implementation .
it is not a wish for the future .
but in my view this house also needs to make a political assessment .
then the currency can work !
now who can say which will be in and which will be out ?
europe today needs to develop , to work .
our great problem today is unemployment . there is no work .
but that has now happened .
those , ladies and gentlemen , are some of the fundamental questions that i try to answer in my report .
why ?
and who is really going to be able to make sense of all of that ?
europe 's economy can only benefit from that and , not least , its employment market .
we have made no impact on the unemployment situation .
this must be an economic and monetary union that is not an end in itself but a means to an end , namely a balance that will allow jobs to be created .
is it not time for us to look at a new model of development within the european union ?
you could do that today for us .
that is where we now stand .
that is over !
but we must tell it like it is and not as we would like it to be .
we now have an opportunity to change things .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my party group .
our common institutions are the external framework which set the long term conditions .
we do not need that either .
i therefore hope , perhaps against hope , that the amsterdam summit will bring some progress in this area .
the commission has indeed put some of these questions to the court of justice for resolution .
not long ago , a stability council was set up at the request of the french .
so what means should be adopted to keep within these principles ?
what would this line mean if put into practice ?
greater national freedom of action for budgetary policy .
how should it be implemented ?
however , we must go further .
the council , the commission and parliament all regard the fight against unemployment as our number one priority , and rightly so .
this tax , though , does not come without its problems .
i believe that is not necessary .
without the people 's support we are no longer a union .
of course , the commission goes along with the principle and objectives of your resolution .
to comment on your motion for a resolution in relation with the debate that i have heard this morning , i shall try to answer two questions .
first of all , the instruments .
i think that we first of all need the political will .
this coordination of economic policies is beginning to have positive effects .
look at what we proposed in the new treaty on the subject of employment .
that is the political will but political will is not everything .
you also need a framework .
what should that coordination of economic policies deal with ?
i would say all questions of common interest .
now it has to be put into practice .
it is for the various institutions to do so .
i would like to start with a political point .
that has to be made quite clear .
what can it do to help employment ?
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , we have a further problem with the vote on paragraph 15 .
this is a very important political issue .
i would vote against this report if we cannot reach agreement on it .
it has therefore been put to the vote with the word ' new ' .
so i do not think there has been a problem at all , and i think that you know what you are voting on .
so the word ' new ' is not in the text .
but the majority voted against it .
i have no idea why .
before the final vote
did the text adopted by the committee include it or not ?
that is how the report has been approved thus far and how it will be approved finally if you vote for it .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
in this area , as in others , this has unfortunately not been taken into account .
it must now be taken up by the governments .
it is a public health problem .
i do not think so .
i do not think that is right in these circumstances , which is why i cannot vote for the content of this report .
for this reason , i have voted against the report .
we would like to thank the rapporteur for a well prepared report .
it should still not be possible to force member states into taking decisions on tax issues against their will .
tax policy should really be a national issue .
i have , therefore , voted against the report .
that is the end of voting time .
i hope the commissioner will be able to deal with this in his response .
the debate is closed .
that can and must not be allowed to continue , commissioner !
europe has to make the most of that sector .
i have one or two points to make which i think are significant .
( applause )
if a matter is not discussed , then there can be no further progress .
we have , after all , made specific proposals .
you have the text there after all .
but you cannot say that that cannot be done !
you cannot expect me to believe that there is no legal basis for this !
the debate is closed .
so , once again , i would like to express our support for it .
if we adopt this directive , that is what will be done , at least until 2001 .
the debate is closed .
again i agree with the rapporteur .
as i mentioned , there are some amendments that the commission cannot accept .
i therefore cannot accept amendment no 5 .
the debate is closed .
they will never do it !
we do not therefore support the motion for a joint resolution due to be adopted at the close of this debate .
the problem now is how to get agreement on the existing programme in the council .
unfortunately , even now , this programme is still with the council and it has not been possible to get a decision .
we shall back you , commissioner .
if necessary , you can put your urgent request again .
mr president , i will look at that possibility and try to be at the meeting .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will be taken tomorrow .
question time ( commission )
i hope that your words will be quite clear .
what we actually need simply a proper system .
create new jobs , before you start to close jobs down .
it has no place in a single market .
i hope then that something will finally be done and that the new french government will take up this matter .
i therefore consider it important that that possibility should be included in the new treaty .
i do not think that there can be any good reason why some people do not pay tax in the country in which they live and work .
i would very much like an answer to this question .
there is no problem here .
it is not the first time these questions have been raised .
i heard the commissioner with some interest .
i hope you will do the same thing in the commission .
do you agree ?
unfortunately , that is the case .
i hope we can change it but that is the case in countries with high unemployment .
i still hope that i can go forward with the line i have presented here today .
thank you , commissioner , for your answer .
i should like to ask two further questions .
i believe that the commission will present a proposal by the end of the year .
so on this particular issue , one question is not enough .
but i cannot get information from the legal service .
but if it really is a point of order , you have the floor .
thank you for your help - but it was not a point of order .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
that is the important point .
that will have , of course , also to ensure that no decision is taken in favour of one party or the other .
but i understand that you do not want to get involved .
mr president , i have already said that we shall be taking a decision next week .
the commissioner will tell us next week .
we did not allow the national governments to have it .
i therefore fully agree .
where will it lead us ?
that is a difficult technical issue .
i do not know whether you are clear about it .
we shall get there one day , as the industry is working towards it .
that is another technical system .
do you follow me ?
you said that if there is no agreement next week , the commission will adopt a decision and position .
i am sure that if you could put forward those terms , an agreement might come about . that is my question .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
it is more than 10 years since we made these changes .
if we want more power for this parliament and more respect and responsibility , we have to be responsible in our approach to the budget .
i hope that i have made some responsible proposals and i look forward to the commissioner 's reply .
there are a few points i should like to make .
this is another point i wish to bring to the attention of the president-in-office .
i am a rapporteur too .
that is all i have to say , and i just hope this will be accepted .
of course , you were well of that .
the european parliament has given its opinion and now it is up to the council to give its .
quite simply , we are coming up against this budgetary problem .
that is another reason to put yet more energy into it .
that means that you would like to receive , as quickly as possible , a commission proposal on this subject .
specific commission proposals already exist for some areas of production , and others will follow in the course of the year .
as a parliament , are we or are we not a budgetary authority ?
i hope also that the commission and the council will come to understand it .
i agree with the commissioner .
how was this possible ?
commissioner , i believe that budgetary problems are not the main issue as far as you are concerned .
that was the case six months ago .
so you are making it difficult for us .
what has been left ?
that has nothing to do with europe .
i hope my colleagues on the other side of the house will put pressure on the new minister of agriculture to make the request to get the support .
we are beginning to give in to the united states even before they ask us .
mr president , mr president-in-office , commissioner , i address the house on these three reports as the rapporteur for the committee on budgets for the 1998 budget .
there are two points i should like to single out from what the council presidency said .
we all know that but the farmers do not .
perhaps it is a good thing for a few of us here to speak out and say that .
i hope that the council will agree to our proposal on that point as well .
all things considered , we must ensure sustainable agriculture with quality products in the eu .
that is one of my points .
that is the future for agriculture in europe .
do not let things come to that .
but is this fair ?
this change is also welcome .
not all of us can support this policy .
let us hope we can .
that is where the monetary speech comes in .
i thank the president-in-office of the council for being here .
on this side of the house we are as one .
we try to live in the real world .
that is what we are trying to do with the amendments that have been put forward from our side .
why ?
there is general agreement on this .
we did not .
, president-in-office of the council .
the debate is closed .
has the commission received any reply from the wto ?
i know that there are some member states that want that .
and how should countries which already have national standards in this sector act ?
the commission never said that .
so that is the situation .
the commission is working on it .
i am against it .
i do not !
that is the real problem .
if a majority of you want to change it , then , as i said , there is nothing i can do to stop you , nor would i want to .
i just want to make sure you understand what the result will be , and that result is not good for the consumer .
the regulation has been in force since may .
so there is a responsibility on the commission .
the commission is involved in the proposal when it first comes to us .
it is involved in the second reading .
you referred to a directive .
but that goes without saying !
you know me .
because that is the real problem !
the joint debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
obviously i expect her to take legal action and , if she does not , one can only draw the appropriate conclusions .
( the minutes were adopted )
mr president , i would like to change the subject .
( applause )
i shall come back to this .
finally , the european currency project will be presented in amsterdam .
i shall begin by the area of freedom , security and justice .
now i am coming to another key point : institutional questions .
we must take measures . enlargement will call for a better organisation on our part .
it is employment , the environment , that type of issue .
thank you very much , mr president-in-office of the council .
as for the number , that has not yet been decided , i think .
mr president , if there is a question that concerns all european , it is that of employment .
but this is urgent .
it is today .
all the member states wanted that .
the role of the social partners is especially important here .
( applause )
you have the floor , mrs green .
what is our position ?
we all agree on this .
but it is also of vital importance that employment should become an objective of the european community .
that at least is our position .
but how can it be put into practice ?
the european parliament has been saying this for two years .
the point i wish to make this morning is that job creation should be the central priority .
madam president , mr president-in-office , mr president of the commission , thank you very much for your words .
i think that at this time the european parliament 's work should be to make sure that you and the governments actually achieve those results .
i think that we should also find an appropriate role for the european parliament .
i think that , if we make an effort , we can achieve a good result .
i think that this effort must focus on two points :
the elections which have recently been held in a number of member states should ensure this is the case .
mr president-in-office , mr president of the commission , i call on your sense of responsibility , that we are aware of .
but further progress in that direction is needed in amsterdam , because we want and need this intergovernmental conference to be a success .
the european parliament has a very special part to play here .
the same applies to policy on legal and internal affairs .
the same applies to the foreign and security policy .
this is in everyone 's interest .
as for security , the action taken in order to promote it is not clear .
what does this mean ?
several points .
secondly .
is it not possible to think up a new system ?
but we are especially concerned about what has not been achieved .
what i would ask you is to fight in order to achieve this aim .
in other words , we have made progress on a certain number of points but not all of them .
i think that the negotiations have taken new demands into account .
what can we therefore do at this stage of the debate ?
that is the subject that concerns everyone .
it is therefore a good thing for employment policy to be mentioned in the treaty .
second example : public service .
it should be made more specific , as the european parliament demands .
the european union is made up of equal member states .
well , i ask the president-in-office this : what has actually been done about it , and what hope is there that something can still be done ?
we all know that the decision about the commission has been put off , but it is obviously essential to move forward on these matters with a view to the enlargement .
today , new and important decisions about the future are being made .
today , it is up to the european parliament to make its contribution to the intergovernmental conference .
some things have been achieved . some things remain to be done .
i simply cannot accept that .
i cannot do any colleague a favour on this .
that is how it is .
that is all very good , but it does not take the place of a policy .
work that one out .
this is a question we can talk about .
i should be very pleased if we could achieve a result .
enlargement on this basis will not be possible .
this should be the case in the commission too .
i would say there are two reasons for taking it into account .
i know and can tell you that the french government will do all it can .
a change there would be most welcome .
could a solution be found to these problems ?
this is an extremely important time for the european union .
i also know what your agenda is .
unfortunately , it is not possible for me to give everyone a reply because of the time that we have available .
but it is not really necessary .
you have mentioned them all .
but , even if france did not do so , other countries would ask for the same .
i should also like to mention transparency which is a major point for all of you .
in other words , there really is parliamentary control over this .
job creation is our first priority .
the debate is closed .
since the vote has taken place , but obviously not at the right time , perhaps you could have another vote ?
that is why we voted on the text to which that amendment referred .
i do not think we need another vote .
every member of the british labour party in this house is aware of the policy of the labour party .
that is not a problem for us .
good .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
european council
is this regulation not the same as saying that the eu is a state ?
in view of this , i have voted against the resolution .
since the joint resolution does not take that line we cannot support it .
draft treaty
they are not in the know .
let us , for example , take the proposals in the draft treaty in the areas of security , justice and immigration .
the real difficulties are the budget and agriculture , rather than institutional matters .
no mention is made of the objective of full employment .
is this situation due to the instruments or to the will of the member states to use them ?
i shall stop here .
madam president , i thank the president-in-office of the council for his comments .
that is absolutely right .
i found it excellent .
the members of my group would like to look at the various aspects of the policy .
we support this approach .
no comment .
i think this is excellent .
what is a common foreign policy and what is it trying to achieve ?
what it cannot address is the lack of political will .
we have to improve parliament 's role in a common foreign and security policy .
we have to look to ourselves if we are really to take a major role in the developing foreign and security policy .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is where the role of the european parliament comes in .
the debate is closed .
action must be taken , over and above the present framework .
i support your position .
it goes without saying that this european approach is necessary .
the states must therefore use these instruments .
in other words , the council really is taking this seriously .
that is a fact , but let us make it quite clear , you really must act quickly .
i refer particularly to the convention on the protection of community financial interests .
a great deal of effort was required to reach agreement on this issue .
as far as the commission is concerned , we will of course continue to develop those instruments required to protect the eu 's financial interests in the best possible way .
perhaps i did not fully understand what she said .
perhaps you can answer that question for me .
do you want a guarantee ?
and that is a responsibility that no one can really take .
is that serious ?
we need to get a change in procedures .
my colleagues have already asked the vital questions .
what is the reason for it ?
of course this cannot be allowed to continue .
of course , we only have a text .
then we have a convention .
we have a treaty but it should not stop there .
for me this is a vital point at this time .
of course , this is a problem that cannot go on in europe .
i agree .
we ourselves do not know .
everyone has said so .
this is what i wanted to say .
now we just have to put them into practice .
thank you very much , minister .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
questions to the council .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
here is my answer to these two questions .
this was really not much of a reply from the council .
you must , after all , have considered this point !
what we need is a common european policy .
once these proposals have been made , the council would obviously then have to take due account of the european parliament 's opinion on this matter .
' .
what impact is it going to have ?
what will the social and economic consequences be ?
you mentioned measures to be taken by the council .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
if so , why , in what form and to what amount ?
in other words , your question is on the agenda .
i would also like a proper answer to the first question since it is crucial for us .
i would also to say thank you for the answer .
if this is the case it will be extremely serious .
i heard that reply from the council with considerable interest .
it is nothing new for this to happen .
i do not think this is good enough .
i hope not .
i thank the president-in-office for her reply .
that does not deal with the issue .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
that would give us an appropriate set of measures .
is the council going to increase those resources ?
why is the european union 's strategy so good as a whole ?
i am aware of the situation referred to by the member .
i think we really have to get down to work on this .
this matter is of important economic and social value .
that is my opinion .
let us turn to the decision .
my response is the following .
could you tell us about this urgent matter ?
now we have the results to hand .
there was almost a civil war in the country .
but i do have a clear question to put to the council .
i could go on .
economic relations are also political relations .
we are pleased that human rights issues have a central place in the report .
this report is , i think , a first important step in that direction .
i have no idea .
that is our objective .
now how do we achieve it ?
that is not enough either .
but we also have to give the appropriate help .
in addition to trade and cooperation there is the question of human rights .
the debate is closed .
in this respect , the european union has an important task .
there are three points of special interest to us here .
the region is also important from the point of view of political stability .
the role of russia is also important .
mr president , i should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur .
i hope my amendments will be adopted .
i agree with that .
the debate is closed .
we still have a long way to go .
mr president , the committee on women 's rights has obviously taken an interest in this report and thanks the rapporteur for having accepted a large number of its proposed amendments .
why is this ?
i will just mention a few of the proposals that we would like the commission to consider .
it is a good report .
mr president , support this excellent report !
i hope that the commission will give this proposal support and follow it up .
i have a little less confidence in the council , as i said earlier .
legislation is important but , on its own , it is not sufficient .
many changes are needed .
the labour market needs to change .
although legislation is important , this is really a matter for the partners in the labour market .
we must get them to take these matters seriously .
we hope that the commission communication may help to promote development in the right direction .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
in other words they must show the way .
what important role can europe and the member states play ?
at european and national levels .
but the single market on its own is not enough .
that is my speech .
the question is : what should this role be ?
what will happen then ?
i hope that things will be much better in the future .
we have made a lot of progress on this over the last two years .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
research and sustainable development
our debate will and must continue .
environmental protection demands great economic efforts .
there are many other points i could make .
first of all , at what rate should changes be made ?
that is why i shall be voting against the report .
it is not enough to develop technology .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , you have been given a very clear opportunity to promote sustainable development in europe .
thank you too , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
there is more that could be said , but instead i shall put a question .
what about the united states ?
we should be in the same position as we are today .
it is now time to mention the wto .
it is difficult , though , to vote in favour of this draft .
that need not be the case .
reference has been made to the united states .
of course , it would have been better if we could have achieved more than that .
as i have said the situation with the united states is different .
we do not yet have an agreement with them .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
so far , however , i have not received an answer to my question .
i should therefore like to ask if and when i can expect a reply .
mr president , on a point of order .
that is the position we find ourselves in .
we agree entirely .
we call on the commission to ensure that this is the case .
( applause )
the most important issue , to my mind , is that of the legal framework .
that also means close cooperation between the various organisations concerned in the european union .
europe must be for the people ; it must be about the real issues that concern people .
the main interest of this service is now accepted .
there are many positive points in this programme .
young people are the future of europe .
why do i say this ?
however , the implementation of the programme is being held up in a number of member states .
so where are we now ?
this is an important subject , however , and we should look further at it , in discussions in the council .
we are therefore trying to do things quickly .
we do not have all that much money to begin with .
we shall do all we can to help them .
this is just the beginning .
the problem you refer to is a major one .
that is why we need the european parliament 's help in this matter .
the debate is closed .
let us get on at last with what we can do well !
but now we are left with no money .
it is about people , it is about young people .
there is , however , a problem of funding .
there are two things that must not happen .
education is a very important aim , and i hope it is an aim that we shall achieve .
that , unfortunately , is not the case .
only now will certain areas within the programme become fully available for the first time .
that is unacceptable .
thank you .
i can only welcome that support .
of course , we can accept that amendment .
the same is true of the third amendment .
thank you .
the debate is closed .
as you can see , the situation is quite difficult .
( applause )
i now put the legislative resolution to the vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
so that is a technical matter .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
nothing was done .
we think that this is the most that can be achieved at the moment .
the amendment is much more positive than the commission 's proposal .
that is why we support it .
in the coming years , these resources must be further increased .
it is of particular importance to the local economy .
no !
so i have voted against this resolution .
for the most part this is a good report .
yet that system does not work .
we do not want this .
for the most part the report is good but there are two points which i cannot agree with .
and that is all .
that is not our opinion .
the report is a move in the right direction , so i have voted for it .
this is a good report .
i shall therefore refer to the form rather than the basis .
madam president , once again we are dealing with a problem that we face every year at around this time of year .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
what has europe done ?
let us hope that the council and the commission , with the help of the european parliament , might one day propose such a policy .
thank you , commissioner . the debate is closed .
this is not the first time that the european parliament has expressed itself on this subject .
but is it not time to follow the united states ' lead and ban investment ?
i would like to ask the commissioner whether he will put this proposal to the european council .
but it seems that the stand we have made has not achieved results .
that is certainly having an effect .
that is very important .
i therefore hope that this resolution will be adopted .
but that is the only new development .
that is not all .
we welcome the fact that it was possible to reach a joint compromise motion for a resolution which is to be put to the vote .
we must do everything we can to put an end to this .
that is why i support the demands made in the motion before us .
there is also a serious lack of cooperation with the international court .
well done !
the debate is closed .
this must stop .
the debate is closed .
i only have two comments to make .
we support the resolution .
the debate is closed .
mr president , on a point of order .
the treaty is the european union 's law .
these measures already go further than the existing eu measures .
that too would be enough to give it a legal basis .
i do not understand this way of going about things .
so is there some kind of political problem ?
let us be quite clear about this .
what do we want ?
we actually want two things .
the task force will have an extremely difficult role to play .
the debate is closed .
this is something that in principle parliament does not accept .
i agree with that in principle .
that is an urgent task .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i did vote on every vote yesterday .
that was not about the minutes , but we have made a note of it .
( parliament approved the minutes )
there is another point i should like to mention .
such a force should be left in peace .
however , it must be possible to promote this sector , which is of such great interest to the citizens , at eu level .
madam president , i have just one question .
thank you very much .
we shall look into it .
thank you very much .
we shall look into it .
madam president , on a point of order .
do you agree ?
what were we voting on ?
thank you very much .
that was what members wanted .
( applause )
( applause )
these are the main points of the position of the committee on development and cooperation .
however , majority voting alone is not enough .
the commission 's proposal is concerned only with the decision making procedure in european institutions .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution . )
particularly when we are dealing with member states , the fisheries committee will be asked for its views and opinion .
there is a problem of transparency as well .
we can only achieve more transparency by being involved .
i think that goes without saying .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the vote will take place after the debate .
i would add to this another question . how quickly will this happen ?
in other words , no one took this opinion seriously .
and that really needs to be made quite clear .
i just wanted to add that point .
we have to face it .
a compromise has been put forward , which is not yet acceptable .
we ask that we may come back to you on this .
the debate is closed .
to that extent , it is also essential that we should reach agreement on this question today .
i should therefore like to ask all members of parliament present to vote in favour of this report .
this is the subject of the report that we shall be voting on today .
allow me to make a comment here .
this is going to become even more important in future .
thus we ourselves are dealing with individual aspects .
this is why it is so important to take into consideration competition law .
but it is present in the current document .
it is not yet included in my report .
the debate is closed .
( parliament approved the legislative resolution )
he has not taken this house into his confidence , which he should have done .
it is not good enough for the european parliament , which was responsible for significant agreements .
thank you , mr president , and thank you , commissioner , for your statement .
well they would be would not they ?
i hope that is true .
one is the point about still having to go to the council and then to the commission before any action can be taken .
the debate is closed .
ladies and gentlemen , allow me to thank the presidency 's services for their cooperation .
thank you all for your cooperation .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i want to speak on a point of procedure .
that did not happen either .
( the minutes were approved )
welcome
urgent political matters
first , the euro .
secondly , the economic situation .
finally , it will have a legal basis for making practical decisions to promote employment .
parliament will , of course , be involved in our work .
mr president , i have two short questions for the commissioner :
i now want to ask you two questions .
secondly , you ask what initiative we are going to take .
of course international companies , even if they are not based in a euro country , will be able to use the euro .
do you wish to reply , mr commissioner ?
that is a very good question .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
so , on behalf of my group , i support the request for reference back to committee .
i put the request to refer the report back to committee to the vote .
was legislation necessary or not ?
and if so , was a directive the right way to go about it ?
she decided that it was and i congratulate her on the work she has done .
i hope at least this text will be approved .
we shall vote in favour with some amendments because something is better than nothing .
this has not been done .
this is why we have made an amendment proposal for this particular point .
this is not the case in article 10 .
this is why we have made our amendment proposal .
i understand the commission is concerned about this .
this proposal is the wrong proposal .
this proposal is the wrong proposal .
the debate is closed .
this is why i welcome the commission 's proposal which means we will be making a real effort at european level to deal with these problems .
we are talking about safety at work here .
there are several things like this in the text .
this is progress .
if we accept these amendments , then together with the commission proposal we believe it will make a good directive .
my group will be voting in favour of it .
mr president , i would like to welcome the commission proposal .
it is important not just for the safety of the environment but in particular for human health and safety .
there are three things in the commission proposal which i welcome .
this really is essential .
finally , i should like to thank the rapporteur .
what parliament or even the council then did to it would have been another matter .
so who did the commission speak to ?
and in what form did it speak to them ?
the european parliament thus has a vital role to play here .
let me turn now to the amendments we do not want to accept .
that is why we do not want to accept that amendment .
it did not do so , which is why all the other member states accepted the commission 's position .
the debate is closed .
i now turn to the report itself .
parties are created by the people .
in this context , i certainly support the rapporteur .
then we will see how serious the house is about transparency !
we have done that in the past and will continue to do so .
that needs to be said very clearly !
the debate is closed .
the information society
the next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the following reports :
as we all know , information in itself is power .
on paper everything is in place .
at present just 2 % of the regional funds are used for this .
the same applies to the european social fund .
it is possible to do more and better things with the same money .
the information society is not only a question of technology , it is also a question of the impact on society .
this is where we must start .
this is where we must make more progress .
i think we have to consider the technical and legal aspects of this .
we also find , for example , that certain standards have never even been developed .
i think that this must be a political priority .
young people are the future of the eu .
that is a very important step .
the european institutions must also think of their own information technology policy .
the commission must do that , and so must we in parliament .
we need more transparency in this area .
they make it clear that the development of an information society must not call workers ' rights in question .
so i can only welcome today 's joint debate .
that is the question we have to ask ourselves in the course of our future work .
that is the main issue .
why ?
all well and good .
i am in agreement with the content of most of the reports .
as a result , it is no longer possible to reach any decision at all .
because what does the commission do ?
we do not expect this .
the commission now comes out with its own communication on the subject .
for there are so many aspects to the information society that we can only consider them together .
but what is the real situation in the european union ?
so what do we need ?
of course that subject is relevant to the information society too .
i am always pleased to find that she really does want to discuss the issues and does so , even if we sometimes have different views .
today they are five times as high , which is still five times too high .
i do not believe that competition is an end in itself .
some of what has been said here is simply not true .
it is quite excellent !
i never said that you do no work !
perhaps you should have another look at my last week 's report on the matter .
the debate is closed .
let me say a few words on the situation in the european union and what we expect the consumer to accept .
we are talking about consumer confidence and that is the most important thing .
they know that there has not been sufficient control in europe .
as regards control , we are all aware too that it is not sufficient in europe .
we do not need it !
we are supported in this by the majority of european farmers and the majority of european consumers .
i believe the commission must take a hard line .
there is no culture without agriculture !
why ?
we must fight against the others as well .
human health is at risk , clearly , but so too is animal health .
mr president , i should like to thank the commissioner for his statement .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , i believe we are in a difficult situation , and we are very well aware of it .
we will have to go even further than this .
we will have to consider crucial questions .
the debate is closed .
cohesion fund - structural funds
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this is why it is a good thing that the committee on the environment is also involved with regional policy , which we call the integration of the environment and other sectors .
this is why i am so pleased that a large number of our amendments have been adopted by the rapporteur and his committee .
these are matters to which cohesion policy must also pay much more attention .
this must be the practice , it must be objective .
this principle must not only apply to the cohesion fund but to regional policy as a whole .
rapporteur of the opinion of the committee on social affairs and employment .
we will not achieve this today , and must instead reform the funds one step at a time .
more decisions must be taken at a local or regional level .
there is not enough coordination within the commission either .
as regards the cohesion fund it seems clear to me that there are many points on which the european parliament and the commission agree .
through the cohesion fund good progress has been made in my country towards the objective of economic and social cohesion and it should continue to do so .
the main problem concerns what the european union is trying to achieve today with this policy of the structural funds , the policy of economic cohesion .
i believe we need one regional policy in the european union .
i think here we must support the proposals of the commissioner responsible on the future reform of the structural policies .
another point is the question of the environment .
this must remain both before and after enlargement .
the problem is that we have several principles in the eu .
i believe we must try to prevent that in time .
we must draw the necessary consequences .
but i do agree with you that a great many local environmental projects need our support .
the debate is closed .
madam president , first i want to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report .
the debate is closed .
i should also like to draw attention to another important point in connection with the accession strategy .
the question is whether that is the right road to follow .
that is an example we can only look at on the basis of own experience .
to that i can give my support .
this report could not be more clear .
in fact , investment is not possible without it .
i consider that unacceptable .
i would ask you to take note of that .
indeed we are in the process of doing so now .
only , after all these years of talk , we should finally implement it !
i can only agree with him entirely .
mr president , i have a point of order .
welcome
the next item on the agenda is the joint debate on :
the key words here are democracy and transparency .
i shall return to this in a moment .
the treaty now makes a number of provisions for progress in the field of foreign and security policy .
on the important subject of institutional reform , i would draw your attention to the reforms decided for the commission .
the single currency is extremely important , but it is not , of course , an end in itself .
this enlargement needs to be well prepared , not just by the countries concerned but also by ourselves .
major progress has also been made on the union 's internal security .
thank you , mr president-in-office of the council .
a special thank you .
the amsterdam council did the necessary .
that is the great thing .
let me start with employment , the main concern of our citizens .
all our institutions must take action , each in its own field .
now , mr president , i come to the intergovernmental conference .
that is a very good thing .
everything will come down to a question of political will .
negotiations on trade policy have been especially difficult .
very important progress has been made in two areas of direct concern to the european parliament .
( applause ) mr president , the next few years will be crucial for the future of the union .
it will present its proposals for agenda 2000 : the future of our policies , including the common agricultural policy and the structural funds , enlargement , the future financial framework .
( applause )
i call upon mrs green .
the reforms at the commission , with the new political role for the president , are a very positive development .
( applause )
however , i am still concerned regarding monetary union .
those should now be our objectives .
but we do not yet have a european political union .
who is really going to protect europe 's overall interests ?
that applies to the single currency , for example .
we need further institutional reform before the next accession .
the treaty does not measure up to all that needs to be done in the union .
( applause ) there has been some progress .
but although it was possible to take majority decisions for a whole ten years , the governments never did so !
yet they do allow for some action if the political will is there .
( applause )
why does the council feel it necessary to take a decision on this for us ?
would it not be something better left to parliament itself ?
a certain amount of progress has even been made on environment policy .
finally , a few words about the presidency as a whole .
this treaty has brought a social balance .
why ?
then we would not need another intergovernmental conference but could make considerable progress in this area .
the commission as a whole has to be approved by the european parliament .
the budget cannot be adopted against the will of the european parliament .
does this mean the end for europe ?
not in the least .
what proposals will you bring us for the budget in the future ?
or might you set up all those policies with no budget - or with the budget as it is today ?
clearly , they have not reached that point .
if europe is to be a power tomorrow , it needs to progress in both political and social affairs .
but the effect of this policy would be far greater if it were a common eu policy .
there are four points i would make here .
i heard one member this morning say that more european money needs to be provided .
it was agreed at amsterdam that an institutional review is to be carried out at a later stage , once we reach 20 member states .
so the presidency does not see any reason to change the decisions that were made at amsterdam .
the debate is closed .
it therefore has no effect on the work of this house .
mr president , you are absolutely right .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
which is why we feel as we do .
this we support .
we do not think that these two political actions will help to increase employment , growth or peace in europe .
there is not a single decision that is referred back from brussels to the member states and regions .
there is as yet no european people that is prepared to have a common european government .
and government without the people is government without democracy .
there are kind words on employment .
the framework is now in place ; a framework within which we can act .
that is not our job .
we welcome that .
we are not therefore voting for paragraph 5 .
for that reason i have voted against that resolution .
at the same time , at the economic and social levels there are one or two aspects which need to be mentioned .
that seems clear from the motion for a resolution under discussion .
we shall therefore not support it or vote for it .
but the adopted position in question only applies if a directive is to be established at community level .
it is , in fact , unacceptable for five reasons .
we must make some comment on this budget even if we are voting for the report .
we must make some comment on this budget even if we are voting for the report .
it is extremely important that the working party should deal with these problems and bring forward some proposals as soon as possible , so that they can be included in the budgetary procedure for 1998 .
it is a fundamental principle of law that the legal basis used for legislation should be as specific as possible .
however , i share the rapporteur 's concern that a further objective needs to be put into the commission 's action plan .
for all the above reasons we shall vote in favour of the political resolution approved today by parliament .
that was why i voted for it .
i share that opinion .
statement by the president
are there any comments ?
however , we will take note of your point .
it really is about time that the representatives of the council took note of that fact !
( the minutes were approved )
what kind of an example of transparency is this on the part of parliament ?
order of business
we shall now move on to establish the order of business .
mr president , i have a question that i should like to put to you concerning the agenda .
thank you .
at present , i have no reason to doubt that the commission did that .
thank you for giving me the opportunity to clear this matter up .
they should have the right to receive information about the dialogue between the member state and the commission .
i think this is something we need to look into .
we often talk about a citizens ' europe and that means different things to different people .
i have two final points .
that is very important .
that last point is a very important one to me .
this makes both the report and this debate of particular importance .
i welcome this initiative as well .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
there is no real reason for the state to be involved .
it is no different from that .
that is why we have tabled these amendments .
it is certainly not provided for by the committee 's budget .
what is the procedure ?
overall , this has been the case with the agreement that is being proposed to us .
mr president , this is the first fisheries debate since amsterdam .
this is clearly a better agreement than agreements we have had in the past .
that was in the report i referred to before .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to look at another aspect of these agreements .
the committee on budgets has now accepted three amendments to the agreement , which i would ask you to support .
this is a good agreement .
i asked the commissioner a direct question .
new member states can come in .
the debate is closed .
we have to stress both aspects .
i wish the commission every success in the further course of its work .
in reality , of course , consumer protection is something more .
that is the issue of consumer protection !
consumer protection is a question of confidence and the creation of confidence .
this applies both to the internal market and to activities in markets outside europe .
this is made clear in the green paper as well .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
very well .
are there any other comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
( the request was approved )
that is all .
that is why we need this directive .
those who want to do that should vote against the directive !
that is all .
that is why i ask for your support .
( applause )
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a serious matter .
that is what the agriculture committee wanted to prevent at all costs .
the committee will have a free vote .
certainly not .
i have to tell you that we shall be voting against this paragraph .
how are we to take a view on this ?
that is all it says !
that is the aim of the directive .
it is about the value of life .
it is about human rights .
that , i hear you say , was yesterday .
one or two questions come to mind .
it is really quite a fundamental point .
the commission and the legal affairs committee have not done that .
today we are dealing with this matter again .
that would be wrong .
that is the political decision before us .
that is why we tabled them .
to that extent the directive is also a key instrument of european employment policy .
is that actually true ?
i think that the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights has done a great job .
and it would not be for the first time either .
madam president , all that can be said on this issue has really already been said .
why ?
to that extent we find the report quite unacceptable .
i could , quite simply , end here , yet i will go one step further .
why am i doing this ?
that is why the law is there and for no other reason !
it will not be long before we reach 1998 .
this is , of course , wrong !
what then is the central question ?
thank you , commissioner .
it really does work !
i should like to express my special thanks for your contribution , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
let me make that clear .
i want to stress that this whole area needs monitoring , both by the member states and by the commission .
i do not think the motion for a resolution is entirely clear on all points .
there was no risk assessment on the use of nuclear power .
what we must ask ourselves here is this : who needs such technology ?
let me go through some of the problem areas which have been mentioned here today and which we draw attention to in the report .
i just have a few comments to make on parliament 's motion for a resolution .
once again therefore , i would like to thank parliament for its report .
the debate is closed .
thank you so much .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
madam president , on a point of order .
that is the committee 's position and i have nothing to add .
madam president , on a point of order .
they were not put before the committee .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
'
it would be better if the national states themselves establish regulations on what is acceptable , taking into account any cultural aspects .
we thus support two of the four amendments which have been tabled on the two points referred to .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this is already a problem for the application of the competition rules .
finally , let me thank my colleagues for their cooperation and support .
the point was accepted .
that point too was accepted .
what problems am i talking about ?
that is a major problem .
it is far from clear what these consequences will be .
i have a question for the commission .
i would be pleased to hear the commission 's comments on this .
mr president , colleagues , at present the most central and open question in the information society is democracy .
there cannot be a new society without democracy .
competition is completely open .
we shall take it from there .
that is the only reason .
we can only change that when we come up with european provisions .
i should now like to say a few words about the report itself .
you have also made reference - and again quite rightly so - to the rather difficult period we are currently going through .
mr president , i want to say something about amendment no 10 .
my statement is clear .
however , i should like to note the following .
the subject is of great interest to us .
the debate is closed .
the reason was that there is no legal basis .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
my question to the commission is : when can you really start work on this ?
however , this year the cooperation between the committee on agriculture and rural development and the committee on budgets has been very positive .
what were the main conclusions that we reached ?
he referred to the council several times , and i think he said that the council too was against the idea .
allow me to make a few comments on that .
agriculture is the single rural affairs policy for which the community has total responsibility .
we all know why .
of course , we cannot agree with this approach .
there is no question about that .
parliament will then have the opportunity to discuss this proposal in full .
three possible instruments are being discussed .
this is the one area where we should be able to agree .
we farmers cannot accept that .
we shall perhaps be discussing this again in a year 's time , but i do believe that this is certainly possible .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
we shall consider a number of questions to the commission .
unfortunately , as you know , it has not yet been possible to reach agreement on this convention .
does the commissioner agree ?
it is not , therefore , a new position on the part of the commission .
who will decide ?
we are discussing direct investment by one member state in another member state .
we know where it is .
we are just at the beginning .
i hope not .
thank you , commissioner , for that general response .
why ?
i thank the commissioner for his response .
the commissioner needs to address that .
i will just mention a few .
has such information been received ?
we shall have to find the best way to continue meeting needs in this area too .
however , you may answer if you wish .
i hope you will understand .
if this is the case , the commission may decide to take action .
we speak about actions by using words , but action is the key in this area .
i believe the european commission is doing much more than people are aware of .
the next item is the joint debate on :
the council 's common position has made further changes to the commission 's text .
however , there have been a number of positive developments .
these were amendments tabled by political groups .
it concerns the addition of the word ' regional ' .
i welcome these measures .
i am sure he does .
madam president , i just wanted to make a point of information to the commissioner .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i hope that you will take the same view today , commissioner .
i hope the commissioner and the house will take account of this .
however , the commission 's initiative received no response .
it is the only type of solution that will work .
there are only two points that i should like to make .
but that is precisely what we do not need at the present moment .
so this question has no place in the directive which is before us today .
the present directive cannot address that issue either .
nor can it form the basis for a common policy .
that is why we must decide what our position is to be , then the council will no longer be able to avoid the issue .
i should like to make two points to the commissioner , however .
i go along with my colleagues and think that in future we should take a quite different approach .
the conclusions are to be reached on those terms of reference by the end of this year .
it is taking no account of the social costs of its action .
this could be done at once .
that is unacceptable .
more and more people are doing the same .
i see this as an important step .
i speak both for my colleagues and myself , commissioner , in saying that we wish to see further progress on this issue too .
that is completely unacceptable .
there are three points i should like to focus on in particular .
does the commissioner see this as a job for the commission ?
i should like to hear the commissioner 's views on this , either now or at some later point .
that is one point .
madam president , i thank the commission for coming forward with this report .
therefore my amendment does not call for new regulations .
madam president , i should like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
the debate is closed .
so i agree that there is a need for common rules on transport , the environment and working time in the eu .
i can therefore support the report , which i think is good , and i congratulate the rapporteur on this first report .
we look forward to further developments .
there are a few amendments which the commission cannot accept .
the debate is closed .
welcome
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
agenda
that will do , or i shall not let you have the floor .
i wanted a debate and not a vote without a debate .
you now want a new change to be made to the agenda .
that is my first point of order .
i put to the vote the president 's proposal to change the agenda .
( parliament approved the change to the agenda proposed by the president )
mr president , i should like to refer to the rules .
it is not a rule .
so you are both right and wrong .
agenda 2000
i am not one of those who think that the european union can increase the number of its member states without any risk for its political project .
we already know that it is not enough .
we must , finally , decide what is essential and what is less so .
for some countries we have decided that this is not the case at present .
the commission will report every year to the european council on progress made .
how can that be , you ask ?
i do not doubt the will of the member states nor that of all the candidate countries .
our success , ladies and gentlemen , will be europe 's success !
i am very pleased that they are with us on this important day . important for them , but also important for us .
that is very right and proper .
it is also in our interests - in the very objective interests of the member states of the european union and of that union as a whole .
we must , of course , ask ourselves the question : what does accession cost ?
we need to be aware of that in what we do .
what will the cost of enlargement be ?
we are prepared to reform the structural funds .
never mind that .
this balance must be found .
we want and need a fundamental reform .
that is the problem that will face us during the next few years .
there was not response at the time .
thank you very much .
we , the group of the european people 's party , have always been on the side of those who want to reform the european union .
( applause )
perhaps this is what some governments would like , but not the majority in this house nor the majority of citizens .
it would quite simply be unacceptable .
i think the answer is no .
are there not certain questions we should ask ourselves here ?
there is a lot to be said about that .
i would very much like to have an answer to that from the commissioner .
obviously , we cannot accept it in these conditions .
that is the reality .
who can seriously agree with that ?
the reforms , especially the reforms of the agricultural and economic policies , do not go far enough .
the democratic rights of control held by parliament and the court of justice should be the first basis of the treaty .
the house will support you on that because it is the only serious request we can now put to the council .
i understand why we must move towards enlargement .
mr president , the commission 's proposal concerning enlargement of the union is , in my opinion , a success .
a significant change for the future of the union .
and , as far as unemployment is concerned - an issue crucial to the future of the union - the funds have not brought about any reduction in europe .
that is wrong !
that is how we have presented things .
you did not give me the floor .
we shall vote against it .
the debate is closed .
those are the reasons for my request .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
then we decided to have a vote with debate .
' .
what budget rights do we have left ?
it is just a step but not the conclusion .
we have more rights today than we have ever had .
well , today we have already had the new draft .
after serious consideration we have decided to vote against the directive while certain proposals of fundamental importance do not have the support of the majority .
when we discussed this matter two years ago i did not support the proposals - the balance was wrong .
i cannot share in this political decision , and therefore i had to vote against it .
i have voted against the report for the following reasons .
so what is the conclusion ?
i could go on .
the european parliament can have its point of view heard throughout the process .
the presidency will continue that action .
on behalf of my group i shall focus on the first two .
certainly , you have a serious commitment .
they must take part in monetary cooperation .
we need to be taking forward the single market action programme .
i wish you well .
that would be a policy against respect for the individual and against solidarity .
firstly , it must be very practical .
there too , enough scope must be allowed to put into effect at second reading what is decided at the summit .
and for that , we particularly need the social partners .
i have already said that employment policy is a national issue .
the debate is closed .
mr president , here we are again discussing turkey .
this morning we heard the commission say that it had adopted a communication on relations with turkey .
what is the response from turkey ?
that is the hope we have for the future .
we in the european union must look to the future .
no doubt we all agree on that .
turkey has been going through difficult times for some years now .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we were talking earlier today about agenda 2000 - about the future of europe .
we want to share a joint future with turkey .
we can do something different , but for that we need the will and it needs to be done quickly .
that is very important .
i very much hope that that will happen , and that turkey will play , or continue to play , its part in europe .
we want to have turkey with us in europe .
then turkey will have its place with us !
in my view that was and still is unacceptable .
the debate is closed .
the commission has provided assistance in this respect where possible in recent months .
mr president , mr president-in-office , commissioner , thank you for those reports .
but let us consider what happened during those elections .
the new authority is not yet in place .
many people are part of the government and the president of parliament and some of the ministers are not members of his party .
the guidelines that have been set are certainly positive ; i welcome the commissioner 's programme which may be positive for all .
let us have no more of that !
this is something we must all respect .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
we shall consider questions to the council .
mr president-in-office of the council , thank you for your reply .
i think however that we should do all we can now to make sure that future elections are held in more democratic conditions .
subject : road safety measures
all of that should be brought into consideration .
i hope so , madam , as soon as possible .
that is the only answer i can give you .
that was the first question .
there is no special problem for the areas which you have just mentioned .
has the foreign affairs council discussed this matter ?
this has already been done .
we know what it is like for the people .
i will follow up this question later but for now i am pleased with the response i have received from the council .
i do not think that was really a question .
i want to thank the president-in-office for his response .
that is the whole problem .
i am not sure that it will do so .
the answer has been more or less the same each time .
i welcome the comments of the president-in-office .
agenda
the elections were indeed difficult , but in the end they were accepted by everyone .
mr president , since all that needed to be said has already been said , i want to stress the following :
what has happened to the money ?
the debate is closed .
we would like to congratulate her on that .
the debate is closed .
well , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , on those three points we can now see that the overall result was positive .
let us set our course for that objective .
the debate is closed .
but they have one thing in common .
the energy sector , too , is very important .
this programme is extremely difficult to address but she has done it with great energy .
i do not know whether we are ever going to move towards that .
mr president , the report currently under discussion is excellent .
this is a level which it is possible to reach .
the debate is closed .
the question of the legal basis to be used has also been a problem .
my amendment proposal is based on the fact that no means no .
we have achieved one success .
we discussed that in committee .
let me also mention another important issue , that of monitoring the implementation of this regulation .
that would help .
but the proposal has been presented .
even after that we will be working out a compromise at second reading with the commission .
they respect the right of countries to make their own decision .
the answer is that we do not know what they think .
let me now tell the house the view the commission takes on the ten amendments .
that is not the case here .
mr president , i would like to reply to that .
the amendments we now accept would have the following effect .
the debate is closed .
environmental agreements
i shall now say why i believe that .
i believe that is right , and that we need these new instruments .
finally , may i thank the commission 's services and parliament 's services for the assistance they have given me with the production of this report .
and we know , too , that it is not enough .
many of our member states already have experience of it .
other member states have also had positive experience of these instruments .
the scope should be created for member states to implement eu legislation by using environmental agreements .
agreements can play a role here .
mr president , commissioner , environmental agreements in the european community are one thing and environmental agreements at national level are another .
i do not think so !
that must not happen .
the question of environmental agreements with industry is a difficult one .
we must clearly work further on these points on the basis of the decisions and resolutions of parliament and the council .
it is quite clear that we must agree on how to carry on with this work in the future .
does the commissioner think this is a good example of how to use these agreements at european level ?
that was my question .
the debate is closed .
it is all still there on the agenda .
i regard that in itself as a step forward .
that has nothing to do with quality of life - it 's just a waste of energy !
mr president , i should like to thank the commissioner for her speech .
we also said then that there were too many words and too little action .
we must take a positive view of the situation .
that is what matters .
i do not ask myself that as a matter of course .
just look at what has happened .
there are just a few things i want to mention in connection with what i said earlier .
on the other hand , i think it would be wrong for us to do so .
i think we should focus on the progress that has been made .
i think we should also be aware that there seems to be a will to reform the un system .
are there any comments ?
i hope members will draw the appropriate conclusions .
( the minutes were approved )
i ask the relevant parliamentary committee to state its conclusions about the matter as soon as possible .
mr commissioner , you have six months .
but why do we never hear what the others have to say ?
must it be right ?
they are only one example , and there will be many others .
because there are things that are acceptable and things that are not .
if we go down that road , there will of course never be any end to such problems .
it is good to see that it has not .
he said that the commission should do less but do it better .
but what happened ?
i look forward to further good work from him .
perhaps one of you would be able to do so .
what has the commission done ?
absolutely every one of them .
case closed .
you may feel that this is right or that this is wrong , but i have to work with objective information .
and my reply has been : ' i am aware of that fact , but i needed to know what was going on ' .
it is the commission 's business to implement that .
in any case , we should like to say than you .
the debate was necessary , but it was not the final debate .
the debate is closed .
it is true !
it is good business right now .
however , it does not go far enough .
i now move to the points being made by the committee on budgets .
i ask you to support the appropriate amendments .
' i do not think that would be very responsible .
we know , commissioner , how much you believe in the future of the rural policy .
now is the time to do something about this .
we shall vote in favour of the motion for a resolution as presented by the rapporteur and adopted by the committee on agriculture and rural development .
i therefore call upon the rapporteur to support this proposal .
in my opinion , these proposals still do not address long term policy in this sector .
i share this view .
as this is an important report , i should like it to be voted upon this morning .
it is another legislative report , after all .
i ask that my proposal be put to the vote .
the question is rather difficult .
( parliament adopted the motion for a resolution )
so i would propose - and i hope the house will follow me - that we vote in favour of my amendment .
( parliament adopted the motion for a resolution )
( parliament adopted the motion for a resolution )
that is very much open to question .
existing research and education in the field should be put to effective use .
but i still cannot support it .
the protection of our environment comes at a price , and that price must not be human !
we were wrong .
so what are we to do ?
i do not think so .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen .
the joint debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
enough is enough .
for all these reasons the will of parliament which we are going to express is very important .
i look forward to reading your answer in the minutes of the sitting .
this kind of practice is also taking place in europe .
madam president , i am going to put a different point of view .
the european people 's party will not be voting in favour of this motion .
who says anything about it ?
unfortunately , madam president , my group cannot support this resolution .
we were asked what have we done about it .
thank you very much , commissioner .
but that will not be the end of the process .
thank you , commissioner .
madam president , the motion we have tabled says it all and i do not have anything to add .
we support it .
for that reason we ask the commission :
and we come back here and say the same things every time .
so what is to be done ?
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i would therefore like to point that out .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i voted in favour of this text .
in various member states , agreements have been applied for some years now , with good results .
a number of agreements already exist at european level , and perhaps greater use could be made of this instrument .
that 's all very well : the only problem is that it is doing a great deal now that it should have done three years ago .
social dialogue
however , this also means that the european social partners must be involved .
i support the rapporteur in his questions , and in his concern at the fact that the european parliament is not involved .
this cannot continue any longer .
conditions now are completely different from what they were then .
this report is a step in the right direction .
the dialogue must , first of all , be held with the labour market partners , at a national level and , of course , at european level as well .
this is excellent .
it is only right and proper for me to mention that here .
but , commissioner , a question to you perhaps .
good !
perhaps we can then deal with both points together .
amendment to the financial regulation
what does this mean ?
thank you , commissioner .
it is up to the member states to use these funds .
yet the structural funds are in a sense a question of confidence between the eu and its member states .
this is why it is good that we have received this document from the commission .
but perhaps it is not just financial control which the structural funds need .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
its proposal then goes to the council and parliament .
we all know that doing a service to farmers means doing a service to the community as a whole .
be that as it may , however .
i think that all these aspects will have to be considered during the year when agenda 2000 is discussed .
it was not then in a position to do so .
the commission will not take up this amendment now , but will do so under the agricultural reform in agenda 2000 .
the debate is closed .
that is what was agreed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the debate is closed .
i consider this unacceptable .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
green paper on competition policy
in our view , there is good reason for this .
that is precisely the point .
in my opinion , national , regional or local rules must continue to be possible .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there is little to add to this very clear report .
it is not the commission 's aim to concern itself with this area .
these are national matters .
that is really what this is all about .
the debate is closed .
we therefore vote against paragraph 12 of the report .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
some questions still remain .
even so , it really is essential to have the means to do so !
we welcome this first stage in the process of enlargement , based on the education programmes .
the point has also already been made by many colleagues here this morning that these programmes can play an extremely important role , not least in terms of agenda 2000 .
it has not done so .
we are not in a position to do so , that is the problem .
that is why we really do need more resources .
all i can say to the council is this : what really is urgent is for you finally to give us the money to carry out this task .
we will not do so !
i should like to make two points concerning this programme .
they should not be .
in my opinion , the education programmes have already done an excellent job , and can do even more in the future .
thank you , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the council must now adopt the right order of priorities .
each country could really do with its own programme , which could be used to make progress towards the objectives .
in general terms , the unemployment rate is still a cause for serious concern .
after discussion in committee , he has in fact accepted all the amendments i tabled on behalf of my group .
everyone is well aware that we have reached a key point in regional policy .
for my part , there are two comments i should like to make .
thank you , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i have therefore voted in favour of this motion .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
here too , clear progress has been made .
that is why the committee on external economic relations can support the commission 's proposals .
we therefore call for the report and the amendments to be adopted .
of course , if the debate must take place , then it must take place , and the vote will come later .
that in fact is the point on which i should like to speak .
the rapporteur in fact made that point just a little while ago .
mr president , perhaps i will be allowed my speaking time after all !
and we call this support for economic reform in these countries !
this is a fundamental issue which i believe we must address .
once again , mr president , thank you for the time i have been able to take for this final contribution .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i have already said that i support this request .
mr president , there are two comments i should like to make .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
welcome
order of business
mrs green has the floor to move the request .
so , we would ask that it comes forward .
( parliament agreed to the request )
the debate has already taken place in committee .
what is the wrong with this subject ?
i shall now put the request to a vote .
mrs green has the floor to move the request .
this is a very important issue .
( parliament approved the request )
that has not been done .
no group , including your own , has put in a request .
so , under the rules , i cannot put it to a vote .
mrs green has the floor to move the request .
mr president , i have a question .
does the group making the request agree ?
( no change )
then there is the consumer 's right to information .
a number of provisions have also been included in this regard , which i am very pleased about .
i congratulate the rapporteur once more .
i expect the commission will now make a proposal on time .
i would like to draw your attention to two matters .
to some extent we already have such a thing , but more are needed .
so we can look at them at the same time .
the debate is closed .
i believe that the problem is more serious .
they need a different approach , more appropriate help , more support and more special measures .
i have not heard anything specific and here is a specific programme and the council of ministers does not wish to provide any money for it .
what a programme for so little money !
have we done well ?
the question can again be asked today .
that will not do , and that will not do for the coming years !
the debate is closed .
cohesion policy and culture
this can be done through the enlargement mentioned earlier .
the report is positive too .
mr president , i should like to thank the rapporteur for his hard work on this report .
i can give her more information on that later .
this fact will have to be considered during the reform of regional policy which is currently in progress .
here too , i believe , one should look back after a certain period on what one has achieved .
once again my thanks to the parliament .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen .
we shall not do that at this second reading .
i would like to draw attention to two more points .
in a common market we need common regulations .
there was found little support from the commission for this at first reading .
that must not be allowed to happen in the european union .
in this situation , i feel it is important for the directive to be accepted as quickly as possible .
i should like , however , to make my position on this matter quite clear .
we have now created pressure additional to what would have happened in any case .
that is possible , but with these guidelines it is not yet possible .
but at any rate a framework has been created in which it could be possible in the future , and for that reason i am not against it and i can accept the rapporteur 's amendment .
naturally you can always accept these amendments .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
the next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
that is why this debate is so important .
but my question is : ' now what ?
mr president , at last a significant morning to deal with a significant issue ! and one which concerns all european union citizens , not just the women .
a little has happened , but it is far from enough .
we have said it all before .
that is the current debate .
and action is what is needed !
it will not implement itself .
so the action the european commission has taken is all the more necessary , and i have every respect for it .
but it will be more difficult in practice .
so positive action indeed .
i think the structural funds should be used where they are needed , not just as a matter of principle .
i would make this more specific .
we are now talking about two important reports .
secondly , the structural funds , which have already been mentioned here several times .
it has been very well received and i am very pleased with that .
this is something we are going to work on and which will be further developed in the future .
that is something we should certainly pay very close attention to .
i am very concerned about this .
your contribution in this respect is very important .
the joint debate is closed .
violence against women
mr president , there are not many people here , but that does not mean that this issue does not concern a great number of people .
what is the cause and what is the effect ?
but we now know that it is not .
we have discussed it several times .
we do not have much money to deal with such a serious problem , but we will try to get the budget increased for next year .
i do not think that is the real answer .
a structural approach is necessary .
and there is also a great deal about violence in that un convention .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there is no doubt that violence is also an issue that must be considered by women .
this is really serious .
much more needs to be done .
i would like to thank her for a very good report .
i would also like to make a few comments on the next report .
it would have become them .
mr president , violence against women is a major social problem .
it is an important report .
of course , this is also important at european level .
we now have a number of projects under way in the stop programme .
we will soon be able to start projects to support women and children who have become victims of violence .
obviously , the need is great .
the debate is closed .
' .
women 's rights are human rights .
as i said , women consumers have considerable power .
but we in parliament also have considerable responsibility .
i think we can continue to make progress in that way .
this is a european matter .
perhaps !
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i am going to vote against this document .
the european parliament has come out in favour of a key text on the future of public services in europe .
i have voted for the report .
these are amendments which we would naturally have supported .
draft budget for 1998
i shall begin with agricultural expenditure .
i now come to the field of structural actions .
the council 's decisions in this field are based on the following principles .
for my part , mr president , i thank you for giving me the floor , and for your attention .
mr president-in-office , i should like to comment on some of the points you raised . first , agricultural policy .
a third point . you have had a field day in that 20 % of the expenditure is where you wanted it , just as it is every year .
mr president , parliament cannot take that line . nor can we take it at the first reading of parliament 's budget .
( applause from the left )
so far so good .
the same goes for social actions .
( applause from the right )
( applause from the left )
i shall certainly be here .
the debate is closed .
we want a little more effort from the commission on this problem .
this decision is unacceptable .
this is not the position of our group .
so first our cooperation and development policy is called into question .
it was also one of the conditions of the common market .
our budget policy is called into question .
that is true .
it is essential .
we want to play our part .
why has this happened ?
that is simply not so .
every possible effort must be made to provide help if the changes go through .
and , we must , of course , continue to the end to give every possible support to those people who are the victims of this decision .
and , if possible , we would also like to know the commissioner 's views .
it is important for the very reasons that we want member states of the eu to respect eu rules .
but it does not .
he is no doubt right .
that is not the answer for those countries .
the debate is closed .
we are now on another item .
a number of important points are at issue here .
as far as i know , this programme is being implemented with due regard to the content of the relevant council decision .
that is something we have to come to terms with .
we cannot expect it be done in five minutes .
unfortunately , that is the situation .
the year 2000 is very close .
that is the essential point , mr commissioner .
question time ( commission )
we will take questions to the commission .
i believe that is very important .
the three institutions actually reached agreement on that in the end .
we are certainly going to pay particular attention to this matter .
i should like to tell the honourable member that i am extremely aware of the matter she has raised , and i share her concerns .
that is a very long way off .
i want to show you that there is no lack of interest on the part of the commission .
that is her right .
which are they ?
i can mention one case which has been made public by the companies concerned .
you are right .
it is not that there was no competition from other companies .
that was a decision made by the government .
subject : government aid
now i come to my conclusion , and to two points .
therefore the question should perhaps have been put to the council of ministers .
secondly , i would like to say that i cannot answer for the council of ministers .
it is the council of ministers which is responsible for this .
it was in the council of ministers that this was adopted , and it was not at the commission 's request .
from the commission 's point of view we shall therefore provide as much help as we can .
i thank the commissioner for her answer , which was quite excellent .
i am very pleased with the answer and with the work which the commissioner presented , but i have two questions in connection with this .
'
thank you , commissioner for taking this question .
i accept , as you said , that the role of member states in this matter is crucial .
anything more than that comes within the authority of member states and their legislation .
member states must also be responsible to this authority .
thank you for your answer mr commissioner .
that is just for your information .
just how difficult this is can be seen from the question that we have put to the commission today .
if we do not help them , what will happen ?
you need to be clear on what you want .
what is the problem we face today ?
these things concern all of us .
we therefore do not have very much time left for discussion .
the debate is closed .
clearly there is a lot that can be done in europe .
madam commissioner , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , today much is being said about employment .
so we can do something for education and research .
i have also found them in the commission document and in the excellent report by the rapporteur .
and you know that in this field there is much that needs to be done .
the debate is closed .
industry is behind it .
well , i am pleased to hear that the commission is taking the matter forward at last - at last - but not far enough !
why has the commission not done it ?
for this they need our financial and technical support .
the european union should , as already agreed , lead with a good example here .
perhaps the commission could just have a better look at this matter .
yet others again have raised questions about the current situation on the application of community legislation in the various member states .
the joint debate is closed .
we do not know what was discussed and what guidelines were adopted at the previous meeting .
but we have to use them in the right way .
there is one thing that is of interest to the united states ; there is the other which is of interest to us .
i should like to know the opinion of the commissioner on these two questions .
at least a significant number of developing nations must vote for it , in order for such an agreement to be made at all .
we have been very successful .
let us start from first principles .
what are our objectives ?
i had two questions .
you did not answer them .
that is the answer to your first question .
we are quite a long way from it but we have made some progress .
this is one point on which concern has been expressed by my colleagues .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
madam president , on a point of order .
( applause )
madam president , on a point of order . it concerns the rules of this house .
we will see .
i would like an answer now !
what can the commission do ?
this is how i understand what you have said and should like to offer you my full support on behalf of my group .
we must therefore express a hope and find a way of discussing the issue .
the hope is clear .
so , within this framework , what are the powers of parliament ?
firstly , it is good to be able to say that we - council , commission and parliament - all express the same views .
the individual states will not be involved , the council will not be involved , the commission will not be involved .
this is what parliament 's contribution could be .
when a country goes through such a crisis , it is very difficult for a government to follow good policies .
that is my first point .
people talk about dialogue .
it may be so .
and the question we have to address is what we can do .
i believe that we need to talk and to support dialogue .
finally , colleagues , i should like to point out our own responsibility in this debate .
i hope parliament will also be able to support this .
our common effort will therefore take a long time .
the debate is closed .
of course this will not happen .
in addition there are other , more specific , proposals .
these are two extremely important issues .
people who trade with each other should also speak to each other .
that can obviously not be the case .
the least that can be said is that if it is necessary , it is certainly not sufficient .
let me give an example .
i would like to put a question before i end , mr president .
these things have to be said at the present time and parliament will have to come to a conclusion because it has a role to play in this process .
those two countries in particular should be brought to task , not only by the united states but also by the united nations and by the european union .
the european union certainly has a role to play .
this is the price of world peace .
success is possible , if a security committee is first of all created .
the debate is closed .
i hope the commission will be able to accept these amendments , as indeed they accepted many of the first reading amendments .
on the main points , we are in agreement .
mr president , this is all i wanted to say .
i would like to thank once again both the commission and the rapporteur for the excellent work which they have done to date .
the most important thing now is for the matter to progress .
development opportunities are what are needed today .
it is right that the member states should be allowed to decide in what way various special groups should be taken into consideration , either through tax policy or social services .
if this proposal goes through , i do not believe that there would be the same interest in developing quality .
we also support the data protection aspect .
to begin with , i would state that the council of ministers has adopted a number of important amendments from the european parliament and those tabled by the european people 's party at first reading in particular .
so that means we must take those changes into account .
the debate is closed .
you did not .
unfortunately , i must say that i do not agree with all of the conclusions reached .
we must also say quite clearly , and i should like to stress this to the commission , what we do not want .
that is an absolutely essential principle .
there are only six amendments in all .
mr president , mr commissioner , i do not think there are going to be any problems with this document .
mr president , i find i can fully support this report .
a great deal of excellent work has been done .
i fully share that view .
amendments nos 1 and 3 are acceptable in full .
the debate is closed .
i will therefore try to present his report to you .
this is the reason for my amendment motion .
but that costs money .
how difficult it will be to change this situation !
we have to demand that governments really do keep the international agreements .
' .
and finally , i would like to thank you for the debate here today .
the debate is closed .
i put the question .
on an economic level , the situation is on balance positive .
we know quite well what is possible on the environment within the wto .
this is the reality !
the question was also raised of how have we come to make the progress we have made and what further progress is there to be made .
as to the future , progress still needs to be made .
that is always the case and always will be .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but now to more serious matters .
but i cannot find anything really clear about it there .
unfortunately , though , there is no legislation here .
but this is not to be found in the current legislation .
- and costs .
to demand another directive , as the rapporteur does , i consider to be going too far .
i therefore support the commission in this case .
do we need , in fact , a legislative act , and if so , when and with what content ? we cannot answer this question at the moment for two reasons .
we have said this for each legislative act .
they do not have to do this ; if they want to be difficult they can even be that .
but as i have said , up to now we have had no such case .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
investment was thus one subject on the agenda .
as they deal with the same subject , questions nos 3 and 4 will be taken together .
it is therefore quite essential and a question of democracy to be able to know what it is that is to be decided on .
yesterday i discussed the same question on the right of asylum with the commission , which was prepared to discuss this question even though it is the council which has taken the decision .
i therefore expect an answer to the question .
i am concerned to say the least .
i believe the same can be said of many others .
subject : eu structural funds
thank you for your answer .
it will be included in objective area 1 .
i would like to thank the president-in-office for a very full answer .
i would like to thank the president-in-office of the council for that excellent answer , but i have just a few things i would like to ask him about .
how are our trade relations with the area developing ?
i believe that you used terms like " call on ' , ' demand an answer ' and so on .
subject : development of democracy in europe
i was one myself a few years ago .
i think we are agreed on this .
thank you for your proposal .
i would like to thank the president-in-office for his very full answer .
i do not know .
nevertheless , as far as i know , the problem has not yet been raised .
subject : respect for social standards
did this meeting take place ?
mr president-in-office of the council , thank you for your answer .
these changes demand a response . we have to know what we actually want to change in these areas .
that cannot be in the interests of the internal market and its growth .
there are quite a few of them .
with the euro everyone can get involved .
but this sector should be given a due amount of attention .
it took years before the commission even wanted to talk to this sector .
the question is , what is this instrument for and who is it for ?
it is a very important contribution to this debate .
i do too .
but is more trade better ?
the green paper , mr commissioner , has therefore not come too soon and especially not as there is now quite a lot of movement in this sector .
in any case , i hope that the commission will take account of the parliament 's resolution .
mr president , i understand .
we are now at the stage at which we draw our conclusions and your report is indeed an important contribution in this process .
with small companies , the situation is not the same .
i should like to know the commissioner 's view on that point .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i just wanted to draw attention to it .
this is simply an agreement , which was not made today .
( parliament approved the minutes )
i should like to thank the member states of our union for the efforts they have made to achieve this result .
and we have come a long way , it is true .
thus we are still a long way from that single internal area of freedom , security and justice .
furthermore , this is an international convention .
then why have we said that this is a step forward ?
the two points concern the powers of the european court of justice .
my parliamentary group will not vote for this report , for the reasons given .
this is not for the first time either .
in my view these points have all been rightly made .
this concerned the question of political crime .
that is only fair .
i believe she was here this week .
i am in agreement .
so what should the european parliament do now ?
mr president , first of all we should congratulate the rapporteur for the quality of her report , although some comments are called for .
several members and myself are going to vote against this report .
that is our view .
we are well aware of this in my country , which is why we have wanted this convention for a long time .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it has many good things to say .
i should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my group on his work .
my group is voting in favour of this report .
this is a project that we as a parliament must support .
which is very different from doing something new !
finally , we would like to support what other members have already said .
this is certainly in order .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is one of the key questions .
nevertheless , mr president , mr commissioner , at this moment there is a greater issue .
mr president , there is one thing i cannot understand .
i will only accept points of order .
i am not going to deal with the question , because this is not the time for questions .
this is an important discussion .
in the committee on agriculture there was considerable amendment to the commission 's proposal .
that simply must be discussed .
mr president , on a point of order .
the request to close the debate will now be put to the vote .
as a result i am able also to vote for amendments nos 4 and 12 .
for this reason the commission cannot agree to them .
the commission is prepared , however , to accept amendment no 11 .
we will now move to the vote .
that is the particular situation .
so i ask you mr president , to allow this .
this was an important point in the committee on agriculture !
it is not the first time this has happened , by the way .
thank you , and welcome to the house !
will the commissioner give us an answer or not ?
welcome
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we agree .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the commission 's new proposal is a step in this direction , and will therefore have my vote .
there are other values which must be taken into consideration before the wto makes decisions , including the environmental effects .
but as i said , on this issue i think that the wto has made the right decision .
that is why i voted in support of the joint resolution .
all these issues are giving considerable cause for concern .
that is something i cannot accept .
regarding the current state of these relations , i share the opinion of the committee 's rapporteur .
what is needed is a joint plan of economic action for the common interest of both working people and consumers .
no , of course , not !
and this is what is involved .
we have therefore voted no to the report .
that is what this text says .
if people agree with you , and there are perhaps many members who do , the conclusion is that they must vote against .
this was discussed . this is what it says .
if you do not like this , then you should vote against it .
what is the result ?
absolutely nothing .
the european union 's resolutions are clear .
the joint debate is closed .
the last point in the resolution is that we , the european countries , should make a lot of money available .
that was not good .
now they know that it can be different , that every vote is important .
i think we should note that this step towards elections was a very important one towards making this country achieve of peace .
there were problems , however .
what must happen ?
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i have a question i hope the commissioner can answer .
secondly , how far will the reforms go ?
the european parliament has both the authority and the power , and the necessary financial and human resources to achieve this .
what can the european union do about this situation ?
for just this very reason our resolution today is so important .
madam president , on a point of order .
madam president , on a point of order .
that is my first point .
that was the compromise proposal .
it did no such thing !
i think we can discuss that again at the end of the debate .
we shall have three minutes for it .
madam president , i have two very short and relevant points to make .
we shall return to the other matter later .
unfortunately that did not work .
i do ask you to consider that .
that cannot be in the interests of our parliament .
i believe it is absolutely essential for us to express clearly what we stand for in this .
we must speak of human rights , we must stand up for them ; in other words , we must accept the consequences of being the european union and the european parliament .
how far will they go ?
that is another concern .
how will they develop ?
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
this was a hope which has now unfortunately come to nothing .
we are very pleased that agreement has been reached .
there is certainly still a task to be carried out in europe .
that can be seen from the resolution and the amendment resolutions to it .
the ban will also have different effects in different countries .
the debate is closed .
the european union also has a role in this .
the right hand has to know what the left hand is doing .
thank you , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that means that germany must have a share of at least 20 % .
but first we must ask one question .
he will consider the matter .
we naturally support this position .
we should support them .
some do , but not all .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
this morning we have them in four .
mr president , yesterday a very important decision was taken .
( parliament approved the minutes )
i agree with you entirely .
all right .
this was the whole point .
i do not want to see it held up any further .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we want to deal with this here in parliament , and i hope that will happen at second reading .
in the past , parliament has quite rightly asked the commission to provide it with some information about how this system is working .
there is support for it today , as well .
enough about that for today .
because what will happen then ?
for these reasons we will vote in favour of this amendment .
' .
i could not agree that there is any need for that .
there is no need to have any other system .
my group did not agree with me at the time .
the second question is agricultural production and its importance , even more than before , in view of world markets .
in this very debate it has become clear once again how important it is for us to have a common european currency .
as soon as we have a european currency , that can no longer happen .
i think we should welcome this report and the resolution .
the debate is closed .
i wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report .
i wish to show by this that the budget problems will continue to exist as long as the commission does not close up the " open end ' .
are there any comments ?
we will draw the consequences of the situation according to our rules of procedure when the time comes , but we are not going to discuss it now .
( the minutes were approved )
mr president , i wish to bring a very important matter to your attention .
she does not need our help , but if she did , we would give it .
request for procedure without debate
urgent political matters
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this morning the commission adopted these reports on employment , along with proposals on guidelines for member states ' employment policies .
we have come a long way in this direction .
we are all agreed that we are talking about the number one priority .
we know that the necessary changes are structural in nature and we know what we have to do .
in fact , everything has been said .
now it is time to act .
we will thus have created 12 million new jobs .
some would say this is a high price to pay .
much has been said on the importance of our efforts in research and development .
but what is the reality ?
mr president , the social partners , too , have every interest in the success of the necessary changes .
mr president , i am coming to my conclusion .
mr president , i believe that with today 's proposals we are taking the member states at their word .
i have two questions .
regarding your second question about whether the council will follow our lead , my answer is that we hope so .
i have mentioned the difficulties with regard to this summit .
i mentioned the social partners .
finally , mr president , what proposals are you going to put forward for reforms in the longer term ?
both the previous commission and the current commission have made proposals on this .
we have not yet reached that point .
this is what the amsterdam summit asked us to do ; to regard unemployment and job creation as a matter of common concern .
from the community budget , from the private sector , or from national budgets ?
what does the commission think ?
secondly , what about industry 's responsibility ?
why not turn this proposal into a future programme ?
this is quite a good idea .
in particular , we are talking about those who have never had the opportunity for training .
in fact , quite a lot of things have been done in the recent past .
this is the communication that i have put to you this morning .
employment policy has become a major political issue for the european union . it is indeed the number one priority .
that is why i ask you this question .
that is quite right .
the debate is closed .
we welcome that .
welcome
but i would also like to say something positive .
( applause from the left )
that is a good thing .
but it must also be clear that we only form part of a global approach .
we cannot accept that any longer .
as the resolution states , there is still a great deal left to do .
the commission must find out about this as soon as possible in cooperation with the member states .
i want the commission to reply to this too .
our information points in that direction .
the debate is closed .
let us now come to the report on the agenda .
that is a good thing .
that must change .
i would now like to turn to some environmental issues .
two sectors in which there will be the most job opportunities in the future .
there are two aspects i want to mention .
both are victims of the system .
i will return to that point in a moment .
i would like to mention just a few areas .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 am .
economic and monetary union
the best guarantee for the future of social security because it will in future allow more funds to be made available for social security .
secondly : employment .
what can europe do ?
our task here is not so great .
there are three important instruments .
that is why we need job creation in the european union .
we do not think that the market can rule everything .
we believe that the state has a role to play and that the social partners have an important role to play .
the result is the same .
each european country has something to offer the european model .
perhaps this is the only conclusion we can agree on today .
but the rapporteur does not do that .
finally , this report is out of date .
there is a fundamental last question .
if it happened at all , it would take a very long time , i know that much .
that is absolutely not enough as far as i am concerned !
i think that is important .
i am very pleased that you were able to say those words during your speech .
thank you .
that is where have to start .
the euro is not an end in itself .
the euro must be an instrument of growth and employment .
it must also be a guarantee of our social security system .
the debate is closed .
firstly , a basic problem .
finally , the last problem is one of procedure .
unfortunately we cannot avoid this .
the commission is very pleased that this important last step has been taken so that the community can quickly become a party to this convention , following the example of the majority of its member states .
the debate is closed .
a new approach based on european law is required .
i believe that this report takes account of real developments in the european community .
we can do without that !
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the european union is still a long way from being a political union .
welcome
i would like to comment on another point in addition to what we have already heard .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
thank you .
today , unfortunately , the situation is completely different .
our relations cannot just carry on as they are .
why did they not work ?
from this point of view , the comments of the rapporteur of the committee on foreign affairs , security and defence policy are very important .
i think he did the right thing .
i also have a few more questions for the commission , much as i am pleased with this treaty .
thank you president .
we have the budget .
now we have to make the political decision whether to use it .
well , of course , that is the aim of all our cooperation agreements .
that is not the way things work .
why did it not work ?
i just think that this is important in the light of the current debate .
what is your position in this specific case , which could of course happen ?
what are we doing about this problem ?
in other words , there is no problem in this respect .
you know better than i that as yet the european union has no external responsibility in financial matters .
this is a debate for the future .
my question is why this european union project did not work .
the debate is closed .
with this opinion of the committee on foreign affairs , security and defence policy , we move that this house should vote in favour .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
my third comment concerns civil society .
we can but say that this was a special programme .
it should also remain special programme .
therefore on the final vote i shall be voting against the resolution .
i therefore ask , ladies and gentlemen , that you give it the necessary attention today .
this is particularly true in terms of agricultural issues .
thank you !
it is another world .
i shall point out three things in particular on which i place great importance .
the aim must therefore clearly be supported .
these efforts must be supported and we must ask other authorities to do the same .
finally , it has to be said that human and social development must , in all cases , be the framework for our actions .
thank you , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
transport of live animals
that is for a number of reasons .
in the first place , it is a fact that some five member states still have not fully implemented it in their national legislation .
it is also not good for the consumer .
therefore this report requires that a clear end be made to this .
it is a subject , therefore , that matters to many , many people .
so it does not happen .
so , from this point of view it is a positive development .
the law must be put into practice in every country and the commission has responsibility for monitoring the process , and making demands on member states in that respect .
and we still allow this to happen today !
that takes place every day .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for a good report and a good initiative .
unfortunately , it is an initiative report and not legislative .
we need action in this area .
i wish to stress four points .
legislation on animals transport must be implemented .
we often discuss the people 's europe but here is a subject that has been raised by three million people .
i am , however , quite sure that we will need new commission regulations .
the present regulations , although not even fully implemented , do not go far enough .
i think that would be one way .
in reality not very much has happened .
they should be implemented as soon as possible .
now i come to the main problem .
it also concerns the committee on agriculture and the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection who have been asked for their opinion .
i now look forward to the commission 's proposals !
the debate is closed .
( parliament approved the request )
i would ask if the house would support that .
i hope that is clear .
there are not .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
there are not .
on amendment no 4
there are not .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
and again wish him every success in his new position in the court of justice .
i therefore call on members to vote in favour of this amendment .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we can support the word ' monitoring ' but not ' control ' .
in fact they should no longer be there .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is something i cannot accept .
the eu is not a state .
in the light of this , i have voted against the report .
foreign policy is the responsibility of the member states , after all .
programmes that promote human rights should be given priority by the union and the member states .
however , it is necessary to stress the point relating to human rights more clearly than the report does .
the debate , however , must not end there .
i cannot support that policy .
there is no way that that would create any social security for the citizens .
at first , nothing .
we shall therefore vote against the report .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work .
for all these reasons , i fully support my colleague 's report .
i congratulate the rapporteur .
i am not sure that all the consequences have been considered .
we of course voted against this point .
i consider these three points to be of great importance .
if they become reality , i think it should be possible to avoid many of the problems which exist today .
on the whole , the report is good , and i have therefore voted for it .
i agree completely with this statement .
are there any comments ?
this issue concerns me too .
what is this all about ?
everyone is fully aware of that .
they had one aim and were prepared to use any means to achieve it .
well , no , mr president , that is by no means that !
several people want to speak .
we simply will not stand for it .
we support them all , of course .
that is something special .
a debate has already been held on the procedure .
mr president , i have two comments .
we ask only one thing and that is that this house should set things right itself .
that is what i ask parliament as a whole .
mr president i shall make no addition to this debate .
i am not going to get involved in the debate .
( the minutes were approved )
so , mr president , i put two questions to you .
the following amendments have been proposed .
this issue is included in the debate on urgent issues .
why ?
but in fact it can .
i am therefore in favour .
mrs green may now move the request .
mr president , i should also like to support the proposal .
( parliament approved the request )
we are all equal before the law .
we are all equal in questions of justice .
in this case we should instead follow the proposal made by the rapporteur .
that is what has happened to him !
that is precisely the question raised by the two reports .
the debate is closed .
the objectives of this are quite clear .
we should support the commission 's initiative .
i believe the commission can play a strong role in that respect .
it is therefore very difficult to know where to draw the line in this area .
however , let me now draw attention to a number of aspects which are not being given due consideration .
i am sure that parliament and the commission will do what is necessary .
this is not my decision , but rather one for the union as a whole .
now to the member states .
the debate is closed .
but to what extent can this really be considered a success ?
i therefore call upon all members to vote for the proposal .
that is not so .
our strategy was clear - more money for research .
i do not agree with him that it is the best possible result .
yet we are doing nothing to change it .
we did not get the agreement across the political groups that we should have had for such an important issue .
however , one may as well support it , since it is better than nothing at all .
this is not just parliamentary talk .
i therefore believe that the best policy is to accept this deal .
that is not acceptable , obviously .
the debate is closed .
there are a few other , less important , amendments .
therefore , i call upon this house to support the amendments which have been approved by the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights .
this is a very important report .
so we are talking about something of economic importance in this directive .
then there is the consumer issue .
i ask myself : is this really a council position or is it the position of one or two member states ?
so the position is now very clear .
what of the consequences for employment ?
and this is a price which european consumers will have to pay .
it is our task here in parliament to ensure that the internal market is carried into effect .
madam president , i very much welcome the commission proposal and would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work .
i therefore support the commission proposal and the amendments adopted by the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights .
madam president , we are at second reading !
now the matter is going through second reading in parliament and we say that we did not mean to take things quite so seriously .
all the same , these are just high court decisions !
this will happen if we do not accept what parliament has already decided and what the commission has already proposed .
of course we do not want this .
the council did not accept these proposals .
thank you , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
but i do want to thank you .
there can be few matters as important as that .
he said that this was an internal matter .
mr president , on the same point .
it is most certainly an issue for this parliament to consider .
clearly , the next vote may change that decision .
( the minutes were approved )
mr president , this is without doubt an important issue .
i put the request for urgent procedure to a vote .
european council on employment
it is time to say what europe can and must do .
let me say a few words about the proposals in my report .
he or she has a job or is on a training course .
here again cooperation by the social partners is essential .
i do not really understand why they have such a problem with this .
this is not the case in the area of employment .
union action is not the same as that of the individual states .
that is essential .
that is what this summit is about .
it is better to review it again each year .
a final point about the structural funds .
what is different now ?
but what are the means proposed ?
the means exist to do this .
this applies to social and labour market policy and to employment policy .
nor do i find it in the debate we are having here today .
it is not - at any rate , not where i come from .
but work is part of that quality of life !
we know that to do this we must make the single market work .
but that money will only be made available to the summit if the national governments are prepared to take it seriously .
the report does not go far enough , though .
it is important to act now .
nor does the report pay enough attention to jobs in the public service sector .
there are many good proposals in this report which i am going to support .
the summit really needs all the help and all the good proposals it can get , since it has a very , very difficult task .
madam president , first of all i wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
it is important to face up to these problems in a positive way .
equal job opportunities for women have still not been achieved .
great !
but how and who is going to pay for it ?
i have tabled an amendment on that point .
and after all that is also important .
the question is , are you in a position to change policy ?
the implementation of these measures is the responsibility of each member state .
madam president , i should like to thank the president-in-office of the council , the president of the commission and the rapporteur for their comments today .
i would like to make one point , however , in the hope that the summit will adopt it .
so it is a good thing it is now high on the agenda .
finally , the ten project .
but now we do not see them at our side on the issue of a true employment policy .
of course we need economic growth .
first , we need high quality , sustainable employment opportunities .
secondly , we need more jobs for women .
i could not have put it better and i entirely agree .
i hope , mr president-in-office , that the summit will be successful in this respect .
madam president , with the amsterdam treaty we have taken a great step towards a better europe .
now there are these instruments in the amsterdam treaty .
let us now do the same thing for employment and unemployment .
we can clearly see that we must change course .
that is possible .
this is not the europe we want .
it is now or never !
this will be a priority following the summit 's conclusions in 1998 .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the compromise is not really a success for the european parliament .
i want to discuss this last point today .
i want to congratulate them on that . so what should we expect from this summit ?
to what level ?
and when ?
there are so many fundamental questions .
why not 5 % , even 3 % ?
of course we must reduce unemployment .
to do this , europe of course has its role to play , and the euro will be a great help .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , this is a joint debate on a number of reports .
i will just make one comment on the report for which i am the rapporteur .
a major initiative for this year is that on employment .
it is very important that on internal policy we have made a beginning on real information policy .
it is up to the commission now to take action .
it is up to parliament to be quite clear on how it will carry out control .
i hope we will continue this line in the coming years .
he has done the best he could with the available resources , and this is the result .
under these conditions we are prepared to agree to the commission 's proposal and indeed have included it in our own proposal .
we have tabled an amendment to this effect .
the 1998 budget will then be another success for the european parliament .
there are a number of other things in the budget of parliament .
let me now come to the opinion of my group on the other reports under discussion .
this is the task of the agenda 2000 programme , which we will again be discussing in the future .
we look forward to a statement from the commissioner .
if member states are serious about things like job creation , let them put this money into that .
the most important aspect as far as social policy is concerned was the employment initiative .
on behalf of the committee on social affairs and employment i very much welcome this development .
i believe that it is right to have a green structural policy , and in the years to come the agricultural policy should also be made green .
we hope that this will be considered during the vote .
they must be put right by the commission .
welcome
this debate will therefore take place at a later stage .
but as far as the principles are concerned , we fully share them .
at times we have done things with which i did not agree .
that should be given full support from all groups .
that is a first , so far as i know .
it has shown that it has been working .
obviously we cannot but agree that priority should be given to employment .
the importance of this priority required much more of us .
we agree with these objectives , but we do not agree with the means used to include them .
now it is up to the commission .
but that was then , and i do not think it is going to work this time .
it is the result of a great deal of work . i shall therefore vote in favour of it this time , which i did not do in committee .
that is all i want to say on the matter .
ladies and gentlemen , i come now to the general budget .
i think that is very clear .
unfortunately , mr president , i must stop .
thank you .
that is a good move .
that is why we need regulations .
the same work , the same pay , everyone the same .
we should also have that for ourselves .
we must have regulations .
that is an important problem but it is only one aspect .
the joint debate is closed .
the green paper is a policy paper .
what can we do in the short term ?
this aspect of the amendment should not create any difficulties for my colleagues .
this is a global market in which we work .
several new cases are in progress .
this is only information about when nothing has been done .
it is therefore important that we should address ourselves to this matter .
what are the commission 's proposals here ?
those are our party objectives .
in fact , we consider this issue is not relevant here .
does anything happen ?
no !
they may also have importance for the solution to environmental problems at union level .
we here in parliament must be able to do something about these problems .
so there are many questions that the european commission needs to answer .
what is the commissioner going to do about it ?
so when are the sectors to be discussed ?
we should also ensure that the current regulations meet market requirements .
however , this does not mean that aspects of environmental policy cannot and should not be taken into consideration .
the debate is closed .
for the purpose of our objectives , this is often enough .
this seems a lot to me .
it perhaps has information that we do not .
the debate is closed .
i therefore call upon you to give it your support .
that is something that to which in my view the commission should give a little more consideration .
mr president , a lot has already been said .
it is a good way of working .
we will never be able to do that .
i welcome the support which parliament can give us to get these important instruments in place .
i hope that the council will address these problems .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
there is no such proposal as the one referred to by the honourable member of parliament in the question concerned .
the same is true for some other member states .
i am pleased that this is only ' under consideration ' since it is a question of very great importance for consumers in europe .
can we expect a proposal from the commission some time during next year , or is it further into the future ?
it is under consideration for the time being .
we feel that this needs to be discussed and must lead to a conclusion by the commission at the end of this process .
monitoring of the proper implementation of these provisions is the responsibility of member states .
the project is also part of a scientific research programme .
'
they had absolutely no connection with the social economy sector .
subject : nuclear safety
i thank the commissioner for that reply .
according to our information , the return systems are still working extremely well .
nevertheless , the question concerned two issues :
this could be for various reasons .
the community has no powers to act in this field .
but we will certainly do as you say .
subject : unemployment in the european union 's service sector
such assistance and support is available .
that is all i can say .
but we would wish that they would share best practice that is available and we try and make that available to them .
i wish it were not so and i look forward to the day when it will not be so .
however , you are quite right and i support you .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
you are left to make up your own mind .
we should for this reason support the agreement .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have here two agreements which i consider to be extremely important .
there is not much to say on the subject .
that is one point .
the second point is that both these agreements must be put to the vote .
unfortunately , it was never implemented .
it should be said that an economic agreement is already in force which has given it a great hand , but there is a well developed private initiative .
what will happen ?
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
the services will take note of your point .
i will not have a debate on the matter .
mr president , this is about the same problem .
( the minutes were approved )
i understand the rules are quite clear .
very well . i take note of your point , and i shall give you reply as soon as possible .
i said that to all your colleagues .
this is the course to follow , and this is the direction that relations between parliament and the commission have been taking in practice .
thank you .
( applause ) we have to act , and act together .
there will be no group negotiations .
that is not acceptable .
those who want peace , want europe .
some people ask if we really need a directive at european union level .
mr president , what is the state of the union ?
a large number of countries will be in this first group .
i think we must be involved in this vital issue .
of course we also have to put our own house in order .
finally i want to mention two areas in which we have a particular interest in cooperation between the institutions .
he said that europe is peace .
that was the great hope : to become european .
i hope that this debate between the three political institutions of the union will help achieve that .
agenda 2000 and enlargement : the points i made earlier apply here .
in many countries the public still have very little confidence in the new currency .
a second risk concerns interest .
these reforms will be needed even without the euro .
but that is not all .
this work has to continue .
it is important that we make democratic control in the commission as strong as possible .
internal management action is also needed .
in this debate the focus is on the council and commission representatives .
it will be better for everyone to share the responsibility .
who is responsible ?
one of these , already mentioned , is the single currency .
i will speak of enlargement , which is a matter , as you rightly said , mr president of the council , for the whole future of europe .
we still do not have enough of a political objective .
we lack a political strategy .
this is the financial question .
what future , mr president ?
where will the new jobs come from ?
europe must be political or it will not exist !
i think that is a good start !
i think the commission should give us this .
( applause )
the only thing that makes change possible .
europe needs social democracy .
europe needs that , mr president , and i really need more time to speak .
what is the commission 's view of the treaty ?
and if so , what conclusions does it draw from that ?
first , there is the issue of enlargement .
the second issue is the issue of unemployment .
the president of the commission is speaking .
thank you , mr president of the commission .
i think we should all be very pleased .
that is what i said this morning .
this house is not the place to have a debate on this matter .
i shall speak on amendment no 1 .
i know , mr president , that you have come under considerable pressure not to put this amendment to the vote , but you are president of the parliament .
it is for this reason that i request you to put this amendment to the vote .
mr president , on a point of order .
( parliament adopted the proposal )
( applause )
ladies and gentlemen , this is a really important report .
i am therefore taking the opportunity to say that we cannot work in this way .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that has never happened .
i shall not , however , debate the matter any further with you now .
in this i am not alone .
we voted for the report and also for the result of the negotiations .
it remains to be seen how far the agreement will help reduce unemployment .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for doing a good job on the report on an issue which is important for europe .
i welcome the production of this report .
the present community action , a form of draft law , is a step in that direction .
how long should it take ?
what is the problem then ?
this is the first time that the european commission has made use of its right of initiative in a community action .
and i also want to say to her , keep up the good work .
however , solidarity requires that measures are in the context of a set of rules which can be accepted by the citizens of the union .
we must help each other .
one of the main points concerns article 10 of the joint action .
i completely support his position on it .
finally , i want to congratulate the commissioner .
i congratulate her on it .
that is about all .
indeed the provisions for such people already exist in my own country and are implemented .
however , the british labour members have some difficulties with the commission 's proposals as they stand .
for that reason i agree the proposals before us .
that is a proposal that cannot be agreed by us in this form .
then we can take a step in the right direction .
in that way a very large number of people have been able to find the protection they need .
the idea is that decisions can be made from case to case .
that is my specific question .
you can then always debate whether this proposal is strong enough or not , but , as i have said , it is in the proposal .
the debate is closed .
i think the reply is no , mr president .
i shall go through them again .
the position of the committee on development and cooperation is clear .
i have two comments to make on this .
may i ask for a specific answer on that point from the commission at the end of the debate ?
because what is the crucial question when it comes down to it ?
i believe them .
an excellent principle !
we , like many other people , want better information for the consumer .
we accept the two regulations , but on the basis of clear consumer information .
might we ask that a significant step is taken by the other side as well ?
mr president , the position of the group of the european people 's party has been clear from the start and we stand by it .
but that does not mean that we do not want to give the consumer any information .
just one final point .
i would like to make two further comments .
in short , it is a question of respect for our agreements with third countries , respect for the consumer , and respect for the european union 's own legislation .
let us hope that the amendments tabled go forward and we can vote in favour of this proposal .
but in my opinion the rapporteur should see at the end what the result is and if the result is good he should simply refer it back to the commission .
and i note that fact .
you may not do so now .
so something certainly has to be done .
but if that is the way the vote on the amendments goes , then we cannot support the resolution .
if you only want the one and not the other , you would not go with us .
i should like to call on all colleagues to agree with this initiative .
i shall not come back again over the problem as a whole .
i hope we can , but i doubt it .
that has to be the position of the european parliament !
we are concerned today with competition and money !
that was one of many reasons my party voted no .
the common market is not working .
what are we dealing with here ?
and about time !
i would like to mention several points which might not have been brought up yet .
i would like a clear answer on this point .
a lot has been said about the consequences this proposal could have for developing countries .
developing countries can therefore expect their market opportunities to remain .
we have also received positive information on this point .
i hope so .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
it is out of order that our time was taken up by the programme .
thank you for your kind words to us all .
despite the fact that there has been a change of government , there seems to be no change in policy .
i would say simply this .
i can give you no other answer .
thank you , mr president .
i do not think this is a final date .
subject : treaty of amsterdam
there have also been discussions at the parliamentary level about the treaty of amsterdam .
we are sure to return to this debate .
subject : agenda 2000
thank you very much for your answer . it was a very positive answer .
i was not aware of this working group and am very pleased that it has been set up .
i am not so sure of that .
in fact , i am going to try and reply .
why do i say this ?
thank you nevertheless for having given me the floor .
therefore i feel that there are financial interests raised by this matter .
i ask the president-in-office to look at this again .
but i do not make any commitment in this respect as president , simply as minister for cooperation .
mr president , i should just like to say something on the rules of procedure .
you are already aware of the matter .
in this context i should like to come now to four points .
on behalf once more of my group i ask for your agreement to this amendment
this is important and should be supported .
why are they included in the scope ?
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .
no !
i am pleased that we stress balance in paragraph 15 , that is , that there should be a balance between the various interests which are at work in this area .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .
the committee on the environment has proposed several amendments .
i will come back to this later .
but that is not it , the overall reasons say .
we never received a clear answer to that in the committee on environment and i should like to get one now .
there are three points i want to make .
if not , we want some very good reasons why they are not .
i believe we should give serious consideration to the fact that this is also a matter of the future in these countries .
i am nevertheless going to try to reply to your questions .
for the moment i cannot therefore accept these amendments .
that is my question to the commission .
that 's not the problem at all .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .
we want it .
we remain under this today .
we do understand the budgetary situation .
it is the best possible investment in a good future for the whole of europe !
it is important that our children are our future .
i think that we in europe have done a lot for training .
i believe it is necessary to do a lot more in this direction in future .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .
madam president , i have a question .
that being so , it is an important question .
are there any comments ?
in fact , the president decided to refer it to the committee on the rules of procedure .
it was the committee on the rules of procedure which was mentioned .
madam president , i request your help .
perhaps you could give them some reports to do , some real work .
madam president , this is about tomorrow 's minutes .
are there any other comments on the minutes ?
( the minutes were approved )
madam president , on a point of order .
'
madam president , on a point of order .
it is quite unacceptable .
i think you understand me .
i hope that will happen .
madam president , the members of the committee on agriculture and rural development have tabled this again .
it concerns an increase of ecu 1 million .
it is not appropriate to discuss the content of the amendment at this point .
thank you very much .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
when all is said and done it is only in budgetary matters that the european parliament has any real power .
that is something at least .
but the main thing is to support the interests of the third world , and that is what we did .
i hope that it will have that good sense .
my final vote will therefore be in favour .
i think that is unacceptable .
last but not least , the cultural aspects must be taken into consideration .
but research after the fact is not what is needed .
there is absolutely no reason for the eu to concern itself with this question .
i hope that you and your group do not carry this responsibility , mr president .
what consumers want is clear .
but there are a number of proposed amendments to the report which give cause for concern .
in the light of this experience , we can understand why it is so important that we work together on this area .
if they are allowed into the eu , they should also be able to get education and jobs .
however , i do find it difficult to see why this is being discussed in the european parliament .
i thank him for being there .
this is an issue on which joint action by the union is appropriate .
we must act .
why continue the dialogue ?
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
some would say : ' so what ?
that is not acceptable to us .
for that reason we must make a clear statement from this parliament that we make both our short term and our long term aid subject to certain conditions .
that should be the central concern of the european parliament .
so i would just like to say a few words about the amendments .
there is no doubt about it .
i agree with the resolution where it says : ' monitoring is a problem ' .
that is not what we are about here .
we must continue with the dialogue .
they want help with new technology .
the result of these urgent actions is positive .
additional aid measures may have to be adopted in the coming months .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we need to have a common approach , a common opinion .
today we have a resolution which in my view makes a common opinion possible .
we know what that means .
kosovo
that will not be a problem for the european union .
i doubt it .
no , no , no !
mr president , a state of law must guarantee the security of its citizens .
we did not vote yesterday as a united group .
this is an unacceptable situation .
why this initiative ?
the third problem is that of kosovo .
the debate is closed .
i would like the european commission to take this initiative .
then europe would mean something in the world .
the commission should help us in this .
the resolution does not offer them a single solution .
everything possible must be done , therefore , even by the european union .
the debate is closed .
but help will soon be on the way .
and that is true .
these are questions which we must ask ourselves and which the commission must also ask itself .
i welcome the resolution and hope to see some action from the commission .
the commission will support this initiative .
food aid is also included .
mr president , this is not a point of order .
i would just like to express my thanks to the commissioner .
mr president , as i mentioned a short while ago during the debate in the house , our group would like to propose an addition to paragraph 4 of the joint resolution .
we had proposed an amendment , but i would like to point out that it is an addition to paragraph 4 .
it is not before time .
i thank all members for their attention .
i will not use up all the time available . i think i have said what i wanted to say .
there are two other points i wish to comment on .
this is important .
this is an area where there is a clear need for european rules as well as national rules .
this has to be a good thing .
in conclusion , mr president , i would like to say the following .
mr president , there is another issue .
i should like to begin with that .
the european commission cannot get away with just a note on the subject .
it is an issue which requires special attention .
this is a difficult debate , and you can be certain that the commission will continue to follow future developments in this sector with interest .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
what are we saying here ?
i do not think so .
there is something new .
on what criteria is it to be carried out ?
it does little good for us to discuss it here in the european parliament or in the european commission .
what is needed is a global solution through the un or the wto - i do not know which is most appropriate .
it is important that this is included .
i think that is a task for the national governments rather than the european commission .
secondly the government also has a responsibility .
do we really know the answer to that question ?
the essential point is whether or not we want to do something about it .
but we have a problem here .
work with them .
we must start there .
it is also essential to promote legal , responsible use of the information and communication services .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
we are still on the minutes .
( the minutes were approved )
that is the information i wish to give you .
we should not be taking any action against them .
ladies and gentlemen , something has already been said about that .
the matter will be discussed again .
we can only discuss the issue if it is part of the agenda !
the minutes have already been approved .
for this we must do more to call upon the european court of justice , the european institutions , for action .
this is not a question for the eu .
the eu is not and is not going to become a state .
at the same time it is the guarantee of freedom of speech .
the member states are best able to do this themselves .
i think this is a step in the right direction , but , as i said , i think we should continue working on this matter .
unfortunately , other member states have not yet fully implemented the european legislation .
control - the real point of this problem is the control system .
we must keep out of this .
that is the problem .
my group will vote in favour of this report .
we should take note of this fact also in today 's general debate .
i am here .
that is where we are now .
that is the problem .
madam president , on a point of order .
naturally i have an interest .
this is obviously a difficult problem .
that should be our aim in the long term .
in recent years there has been some move in this direction .
what is going on is unacceptable .
we cannot support this any longer .
however , this has not happened by any means .
amendments nos 3 , 4 and 5 concern the application of community regulations in third countries .
as for the other amendments , the commission does not consider it practical to include these proposals in the text of the regulation itself .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
although we can see that from here , i will call them if you wish .
it is wrong to use public funds in this way .
i welcome this development .
we hope that will happen .
i do not think so .
we want the market to decide the rules .
i do feel , however , that we must discuss this again , and that we must approach this market issue in a fundamental way .
is that what it all comes down to ?
certainly not .
the commission has based its proposal on objective and relevant criteria .
let me say the following about the amendments .
let me say something about just three points in this discussion .
i should like to point out , therefore , that this one measure cannot offer a solution for the whole problem .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
madam president , i have a problem .
i would like to vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that is why i cannot support the report .
no , mr president !
are there any comments ?
of course that is not true .
( parliament approved the minutes )
we cannot vote on this tomorrow .
the opinion of the committee on the environment is not there . the opinion of the committee on legal affairs is not there .
for these reasons we feel that there is absolutely every reason to refer this report back to the committee .
ladies and gentlemen , we cannot get into a debate on this issue .
the position is very clear then .
in any case , as you know , we have already voted for the agenda .
( parliament decided to keep the report on the agenda )
urgent political matters
the next item is a commission communication on urgent political matters of major importance .
i therefore consider it adopted and that is what we will do .
i can say to start with that conclusions were not reached on every issue regarding enlargement .
if so , how is this to be achieved ?
the same goes for the east .
you are entirely right .
it seems to me that it does not .
that is most certainly not a matter for comment by the commission .
that is not his job .
this is quite unacceptable and the commissioner has said as much .
if there is a demand for change in the law then certainly people can make that demand .
but nothing has happened .
there were a great many .
i believe we need to do a number of things .
i consider this essential !
( applause )
and it should not be any other way .
therefore measures must be taken in all european countries and in countries where it does not yet happen .
a call that we most certainly wish to support .
and that is true .
the decision to be taken is no small matter .
that is the main problem .
in other words , can we , as it were , not go a step further and request further powers for the european parliament .
the answer to these three questions must be no , no and no .
understand that if you can !
finally , i wish to congratulate the rapporteur .
i hope we will finally be up to the task .
that is a fact .
but today there is nothing .
i would also ask those responsible for this excellent report : what are we actually dealing with today ?
what is there to be done ?
let us hope that we do not need any more victims !
there is a question of what should we do , and what we can do , at a european level .
four things .
i shall make that clear before the vote tomorrow .
the debate is closed .
common fisheries policy after 2002
that is why this report is particularly important .
it is not of course the last word of the european parliament on this subject .
the social aspects of this must of course be taken into consideration at the same time .
but i would like to put the debate a little in context .
what is involved ?
what does that tell us ?
first of all that we cannot , under any circumstances , carry on as we are now .
that means that a fundamental reform of fisheries policy is essential .
first of all , it is to have clear objectives - i do not believe we have those at the moment .
it was unacceptable .
why ?
all of us know that fisheries is not the same as any other business .
management is the key to the future .
where will these people find work ?
i should like to address three specific points .
first , the question of international fisheries agreements .
mr president , i would also like to congratulate the rapporteur .
we have a compromise here and in any compromise we do not all get what we want .
finally , i am very pleased about what the rapporteur says about international fishing agreements .
the first concerns the application of the single market rules .
i support her call that agriculture be made a major priority of the common fisheries policy .
i have to say we must continue to make this point .
the debate is closed .
the same applies to the procedures .
indeed the draft amsterdam treaty takes the same approach .
my group will therefore vote against that amendment .
our group is going to support the committee 's proposal as we did at the first reading .
i feel that this proposal is a step on the way to a rather better position for women .
that is the really the reason why i would ask the commissioner to pay special attention to a few amendments .
i am in full agreement with that text .
i should like to ask your opinion on it .
so it made its decision almost two months before time .
then of the 11 amendments which the commission approved , it only accepted two .
the european parliament has shown the way in this respect .
as regards the scope of the directive , the commission has also expressed its difficulties with the approach taken in the common position .
it is not accepted because of the need to focus on the key issues today .
the debate is closed .
what does this mean ?
i certainly could not tell you !
we all know that the candidate countries have a long way to go .
so there is some pressure involved .
the debate is closed .
all that is needed is the political will .
that is something that must always be taken into account .
that is a key question .
i do not believe that that is the reason , therefore .
in view of this we would also ask for support for our amendments .
tomorrow we shall of course vote for agreement on this report .
very little .
the debate is closed .
the second point is important .
the question has often come up in committee to what extent our work is relevant at all .
have the nations not already decided for themselves what they want to do ?
what is our role here as a parliament ?
so i would , again , ask the commission to look at this question .
so this is of vital importance .
and we support that .
i believe this has real value .
six would be enough .
they will come , but i think there are still several problems .
let me just end with another point .
i am sure of that .
parliament must take important decisions .
the third decision is the national face of the euro .
that is not all .
and for what reason ?
this is not the right way .
naturally that was a very important call on his time .
first , the question of the national face .
the other member states concerned are about to do so .
therefore , the commission is prepared to take up four amendments in its proposal .
in both cases i find it unacceptable .
but it is a debate we must have in due course .
the debate is closed .
the matter which we now have to decide on is another example of this .
this is important .
there has never been any common legislation in the past .
that is , of course , a good thing .
we welcome it for that reason as well .
however , i should like to focus the commission 's mind on another issue .
the question of control of member states by the commission is after all something we should all support .
as far as possible the rules should be international , global .
however , i have a point to make in connection with that .
this directive should be seen as a part of that work .
amendment no 4 should also be supported .
the debate is closed .
in conclusion , mr president , as i have already said , and because this is only a first step , the directive must be adopted as soon as possible .
the debate is closed .
but this will not happen without the political will , which member states have so far not shown .
but the commission has had the support of civil society .
i would like to make my main point three times .
there is not enough money .
there is not enough money .
there is not enough money .
the third point concerns the process of european union enlargement .
mr president , i would now like to make specific mention of the amendments that have been tabled .
the same is true for amendment no 3 .
for this reason , we cannot accept this amendment .
unfortunately we have not heard anything about these and they are very important to us .
if you do not have them available at the moment , can you perhaps tell us about these tomorrow morning .
agreed , we can get the reply to you in another way .
the debate is closed .
we must therefore support these changes , which improve an existing agreement .
with regard to the procedure , there is a matter to which i wish to draw attention .
thank you , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we shall get back to you later .
social protection
all member states are now agreed on this and i think it is high time some action was taken .
take it from me : we do not think that is enough !
that is employment .
the other systems try to include everyone .
not to give the individual less power , but to give him more power .
i am not so sure she is right .
i mentioned the change in conditions .
but i have a few comments to make .
this is the key response here this morning .
that in itself is a considerable step forward .
i thank the rapporteur and her colleagues for their support in this regard .
the debate is closed .
i should like to end by making two comments on international cooperation . the world is no longer what it was .
there is a need to adopt a new approach .
i congratulate the commission on its report .
the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights has raised some issues in its opinion .
therefore it is also important that these parties have rights .
in the short time available to me , madam president , i should like to make just three points .
furthermore , we must consider employment .
i would like to start with a few general comments on the commission 's implementation of competition policy .
competition policy is of central importance in the single market .
but in many areas we agree with the rapporteur and the commission .
information must be made public .
the member states of the european union still give too much state aid to companies .
the increasing integration of the world market requires a sector by sector approach .
this is something fundamental for the future of our economy and our industry .
first on the subject of the changes in the amsterdam treaty .
that is a real problem .
that is not true .
what is the commission doing about this ?
well , it is taking action and it is already dealing with a number of cases .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
so i would like to make it clear that we can vote the same way .
that is not in the text now .
the second reason is more fundamental however .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
ladies and gentlemen , it does not make sense .
mr president , certainly not .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , i would like to ask for parliament 's support for a small technical amendment to point 12 .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i hope my colleagues will support this .
so i think this report , which is presented on behalf of the committee on external economic relations , should be put to the vote of parliament today .
i agree with the amendment from the group of the european people 's party , which means having the report every two years .
on amendment no 12
on paragraph 15
i would like to request that this should be put to the vote again . you have not done that !
i agree with that proposal , mr president .
there is nothing more to vote on .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we would like to thank the rapporteur for the report .
that is what i say .
this would conflict with the basic principles of the free democratic order .
it is simply essential .
one of the main problems in europe today , however , is that we are using far too much energy .
we would like to thank the rapporteur for his report .
what has happened to that project ?
that is enough .
we do not have any authority in this area as a parliament .
the european parliament can and must make its contribution .
but i want to make three points .
instead i think it should be the member states that carry on the fight against this type of crime .
i just wanted to point out that it might have been a good thing to draw attention to this again in the report .
the common fisheries policy is due for review in 2002 .
so my group has not been able to support it .
social policy is a national matter .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , on a point of order .
if you want to give me more information that would be good .
we will , however , try to receive him here at the most appropriate moment possible .
thank you for saying that you will look into this issue .
mr president , i wish to comment on the agenda for today and tomorrow .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the following amendments have been proposed :
this has happened again today with this important report on the review of energy policy measures .
( parliament approved the proposal )
perhaps we could now put this report in .
the commission will issue its own communication on the future of the social fund at the turn of the year .
( parliament approved the proposal )
( the order of business was thus established )
the next item is the joint debate on :
and where are those ?
at that time the european union will also have to decide on future measures to be taken in order to achieve these objectives .
first , a little about the eu 's position .
the commission has raised the question with the member states .
these points have already been discussed .
i think that is the right idea .
in addition , investment in developing countries can play a crucial role in this .
how is that to be achieved in the time ?
it is , quite simply , nuclear energy .
this is quite possible .
let us think about the developing world and the energy needs there .
we must promote them .
that is what we actually have .
that is why this debate is so important .
it was clear to me that they would be prepared to go further .
we should instead say that this is only the first step .
if so , what are these means ?
it is what is practical today , though , and for that reason we must support the commission on this point .
that has already been said .
we can give many good reasons for that .
the commissioner should do more in this respect .
no agreement can avoid it .
one of these , obviously , is nuclear energy .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , may i first of all congratulate parliament on this debate .
above all i want to congratulate you on your support for the council and the commission .
allow me to make a number of comments on the points raised during this debate .
i am not even sure myself , it is for the council to decide .
we will have an opportunity of discussing how we can do that later , and how we will achieve the results in the european union .
the debate is closed .
that is more than enough .
the debate is closed .
of course it is also important to demand a certain quality level within all european member states .
i am pleased that the committee on culture has accepted these .
to promote such quality education has now become the job of the community .
the debate is closed .
what is it about and which report was i responsible for ?
i hope you agree to the resolution and that the house will vote for it tomorrow .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , this is a comment on the minutes , too .
no essential reason provided for in the rules is given for this .
the house was fully aware of the issue at the time of the vote .
( the minutes were approved )
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
so in our opinion this is an important area .
that cannot be right !
nevertheless , there is certainly a good deal to be said for these programmes .
the time for which i was allowed to speak to you is over .
let me thank you for your good cooperation .
i thank you for your attention .
( applause )
the commission therefore will come back to this question in the context of agenda 2000 .
mr president , i have four questions .
can you give us some idea of that ?
what is your response to that ?
however , there are some points that obviously cause us great concern , particularly in the field of cooperation with the member states .
we would be very pleased !
but i would like to ask your opinion on a subject which particularly concerns me , as i am the rapporteur for the budget .
that is my general question .
i also have a more specific question to put to you .
i should like to put three specific questions .
the third question , mr president , concerns the national monitoring institutions .
my last question concerns the commission .
mr president , i should like to ask two questions .
i just want to ask three questions .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank you for the interest you bring to the report .
i know the difficulties between the member states and the commission .
the expenditure programmes of the community are put into effect by the member states .
you are quite right !
thank you for your attention .
( applause )
thank you very much , mr president !
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
you will find the results in the report .
i believe we have made good proposals to you .
( applause )
effort !
applause
it is now their role to take up this work .
we should be making that case here .
then the commission will move .
mr president , we find today that it was right to set up a monitoring committee .
in the first place , we want to support fully the rapporteur 's proposals in his conclusion regarding the need to ensure transparency within the commission .
i have no reason to doubt that the case will be the same for the proposals that the commission will present following your conclusions of today .
it is for you to measure the progress achieved .
some measures have already been taken .
mr president , we are today at the end of a first stage .
i now come to another question .
the commission , as you know , did not do this .
mr president , together we have come a long way .
a great deal has already been achieved .
mr president , mr president of the commission , thank you !
just tell me .
can you tell us ?
this will mean that we will be able to look into the situation regarding the quality of our food .
we think that is extremely important .
agreement on these issues needs to be reached in an international framework .
one last point .
we must now look to the future .
as i say , we must now move on .
i look forward to that .
i wish you well in the future .
mr president , i would like to say a few words on how i feel at this stage in the debate .
it must be clear to us , between ourselves .
we are at an important stage , not the final point .
but unfortunately that is not how things are .
in any case , we can always hope .
now let me go into some points of the report .
we must have a serious debate about both questions .
i agree with you entirely .
thank you !
a number of people have referred to this .
we in this committee have achieved something .
the relevant legislation will in future take place with the responsible cooperation of parliament .
we have not achieved everything .
in this regard i have to say that the work of the special committee and the views of parliament were also significant .
there we will not let go !
we have established a commission political responsibility .
i want to concern myself with what the president-in-office said here .
the european commission will never be able to take the place of national control systems .
that is not a point of order .
i must therefore ask you to stop .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
that is a political fact .
everything must be done to respect public health and to protect our consumers .
how can we make sure that the member states follow up european concerns on an international level ?
we shall see how it goes .
i was a member of both .
so what more have we to do ?
you can and should do it .
so do it !
but i am going to say the same thing again : do it now !
we have not made much progress on this point .
there is no question about that .
that is my problem .
that is the point .
we cannot make a general statement .
the other matter , the other policy at issue is the common agricultural policy .
i think that is good and i also welcome the measures the commission has taken .
for me this is just the beginning of a process which can only go forward .
mr president , i congratulate you .
you have made a good move .
this is the only thing on which i congratulate you .
quite clearly so .
for what ?
for health ?
this is all i wanted to say .
i have put them into groups .
firstly , relations with member states .
it is clear that there is a problem in this area .
there is therefore clearly a problem in this area .
it is something that will take at least ten years .
in this regard i would like to say two things .
i can provide you with the report in question , but it is already available to your colleagues .
the debate is closed .
so what is the problem ?
that must not be allowed to happen .
thank you all once again .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
but this is not the case !
it does not prevent a single member state from making better regulations .
here there is more to be done .
but above all we must do more in relation to investment .
investment is the key .
matters relating to employment and working conditions in the fisheries sector are perhaps the least developed aspects of community fisheries policy at the moment .
i believe that this first step should be a very clear one .
i would think that that will give people much more hope .
there is little i can add to that .
we know that .
but it is the first contribution to this debate , and that is more than we have had so far .
and the matter does not end there .
what we have before us is the result of labour market negotiations .
there are not many days left to go .
i am not so sure that it will , but let us still hope .
many people believe that growth is the only thing that can help us out of unemployment .
very good .
that is not how things work .
however , measures must be taken at the national level .
because this is particularly important in this case .
we need to ensure that all our workers have equal protection in the social field and in terms of employment , pay and conditions .
) mr president , it is clear that there is no single answer to the difficult problem of unemployment .
for this reason we must :
we also have a summit on employment which shall take place this week .
i would like to comment on a few things .
seen in the long term that can only be good .
that is not true .
question time ( commission )
i have two questions .
it will then be possible to draw the necessary conclusions for the eu .
subject : environmental assessment
i would like to say thank you for your reply .
no , the commission has not had an opportunity to look into this matter .
could she address my specific points ?
will you reform human resources training ?
you are absolutely right : that is the line we are taking .
however , that will take time .
therefore , i do not think the commission should express any opinion on this matter .
thank you for your comments , mr president .
absolutely not !
that is all i can say to you .
i do not accept that at all .
of course i am aware of them .
it does not take a political position .
obviously , we would not get involved in this political question in favour of either side .
but i would like to ask you to take account of what i have said .
i think that must be enough !
so we have done everything necessary at the right time .
so we have again and again made people aware of this year 2000 problem .
thank you for that reply .
mr president , i can really only answer the first part of the question with hope .
there are two problems .
then there is a third group , to which you refer in your second question .
we can then decide whether we need to make our own decision .
that is the short form of a long answer , mr president .
i still do not really think that i have had an answer to the questions i put .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
i think that in future this must never happen again .
i welcome that answer .
subject : agenda 2000
these criteria should take account of the regional priorities of the member states .
i thank the commissioner for her answer .
who will make the decision on the criteria ?
will it be a joint decision ?
will it be a commission decision ? will the member states make the decision ?
secondly , what level will it be based on ?
third question : when ?
we are currently working out the criteria .
i can therefore not give a final answer .
it was when it was brought into effect .
we all agree on the importance of the overall economic situation .
that is what is different .
everything is in place for this to be a success .
we all know that .
this agreement is to be seen , therefore , as a very important first step forward .
the joint debate is closed .
there is therefore still much to be done by the commission , by the council and by this parliament , before these vital regulations can become a reality .
mr president , mr commissioner , there is so much talk about what the union should look at .
but here we really do have a field which the union should be seriously involved in .
so we need to go on working on this directive .
these are a very welcome first step and i hope they will lead to even greater safety throughout the european union .
finally , there is one amendment that the commission cannot support .
we consider that article 12 is a necessary instrument to guarantee the proper application of a community legal instrument in the member states and we therefore want to keep it in the text .
the debate is closed .
economic and social cohesion
so , we agree that the structural policies have to change many things .
we cannot take away from the regions with one hand what we have given them with the other .
but there can be no doubt about our commitment to cohesion .
in fact , we have it in every treaty , including the treaty of amsterdam .
it is not .
are we to allow this to continue ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the european union is more than a common internal market .
i will talk about this later .
the debate on the structural fund will take place next year .
he has done great service to the subject matter , namely economic and social cohesion , and i would like to congratulate him on his report .
what does economic and social cohesion mean ?
it is a policy which cannot be implemented .
we also have to ask how much this will cost .
of course we will have to think about this again in five years time and review the situation .
i believe that the same applies to the cohesion fund , which was set up to help member states move towards monetary union .
but cohesion must also come from within .
the committee on agriculture and rural development has also referred to this in its opinion statement .
i cannot support the call for an additional structural policy support instrument in respect of economic and monetary union .
and that is something which we all want to prevent .
thank you , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is the purpose of our amendments nos 1 , 3 and 5 .
we hope to increase it further .
madam president , i would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
the rapporteur has called for increased transparency .
there is little doubt about that .
we need to see real transparency .
that is very important .
monitoring is very important .
finally , the funding must be additional .
that has happened in this case .
i am sure the commissioner will do the same .
the debate is closed .
and this is what has happened today .
i congratulate them and i am very pleased .
nevertheless , we have presented some amendments to our rapporteur 's compromise , for which we congratulate her .
this is no small step , madam president .
tomorrow it is the turn of the member states .
i should mention here the commission 's commitment to your request .
thank you , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
in most cases this means women .
let us do better in the future .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , women are not being asked , but they are the answer .
we must therefore give all due attention to this report and this council regulation and wish them every success .
allow me finally to say something about the general scope of this debate .
as far as the implementation is concerned , not much has been done so far .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that was my first question .
the second question .
now they must be implemented .
this is extremely serious .
people say either too much , or not enough .
i do not think we can get into a debate on this point .
i really wanted to say that .
why do i ask for this statement ?
that is why we would like you to ask the european commission to make a statement tomorrow during the period which is available for urgent matters .
madam president , on a point of order .
i do not believe the council will be present tomorrow .
ladies and gentlemen , a proposal has been made , from two political groups .
you know the rules better than i do .
you have taken up the proposal on your own initiative , because you know the rules .
indeed , only the president can make a proposal during the sitting itself .
i shall put my proposal to the vote .
( parliament approved the president 's proposal )
before subject i
this is not a point of debate , this is a point of order , madam president .
treaty of amsterdam
i believe that any assessment of the amsterdam treaty must be made from two points of view .
that was a good thing , in my view .
at the same time , however , it is a community based on values .
it is not simply a common market : it is a community based on values .
that is true .
but there is the possibility of increasing those funds .
all this is positive , but , in the field of foreign policy , the most important thing is political will .
there will be no common foreign policy until the member states ' governments feel the need for one .
there is a need to create that political will .
the treaty of amsterdam is a road .
it must form part of the political process .
in terms of the common foreign and security policy , this treaty does not give us as much as we would want , and certainly not as much as europe needs .
i hope that this can be implemented in practice .
instead of an economic and monetary union we will now get a social and monetary union .
parliament , together with other institutions , will have to do a great deal to get his going .
on behalf of the committee on development , i would like to make the following comments .
all of them !
what is not allowed to be , does not happen !
one final point : international agreements are a most important part of the common fishing policy .
the next intergovernmental conference will not be far away , and our demands for a policy on fishing will not be far away either !
this is a long and significant list .
it is not so much that we need new powers within the european union .
i believe this is something we should be working on .
this is a major development !
we are called upon as the european parliament to make use of these instruments too .
with foreign and security policy we have new areas and new procedures .
practice will show whether these really bring progress .
only then will we be in the position to bring about a new order for europe , and this is something we should be working towards .
however , i would like another type of debate .
it is a proposal for the future .
i shall not speak about content .
but there is also a question of strategy .
madam president , there are many things in the treaty of amsterdam .
the need for such a common approach is clear , today more than ever before .
there is no other solution .
firstly , we shall have to create the institutional conditions necessary for enlargement .
almost everyone has said that .
what we must not do is what we did last time .
in my view , this is very important .
that will not take us forward in europe !
not at all !
europe , that means its citizens .
the european employment summit needs practical success .
here you have nothing to say .
i do not think so .
the first is protection .
finally , proposal . this is where this report makes its major contribution , i believe .
this is the essential contribution of this report .
i will support that call , as will the majority of my group .
they did not do so .
so what should we do ?
that might not be much , but we should not make it anything less !
who should decide in each individual case ?
from our point of view there must always be a balance between stability and reform .
in our view this is a time for stability .
a small step forward has also been made regards the transparency of institutions , because the council minutes will be made public in the future .
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is the common text which was discussed by everyone .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it may be that council and parliament , as institutions , have reached a high level of agreement .
on the other hand , there is reason to congratulate ourselves on there being a common position , which was precisely the wish of our parliament in the first reading .
of course we can have our say in these policy areas in future .
the text on which we are today to give our opinion is part of this set of measures .
and not a lot has happened on that point .
women should be included in all aspects of development cooperation and in all eu policies which have to do with developing countries .
unfortunately that is not all that these days .
but they are by no means sufficient .
this is expressed in the amendments .
i would like to congratulate him .
this is a major problem both for today and over the next few years .
not all are pleased about this , and some may even be of the opinion that we do far too much in this field .
the eu 's position is in the right direction , but in my opinion it does not go far enough .
i do not agree with that .
tax policy should not be made an eu concern .
this is progress in the right direction , even though there is still a long way to go .
given this situation , what are the european commission and the member states doing ?
this proposal is quite foreign to our debate .
we must not therefore let up the pressure .
as far as i am concerned , this is one of the conditions of such growth .
no more funding for the information society , no more funding for research .
the report is very full .
we would like to thank the rapporteur for a good job on the report .
in a word , this is good work .
i hope that this aspect will be supported by the european parliament and by the commission .
we want nothing to do with it .
on a point of order .
that would be a crucial change which would change the nature of the union in the direction of a state .
mr president , this assessment is more general .
the crucial question now is what the next step is going to be .
everyone says so , and they are right .
what institutional reform , at the end of the day ?
that is what the whole purpose of the european cooperation was .
it is far more important than the question of to what extent the treaty could have been better on certain points .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i thank the rapporteur for this excellent report .
i would ask support for the motion for the amendment which was approved in the report .
what was not done in amsterdam should be done as soon as possible .
there is time to do it . it must be done .
but in time for what ?
until the single currency comes in we have time to think about real institutional reform .
perhaps not .
now let us move on to the future .
let us ask others also to think about the future .
it is not a matter of what others shall do later , but of what we shall do now .
firstly , much has been said here about citizens .
this is the real problem .
the european political project is one of enlargement .
we have already seen quite clearly that the current procedures for discussion among governments did not give good results .
let us allow the citizens to speak out more clearly , and let us give more power to the european parliament .
we are always discussing the reforms of the commission , the number of members in this parliament , but we never discuss the council .
however , i would like to say that we have some difficulties with the report on the amsterdam treaty on some points .
we will have to vote against some of the points .
i am going to put myself in the position of the european public .
the debate is closed .
these are the essential matters , i believe , for debate at the summit .
we are developing our foreign policy cooperation .
we can and will do more .
these issues are of great concern to me , to the european union 's member states and , of course , to parliament .
however , it is important to stress why this summit in particular has its importance .
i would like to ask three questions of the council and the commission in terms of this summit meeting .
all this requires a true foreign and common security policy .
has the strategy of the commission been the right one ?
i believe that over the last few years a lot has been achieved by the work of the commission in particular .
it is our responsibility , not the responsibility of the commission or the council .
perhaps that is one of the problems .
it will not do that we have a political and economic agenda , but not a parliamentary one .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would also like to say a word about our policy as part of the wto .
that is my hope .
we are open to discussions on this subject .
that already is an important point .
indeed , i believe that there is a role not only for the commission , and for the council , but also for the parliament .
mr president , i have no time to say more .
i will add just one thing .
that i very much agree with .
that is an important part of the agenda .
the debate is closed .
( applause from the green group )
mr president , i too voted against this resolution .
the reason was that i do not believe that the intergovernmental conference is any longer the right way to further the development of the european union .
there are also many other things we welcome .
it is a success for political cooperation in the area of the environment , equal opportunity and , above all , employment .
it is unacceptable .
we have voted no to the report .
the principle of democracy must be applied to the european union as it is in all member states .
there are four such criteria .
let me review them .
now , what does the amsterdam treaty propose ?
i voted against the resolution on the treaty of amsterdam , as i agree with it to a large extent .
it did not work .
that is not what i wanted to come out of the intergovernmental conference .
this democratic aspect is the whole reason why i am taking a stand against this report .
the european union should be a cooperation between independent states .
that is why i am voting against this report .
question time ( council )
we must try to do so .
i think this is a clear position .
as regards the first part of the question , i have no further information .
if there is a problem in community law , the court of justice should be able , in my opinion , to deal with the matter .
the council has never discussed the problem raised by the honourable member in her question .
and that is the context of my reply .
this is a very good question .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
we cannot do that today .
is that it ?
that is why we expect a little more commitment .
i would like to ask what objectives actually exist .
i have no doubt , in this particular case , that the council will do just that .
the honourable member is being too kind to me .
i thank the president-in-office of the council for his reply .
finally , the european union has made a commitment in favour of democracy and the protection of human rights .
thank you for your response .
what more can europe do ?
action plan for the single market
the internal market , ladies and gentlemen , does not exist in all areas yet , and that costs european business , large and small , year after year , a great deal of money .
that is what we have this summit for .
the last point i would like to draw to your attention is the importance of a european market for information services .
but to achieve this the union will have to do a great deal of work ; also in the internal market as well .
in the committee 's opinion , there is a need for action .
of course , a great deal needs to happen at european level .
but i would also like to ask the member states to pay attention to this problem .
mr commissioner , may i mention two sectors .
what is the commissioner 's opinion on this ?
it is clearly not .
i hope the groups will support this motion .
something for everyone .
i think that there is a job for this parliament , to implement the internal market in this area , too .
however , i would like to make the following four comments :
the debate is closed .
we have just been discussing the single market .
now three levels are required , as mentioned in the report .
we must try to make the effort .
i should also like to put my question right away as i believe it is too important to be left to one side .
the debate is closed .
this is an excellent report .
we welcome the commission 's proposals .
it is clear that it has an interest in this .
i would like to hear the commissioner 's opinion on this .
secondly , the information systems will provide the technical means for cooperation .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i can only agree with the rapporteur .
that also applies to people who are at special risk .
the second issue is new technology .
i would like to support his report .
the debate is closed .
we do not always agree , but when we do , i believe it should be mentioned .
mr president , my point concerns the minutes .
( the minutes were approved )
joint action is required .
in addition , i have included in the report some new points of view that were not included , that is , areas that had not been discussed .
in particular , i would like to draw attention to the practical work , since i believe that it is extremely important .
i feel that this has been an extremely good cooperation .
in the long term , this will help us to create an area for legal security within the union .
in order to be able to take effective measures , we must know what it is we are talking about .
it is also important to address questions relating to information technology .
on those points where other views were expressed we have now put forward compromise proposals .
i therefore feel it is right for parliament to be able to put forward its views .
the action plan is a significant change .
this third aspect is not on parliament 's agenda .
that is the basic question !
i think that was very important .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i have been following the debate with a great deal of interest .
a high level group including representatives of the member states and the commission was therefore set up for this purpose .
let me also say something about the points at issue .
we have today in the european union 15 different legal systems .
this is an example of the new problems that we must address .
i share the view that cooperation must be the first consideration .
but increased cooperation alone is not enough .
i completely agree .
it goes without saying that i support this proposal .
this is something that i think it is important for us to develop .
we need both .
i believe that it is important to establish this fact .
i think that is essential .
in connection with this i would like to make the following comments .
that is not enough for action to be taken .
what do i mean by that ?
and they do just that .
they have been doing it for years .
we must not allow this .
we must look at that particular aspect of legislation .
i hope it is of help to you .
i understand from the commissioner , as well as from the minister , that something will actually happen as a result of their contribution .
there are only a few points .
having said that , i would like to add what i believe to be the real priorities .
why is this so ?
i would , however , like to have that included in the minutes .
these questions must be brought into focus .
today we know full well that no individual member state is in a position to ensure internal security using its own means .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i do not ask for more .
i think this should be our aim , this should be our objective .
but the objective is there .
the debate is closed .
cooperation priorities in justice and home affairs
for , as the previous debate has shown , this field is of increasing importance for the whole european union .
it is now up to the council to find an answer to the commission 's proposals .
we ask that of you , mr president of the council .
i am not sure if one can really talk of priorities in this list .
they must keep step with the development of the internal market if we are really to create an area of freedom , security and law , as set out in the amsterdam treaty .
why not , indeed ?
thank you , mr minister , that is what i wanted to hear .
they can already do that .
these do not exist here .
that is an asylum policy which we will not support .
absolutely .
however , there is a serious problem about the decisions which have been taken .
mr president , the council and the commission need to draw up a report on the progress of the implementation of union level decisions into national legislation .
i believe a report of this kind should be discussed in this parliament as well .
mr president , many decisions have been taken .
and this is what this programme actually means .
when the new amsterdam treaty comes into force we shall receive new , increased opportunities for cooperation . this is an important step forward .
this has two important consequences .
but even in these areas , cooperation will be developed through framework decisions , and so on .
thank you , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
so i will put it to parliament .
( parliament adopted the amendments )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i would like to hear the opinion of the rapporteur .
there is a reason for this .
thank you very much .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i therefore give the report my full support .
this is a step in the right direction .
we must act now .
i can agree to several of the proposals in the report .
situation in iraq
the next item is the commission statement on the situation in iraq .
mr commissioner , thank you for your report .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner for his statement .
secondly , the humanitarian aspect .
mr president , mr commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .
the international community , mr president , must act as one .
and if so , what was the result of all these efforts ?
and if not , why not ?
enough is enough .
that is the most important statement he can make today .
in itself this is very significant .
on the subject of humanitarian aid .
the debate is closed .
mr president , mr commissioner , i would first like to say how pleased i am that our resolution today has been supported by six groups in this house .
i think this will be a great step forward and that we as the european parliament should do everything possible to see that it is successful .
for that reason i fully support this motion , as does my group , even though there are obviously several problems .
all the same i have some questions .
how does it work ?
it is extremely important that such a court should exist .
if necessary , we will have to continue without the countries which are not and do not want to become part of it .
the debate is closed .
what is to be done ?
however , it seems to me that two fundamental problems still exist .
it is not that we do not support the text of the resolution .
we do : in fact , we support everything in it .
we will therefore vote against the text which has been proposed .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following resolutions :
protection of children 's rights
so what about the transparency of the european institutions ?
this is completely unacceptable !
the government party could and should do something but so far we have heard nothing .
i am very pleased that the matter has taken this turn .
the debate is closed .
it goes without saying that we support this call , and i believe that a democratic state requires an independent legal system .
madam president , everything has been said .
at any rate , i heard nothing .
i should like very much to have some information on the situation .
the debate is closed .
what can be more important than that ?
and why ?
the debate is closed .
i cannot back this .
this was not the case .
this i cannot accept , and i have therefore voted no to the report .
i am absolutely in agreement with the committee and the rapporteur on this point .
mr president , first of all i would like to make it clear that our group will support this proposal .
at the same time , i would like to address a question to us all .
then there is the cooperation with the candidate member states .
this is something we can fully support .
what is the commission 's position on this ?
the european union is a citizens ' rights union .
and so it should be .
the amsterdam treaty provided for this over a five year period .
the same applies to immigration policy .
you may ask what asylum and immigration have to do with one another .
their reply was that they had nothing to do with europe .
but that is not true .
i am , for that matter , prepared to bring up this issue in the council of ministers .
the debate is closed .
that is very important .
we are also concerned with technical points .
the social fund is investment in people .
so it really is a people 's fund - it is human resources .
obviously , this is another area which the commission must address .
be that as it may , a fundamental reform of the structural funds is needed .
in any case not in this case .
so i believe that the fund should be used for what it is set up for .
the group of the european people 's party voted against this report in committee .
that will make the commission 's work more difficult in future .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
it is about the minutes from the day before yesterday .
( the minutes were approved )
madam president , i should like to make a short statement concerning my report .
but we have to go along with it .
it has happened .
that 's excellent !
however , i am , of course , in favour of intergovernmental cooperation within this area .
the plan was successful .
that is why we support this report .
the report was not available until the meeting itself .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the decision )
i should therefore like to thank the commission for any support it can give us with regard to this matter .
madam president , one request and two questions .
we have two questions for the commission .
nothing remains but for the council , or within the council , one member state in particular , to reach a decision .
it is a major growth market .
you must never , never give up on this one .
i want to say why .
that is therefore something completely different .
madam president , i wanted to ask the commissioner another question .
can you tell me what your experience is in this regard , your assessment of the situation ?
the joint debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is a very serious question .
this may present a technical problem , but it has been accepted with a resolution as a commission proposal .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i wish to end with a comment concerning the procedure .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this report is part of a joint debate on a number of proposals relating to fishing .
in my view that is unacceptable !
mr president , today we have before us five reports on which we have to rule .
but something has to happen !
we have to avoid it at all costs !
that is why our group will not support this type of amendment .
that is why the green group will vote against these agreements .
thank you , mr president , and thank you , madam commissioner , for being here today .
in conclusion , i also wish to refer to the council of ministers .
mr president , this has been a good debate and it is important for certain member states .
that is why it is important that these agreements be seen in the light of future opportunities which may not always exist in the future .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we did not support the report . this position is based on a matter of principle .
welcome
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
agenda
( parliament approved the request )
enlargement - agenda 2000
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i would like to bring up a few essential points .
but they are taking part in the same competition .
it will take a long time .
mr president , i am not going to go on much longer .
what is our contribution to the development of peace ?
what are the consequences of the treaty of amsterdam for the union 's budget ?
but what will happen , ladies and gentlemen , if not all the points in the proposal are approved ?
( applause )
i would now like to turn to the subject of the european conference .
we express this not only in words , but also in action .
the commission , would also like to say a few words about turkey .
in this sense we have found a very good solution .
europe is not just the european union of today !
we must open up this parliament !
( applause )
what has happened to that today ?
yet it is a country that is important to europe .
that is why it is important that turkey is included in the european conference .
first , as you have said , mr president-in-office , this enlargement is an opportunity for europe and for ourselves .
the question of turkey is a more difficult one .
the european union will have to support them to a far greater extent .
does agenda 2000 , at least , finally open up this debate ?
all three are small countries .
i hope they will make it by the time the union has made the necessary institutional reforms .
thank you !
that is what i want too .
as far as institutional matters are concerned , we ask that the necessary reforms ( which were not adopted at amsterdam ) should be carried out before enlargement takes place .
the commission has done its job .
the countries in the second group know very well that the road to accession will be a long one for them .
for these reasons , we , as the european parliament , have a great political responsibility .
so it is fundamental that negotiations should start with all those countries which respect the political and democratic criteria .
others have already said enough about all the other issues .
it needs an instrument of political cooperation .
but to have two minutes in which to present to you the opinion of the committee on agriculture and rural development on two such important reports , you will agree , i am sure , is very little .
this is therefore something which we must take into serious consideration .
this is included in the resolution .
it is precisely that which we must avoid .
the " how ' has been discussed by the committee for employment and social affairs in its opinion , and proposals have been made .
it is this conclusion which is now before the full house for a decision to be made .
i would like to deal with two points here .
in that context the required initiatives and the required support should be set up .
new member states should receive support for this process .
the commissioner said it was one process , but the commission still has a start group as part of its strategy .
i do not understand that if you are talking about equal opportunity .
i thank them for this initiative .
from the technical point of view , it has been difficult to get a lot of information .
the committee has not been fully with me on this point .
it is not the purpose of our committee to do that .
that is not our purpose either .
speaking on the budget , on behalf of the committee on institutional affairs , it is clear that we are far from that .
for the committee on institutional affairs , it is very clear that this is a short term view .
that means that other things must be put in the place of fishing in the areas concerned .
if not , this is of no importance and i will stop .
that is quite a lot to take on .
we must also make it clear that the european union has to change .
enlargement to the east is already having its budgetary consequences and will continue to do so when the new countries have become members of the european union .
the others should be given all possible help by the eu to get there .
nothing like it has ever been seen before .
that is quite right and proper .
we do not talk about that !
all that is true .
where were the member states in the past ?
i did not see them there !
our situation is much more difficult .
thank you , mr commissioner .
i have already been asked about it several times .
is there going to be more of that ?
that is what is being decided now .
the fundamental question is this : is there to be a joint start to negotiations or not ?
another key question is whether the new member states will have a say in the eu 's future or not .
the accession process must therefore be part of a peace process .
many people want to have more members , but still the same eu .
we should not be trying to implement structural or agricultural policy or any other type of policy through this report .
for those who make the effort to do so , they will see parliament at its best .
the last thing i want to say is about turkey .
for that , two conditions are necessary .
we had to pay for it .
enlargement has a cost , we must say how we are going to achieve it .
let me state that for the political project of the union , the market is not sufficient .
we want a political union , we want a successful enlargement .
certainly not in reality !
i want enlargement !
i really want it , but if i really want it then i have to make it possible .
the same applies to the structural policy .
i support the report , no problem .
i would like to make another point with regard to accession .
i have another question .
they either are or are not .
that is , i believe , sometimes a difficult situation .
that must not happen !
second point : the reform of the institutions .
that too must not happen .
the european commission may aim for overall regulations .
i agree that the matter of turkey is open for debate .
mr president , i welcome the great role that parliament has in the process of agenda 2000 .
in the context of agenda 2000 we did not ask ourselves this question .
the commission is also right in its report , agenda 2000 , to point out that some countries are further down the road to accession than others .
might one ask what reasons there are for a joint accession process ?
is this what we really want ?
stability ?
security ?
human rights ?
we hope so .
therefore a common start to negotiations should be made with all at the same time .
that is a very important aspect .
now , i believe that we do not have to or are able to draw any conclusions from this in view of the fact that the european commission will also have to make further proposals .
thank you very much mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
you are a member of that committee .
this is not an issue to consider today .
that is the freedom of a compromise , i believe .
as rapporteur i am in any case against this .
that is the issue .
but i will be pleased to go along with your proposal .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , we have been following this vote with great interest .
this is also the view of the european commission .
i do not know .
so that is the text which applies if it is adopted .
on paragraph 15
it was on paragraph 15 .
it is in the voting list and you left it out .
so it was not in order to vote on an amendment to it .
in that case , we vote for .
you just have to ask for a vote on the amendments as well .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
they do not get the necessary or possible help to help themselves .
europe must be open to everyone .
we want to have a europe of all the nations .
we are not prepared to increase costs in the eu 's budget .
we think new member states should be given a say in the development of the eu .
for these reasons i cannot support the report .
however , i cannot support the demand for another intergovernmental conference before enlargement can begin .
we have always voted in favour of enlargement .
in our view , there should be at least three criteria for enlargement .
first , on the single currency .
what do we find ?
we are in favour of enlargement .
i have therefore voted no to the report .
i quite agree with the committee in those views .
this report is based on three fundamental points .
the first is the issue of the euro council .
that means it must look at issues like employment .
that is just one side of the matter .
it is not the kind of thing you simply do in three years .
such a process takes a long time .
we must go further .
the political problem is a different problem .
to what level ?
but i think this is the direction europe should take and will take in the future .
right .
the debate is closed .
we will now move to the vote on the report .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
does the commission think that it will be in a position to make decisions on these important practical issues by may 1998 ?
i would like to take up three points .
the rapporteur has just done this .
yet a considerable part of this has not been taken up .
in addition to this there are two further problems .
but the commission should also think again .
i think it is an excellent report .
in this respect i would like to address two principles .
let us hope that this will be the case in the future .
in view of the structural funds reforms we should think of a different course for structural policy .
as for your concerns about the reforms of the structural fund after 1999 i would simply refer you to the basic statement of the commission in agenda 2000 .
thank you , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we shall now move to the vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
are there any comments ?
mr president , a point of order .
for this to be the case , the rules of procedure state that there has to be a change to the agenda , which obviously has not happened at the moment .
mr president , on a point of order .
i was going to make the same point .
there will be no resolution or vote .
you were there as i was .
i would like to ask you why things have taken so long .
( the minutes were approved )
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the following amendments have been proposed :
there is no problem .
no ?
( parliament approved the proposal )
things are different for different sectors and different for different companies .
however , that is not enough .
i would also like to address the area of equal opportunities .
what the commission says is positive .
who takes part in the negotiations ?
in that sense we are also prepared to support the report tomorrow .
i hope that the commission will take this into account when developing the proposals further .
then we move on to training .
i would like to stress a few points here .
my second point concerns equal opportunities for women .
do not you think so ?
finally , i want to go into a much discussed issue .
there are some major questions on the european agenda in the coming years .
mr president , the commission green paper does not offer anything new .
and how !
mr president , i would like to welcome the report .
the commission is going to follow up the green paper over the next year .
only today there is a meeting of the employment and social ministers .
the debate is closed .
i believe there are two reasons for this .
women 's rights are human rights .
thank you very much .
we must have their support .
i go along with that .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report .
several of the measures are common to both areas .
ecu 3 million is good , but it does not go very far .
all the member states of the union are involved in one or more projects .
we have also heard demands for a convention .
we must therefore do what we can to keep this issue on the agenda .
through today 's debate the european parliament has made an important contribution for which i thank you .
the debate is closed .
they are all going away !
but it is important and it is therefore welcome .
the debate is closed .
it could be done at european level , or at national level .
we do not favour this .
as yet there are still no clear provisions for this and the commission has still not come up with a proposal .
i think it is good that this parliament will be able to find something about it in the text .
at the relevant meeting , five other amendments were agreed .
this is no way to encourage the development of new jobs .
i would like to congratulate parliament and the council for their efforts to find a compromise .
on the basis of the report , the european parliament and the council shall consider and reach a decision within three years .
the debate is closed .
we do not have this situation within the european union any longer .
with the implementation of the directive , now is the time to act on this issue .
so i put my question to the commission , mr commissioner .
mr president , first , thank you for the questions .
this is what we are working on at present .
that is what i wanted to say about the questions .
this is not the case .
so , we are actually doing more than we have to .
this is not clear to me in your reply .
this makes the agreement unacceptable to me .
now you say we need them .
i would like to state this here and now .
the debate is closed .
mr president , mr commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there are not many of you left .
the commission has approved this , too .
this has been our objective .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
could we find out from the commission if this is the case ?
we are not going to return to yesterday 's debate .
( the minutes were approved ) .
are there any other comments ?
there we have it , madam president .
i would like a reply !
that is quite simply what i wanted to say .
madam president , i would like to believe you , and i do believe you .
i do not understand .
i really do not understand .
i think that is the least i can do .
( applause )
i would like an answer on this .
madam president , i have another point of order .
i now have a question for you as president .
it must be possible to ask this kind of question .
madam president , i will not go back to the matter i raised here .
that is why i have not had a reply .
draft budget for 1998
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i would particularly like to mention the success we had with the 1998 budget in the area of agriculture .
this is a success of our negotiations .
we have achieved our priorities in the area of culture and education .
but here the commission , which also has something to say on the issue , was not really involved .
in terms of the other institutions , including our own , there have been no amendments by the council to our budget .
we considered this essential .
the second point is on the amendments from the agriculture committee which have been taken up to a large extent by parliament and the council of ministers .
clearly it is not very much .
we still need to debate this , however .
i would like to thank very much my colleagues on the budgets committee for their cooperation throughout this year .
thank you , mr president-in-office of the council .
it will decide after the opinion of parliament has been adopted .
there are other thanks which need to be given because of the nature of this budget .
then both we and the council will look to the commission to bring forward that proposal .
the last is parliament 's role .
mr president , you referred to that .
that is for specific resolution of a problem .
we do not have that yet ; we will need to do that .
this year i think they have been successful .
i would like also to address the president of the council .
the employment initiative has been one example .
and let me just say something about agriculture .
then we will decide .
we all know that unemployment is structural .
we cannot vote for this proposal .
what did we expect from this budget ?
every new business : three new jobs in the european union .
we achieved this as well .
mr president , i thank the council for its close cooperation .
i shall end there , mr president .
the legal basis , to which many of you have referred , is an important fact .
so parliament must vote for the amendment this time to allow this programme to be put into effect .
we hope the national governments will follow the example we have set .
the state cannot do it .
therefore , it makes a positive contribution to the future development of the european budget .
each side has made its own contribution to compromise .
we have expressed our priorities .
i think we should be pleased about all that .
and if so , this is due to many people .
the debate is closed .
progress in the areas of justice and home affairs
that is a good procedure .
i think we have achieved some positive results from working together .
no doubt there are still demands in this area .
there will be questions to deal with here as well , mr president-in-office .
i will just mention one .
( applause )
we were not successful .
but this is not enough .
here too , and once again , i would like to thank you for giving me the floor .
it is a matter of increased security and safety for citizens .
these questions are very much in focus .
that is of course not acceptable .
all the member states of the eu are now involved in projects in one way or another .
that is what concerns people today .
welcome
as part of this framework , it requires all our attention .
i will therefore vote in favour of the proposal as now put forward by the commission to the european parliament .
among other things , the internal control systems do not work .
this is entirely positive , but does not really go far enough .
however much more needs to be done .
we accept the need to act in respect of the trade in women , but we believe this should be done at intergovernmental level .
this is an international problem , and so it is important that the commission should take the initiative .
that is not good for the debate .
thank you !
good things , therefore , during the past year .
what might happen and what should happen in the future ?
this is necessary .
there is enough to do .
mr president , something new has happened in the area of justice this year .
this is absolutely essential and we all welcome it .
i want to refer to three points .
thank you for that !
a lot has been agreed between the member states and just as much has still to be implemented .
people always , or rather , often , say that the parliament is not on the same side as the council .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
so we should all be in agreement on the procedure for voting .
which aspects have been especially significant to us as a parliament ?
the members too need support with the scientific research behind their political work .
we have discussed often enough what this term actually means .
point six : a few words on the question of funding .
there is transparency in everything here , too .
like the commission , we hope we can achieve a majority vote on council , because this is important .
i hope they will be taken into consideration .
all of us will have different views as to what is important .
for me , it is how we can make the research programme create jobs .
it is really how we use the research .
we need to pay more attention to that .
they are not able to go out and find out what is going on .
i speak too for the committee on fisheries .
i am sure the commission will take note .
eu research must itself promote employment and social cohesion in europe .
for this , much thanks .
for my country , actions to further international cooperation and better results are still of fundamental importance .
industry must therefore also to a large extent be involved .
mr president , i too should like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work .
i have tabled an amendment which i would ask parliament to accept .
i therefore would like to say that i do congratulate her on her excellent work .
so they should be , but let us look above all at what the member states are doing .
even so , i would support four amendments .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for this report .
why ?
efforts need to be made in the member states and in the companies .
that is what it is all about .
at least i would like to think so .
we must increase safety .
what has happened ?
what is it all about ?
now , content .
we have not reached the end of the road , and we have still a long way to go .
the council must now give its opinion .
the debate is closed .
energy policy
finally , the energy sector is of vital importance with respect to the protection of the environment .
the framework programme is also necessary for the creation of a clear legal basis for all of these actions .
the proposal for the framework programme will be one of the basic priorities of the british presidency .
question time ( commission )
it is not our responsibility .
let me just take up one more question .
is the commissioner aware of this ?
what is the commissioner 's basic position on this ?
a report from you on this issue would be very welcome .
it should not happen that way .
i thank the commissioner for his reply .
for the time being no ban has been implemented by the member states in general .
as soon as the information is available the necessary action will be taken .
and why , after two years , has this still not been done ?
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
we have given them further information .
this was successful .
they will no longer exist .
mr president , it seems to me - and this really a point of order - that a question should be given a response .
i wish to thank the commissioner for his answer .
there is no problem in that .
the member states , however , must also fund these additional costs .
that is why things do not always balance out .
that would deal with these difficulties .
subject : commission document on road safety
i would like to thank the commissioner for his answer .
i also believe that it will help the transport cooperation which is currently taking place in the various member states .
i think it appropriate to particularly draw attention to this at this time of year .
i would not want to be more specific than that .
this concerns questions about to the role of the european investment bank in all of this .
there are many of us who would be against this .
unfortunately the member states could not reach agreement on this either .
allow me to make a few comments .
now let me say something about the individual points .
we have three or four areas to consider .
are you prepared to do this for the european union ?
what is to be done ?
its rapporteur is also here .
that cannot be right .
that cannot be right , it cannot be good .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his statement .
this is our objective .
it must protect the interests of all member states .
we have reached a stage where something has to be done .
i should like to ask the commissioner the following points .
i have one final question as the commissioner for the environment is here .
is that true ?
there are still needs now .
i will be the first to support it when there is one .
i expect the commission to take action against it .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i only want to speak on a few points which have been made here .
in fact that has been our approach .
we are therefore in a new situation , and must now do an appropriate assessment , discuss it in the commission and make a decision .
we are therefore trying to take full account of those difficulties .
thank you !
however , i would like to make three comments .
so we have to find some form of agreement .
but if you do not want us here , we will not come any more .
it was supported by five countries .
that is the situation .
the debate is closed .
there is no clear , specific legal basis in the treaty .
what remains to be done in this context ?
it is essential that these are done .
what we need in the end is an energy tax .
in the end we must use all possible means to continue to develop these .
this is not the answer .
we really have to move energy issues up the political agenda .
that is an area where we have to make a much greater effort .
the debate is closed .
we agree .
those are the first two principles .
let me also mention two more principles .
it is essential that we do not have a period without legislation in this field .
it is quite simply unacceptable .
that is no longer so .
there are of course many different reasons for this .
i am therefore going to vote for the report .
it is the only country not to have done so .
the commission has made proposals for that .
you may think what you like about them .
if there is a majority in the council of ministers to do this earlier , that will not be a problem for the commission .
the debate is closed .
services of general interest in europe
i thank colleagues for that .
it will be the very first time that parliament has achieved a common position on public services .
i hope that we can do it .
they are there for the public .
the commission should do something about this .
mr president , services of general interest in europe are necessary and important .
i would like us to reach a good joint conclusion even without paragraph 12 .
i hope that then we will really have services of general interest in the european union which we can accept in both form and content .
in the field of public services , that has not happened for a very long time .
we are not only consumers .
another point made the debate a difficult one .
we have put forward amendments on two points only .
that we accept .
mr president , i welcome this debate and i welcome very much the commission 's communication on which it is based .
she has done some very good work .
what matters is the service itself .
why ?
but what have we seen ?
it is free to air .
for this reason , our group has put forward some amendments , which we hope will be adopted to improve this text .
water is obviously a public service .
and that is the basis of democracy .
i think , as little as possible .
first , it must ensure internal and external security .
that is in no way the case .
here too , i ask you to give me one example .
that is wrong .
just take a little look around you .
was that the case ?
obviously we are prepared to do so .
this is how we have to work together .
the debate is closed .
the third issue is human health , an especially important aspect .
there was also a majority on this point in parliament at first reading .
what could we have done ?
we should also decide on it in parliament .
this is an unacceptable situation .
perhaps there might be a response to that .
will there be a competition ?
indeed , this is an important question .
as at first reading , the commission cannot accept them .
i really cannot understand that .
that is the principle adopted .
this is a question which is the responsibility of each of the member states .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
we consider that turkey is a great european state .
mr president , let me say a word about turkey .
why ?
i think not .
it has been an excellent six months for europe .
much other progress has been achieved over these last six months , but i will stop here .
it is now my task to give an account of the council 's activities .
the european union is a community of values and objectives .
this return was achieved through group solidarity .
at the end of my third presidency of the council , i would above all like to thank and congratulate all of my colleagues .
once again they have given of their best for europe .
that applies particularly to reform of the institutions .
we must discuss them !
( applause )
first , i want to consider the employment summit .
i congratulate you on this .
that applies to the enlargement .
i will make four comments .
next we have the british presidency , and i believe that many of the initiatives which have been taken during the past six months will be taken forward by the british presidency .
the way to achieve this has been decided .
that should have been said clearly .
the second problem was the enlargement of europe .
this is wrong .
why is this not used ?
we would like to thank the rapporteur for the report .
we must continue to put pressure on the united states to play fair .
i therefore give the report my full support .
what is it about ?
it is up to the commission to guarantee the free market and i call on it to do so !
progress in the area of justice and home affairs
european cooperation in the area of security seems to us absolutely essential - at least in its intergovernmental form .
let us hope when we discuss this issue next year we will be able to report that real progress has been made .
we can but congratulate them for this .
and the citizens of europe could not accept this .
people of europe will thank us for voting through this report .
allow me to say a word more on the work of the presidency in other essential areas .
( applause )
but that has consequences .
very much remains to be done , too much .
that is how serious it is .
what matters now is to see whether something can be achieved with specific agreements .
what does this mean for the future ?
the results are extremely important .
as far as that is concerned , my thanks .
the main concern of the citizens of europe is now also the main subject of those who are responsible for government , that is the fight against unemployment .
i mean here a positive decision about the presidency of the european central bank .
this is an important process .
i have three small points .
firstly , turkey .
i would like to hear it again from the president-in-office of the council .
then there is the issue of the european central bank .
i understand the groups ' problem .
it must be said that , in fact , only four or five member states agreed with this idea being mentioned .
i believe that we must be in a position to bring the discussion to a close .
initiatives will be taken before the end of the year to try to bring this problem to a conclusion .
the commission will apply itself to this , as will others .
if we no longer like europe , institutional reforms will not get us very far .
the debate is closed .
i do not think so .
obviously , transparency cannot be achieved by this means alone , since the treaty also demands a specific legislative initiative .
we will also present an action programme for justice and internal affairs , as soon as we can .
parliament must be involved in next year 's programme , and its development .
perhaps they are not quite aware of what use it may be , or they do not know if it will have any true political impact .
in our institutional system , the commission has the right of legislative initiative .
it does not respect its own programme .
we have nothing against this way forward as such .
up until now , nothing has been provided .
we would at least know where we stand if they did this .
that is a political fact .
you will not hear me say that the commission has not done anything .
that was one point .
why are you not able to clear things much more quickly , or in any case tell parliament about it ?
the commission proposed it .
we must also make sure that we help the commission to use its existing powers as much as possible .
i believe this is one of the problems of the work on the legislative and work programme for the commission during next year .
a difficult question .
we said no .
but where is the proper legislation about it ?
i am not prepared to accept that .
i will just take an example from the transport field .
we want to talk to you about that , but not in a general debate about the environment and air transport !
the commission took initiatives .
mr president , mr commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i have two points of view .
and so to the points which i am less positive about and where i want to know more .
the other point concerns freedom of movement .
and all the more so once parliament 's powers are increased by the treaty of amsterdam .
there is no reason why we should not do that .
at this moment , i cannot give you a response to all the matters which have been raised here .
some are legislative matters and others are not .
you are absolutely right .
it is a very serious problem .
so you think we should have done it already ?
so i have made a note of your concern .
it is one of the results of amsterdam .
i think this is a really important and significant matter .
no , let us do it now .
well , those are some of the things i wanted to say to you .
but that is what the community is like , and has always been like .
however , i think we have been shown a way forward , and we are going to try to do it .
mr president , this really is a point of order .
question time ( council )
mr president , i only have quite a short question .
i have heard that it is not the first proposal .
i have taken note of what you said regarding the commission proposal .
can i congratulate you on a successful presidency ?
our support is not a support in principle .
thank you , mr president-in-office of the council .
mr president , thank you for your clear statement .
it is a reply within his terms of reference .
does he not think that they should be supported throughout europe ?
with regard to the specific initiatives referred to , these can only be taken on the basis of proposals in due form from the commission .
mr president-in-office , thank you for the answer .
they are available to parliament .
i am concerned about precisely the same thing .
i would like to have a comment from you on that .
i also welcome his initiative in relation to the employment summit .
so much for the respect that the commission has for this house .
could i have an answer on this from the president-in-office of the council ?
it is true that all of these issues should have been discussed at the time the council took its decision .
i believe , furthermore , that i was president of the council .
we welcome these amendments .
finally , a number of additional amendments have been tabled .
the debate is closed .
this is not the case .
we therefore call upon common sense .
something is not right .
and i have not mentioned cultural policy !
but this is no reason not to make peace .
anything can happen in this parliament ; anything can happen in this world .
anything can happen in this world .
therefore , i congratulate you .
here you have the response from european society , from european farmers , to the committee 's proposals .
i am concerned about the amendments that have been put forward .
madam president , much has been said thus far but i , in turn , would like congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
there is another really important subject .
i would like to thank all my colleagues from the parliamentary groups for the efforts they have made to present a common approach .
i shall be taking part in that debate .
i would like to see us working on that .
i certainly hope that i will be involved in this work on behalf of my group .
initiatives from the industry on this are welcome .
i only hope that a proposal will not be too long in coming .
it is therefore appropriate to set the debate back in its true context .
however they are a welcome contribution to the overall plan of action .
i am against this request .
not so !
and i would have let you speak if you had made such a request .
you have now done just that .
we will now continue the debate .
but in this case it is not possible .
it is an excellent report .
we will not discuss this .
for that reason i do not like being called something i am not .
the matter is closed as far as i am concerned .
i do not want to discuss what happened any further .
i share your opinion and i shall of course report this .
so what are we do to about it ?
i believe that is the main question .
but how can we protect our children ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is something i really want to stress .
so no good will come of it .
if you can not get the best , take what is good .
this is not enough if we look at the agreements we made earlier .
we must vote against this .
i would quite simply like to draw your attention to that .
they have already taken things much further .
is this true ?
parliament has to decide whether it is better to have the agreement or not to have the agreement .
therefore this is an effective measure . it does not go the whole way .
only the agreement can do that .
the fact of the matter is that we all share the same commitment .
but i should like to see them do better .
the debate is closed .
i agree with that entirely .
something should be done about this .
we said so at the time .
the debate is closed .
so long , in fact , that the rapporteur has had time to change .
however , there are also a few problems .
on the other hand , the responsibility for how they are supported is still a democratic matter , and so democratic control is still needed .
it is good that there is now a clear regulation .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
statement by the president
i just did not want to believe what i had heard .
( parliament approved the president 's motion )
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
mr president , i have the following comment to make .
i would like to know how and on what basis this issue was decided .
so the european parliament has nothing to do with this issue , which is completely private .
and i find what we have heard unacceptable .
i do not want to talk about what took place earlier .
thank you , mr president .
i would request that you take note of two comments which have to be made before we move on to voting .
( the president-in-office of the council agreed )
this is in fact a good budget .
that is why the rapporteur has not expressed an opinion .
thank you .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i will try to ensure that you do .
after the vote on amendment no 2
that is all i want to say about the amendment which has just been voted on here .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
however , i do not think that is the case .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
a legal basis is required to be able to pay out the funds .
as far as the budget resolution is concerned we are voting for amendments nos 3 and 4 .
however , this is not enough .
we have voted no to the report .
parliament 's presidency is working on these questions .
only when there is a whole to decide on will parliament be able to make a decision .
so i can therefore give the report my full support .
energy policy must be under democratic control .
european council
what does the treaty say ?
but it is in fact significant that only three member states are involved .
so , what is the solution ?
but they are wrong .
unfortunately , turkey did not do so either .
turkey is not one of those countries .
commission programme
but that question has not been raised .
you would see nothing but work going on .
the question we have to consider today is a very important one .
what is the purpose of this report ?
so it is important so support the commission in its work towards new and effective reforms in agriculture .
these are the points in question :
a solution has to be found for this .
that is why i supported amendment no 2 .
i believe that several aspects are more appropriate for action by member states with a measure of cooperation .
our group voted against the final resolution in this report .
i believe the result is a positive one for the global environment .
this line was supported by the united states .
i am sure you will agree with me that this is not an acceptable situation .
the agreed text is not very clear on this point .
we have no time to waste .
within 11 months from now the world will again have to take crucial decisions .
the support from the european parliament is essential in the future as it has been important in the past .
better coordination between parliament , me and my services should start right now .
but it was a first step .
the situation in germany was a special one .
i hope cooperation between parliament and the commissioner will continue .
but the most vital work to be done is here at home .
what is the result ?
we must aim for a new model for economic development .
she has had that experience and so have some of our colleagues .
going as individual countries we would not have had the effect that we did have .
that means they cannot see the world clearly .
nuclear energy is not the answer .
you cannot .
the time has come now for that idea .
i am very pleased that we have had this report .
it does not mean because there are few people that it is not taken seriously .
this will not be the last we hear of it .
madam president , i would like to say thank you for the many positive comments which have been made .
i look forward to further discussions on this matter in parliament .
can the commissioner give a response to this ?
thank you , madam commissioner .
the implementation is important .
but in any case i hope i may look forward to the new joint actions by the council .
we have seen a lot of progress made .
these are all very welcome developments .
there are four things that we need to do .
thank you .
a ban is not enough , however .
of course , the process is not yet over .
the joint debate is closed .
the united nations must act .
yet the compromise is extremely important .
the debate is closed .
so what is to be done now ?
let me tell you something about him .
and how could this be done ?
when we were there recently , we found out how serious the situation was .
there are a number of proposals in the resolution .
in fact there is not a single mention of it in the resolution .
the joint debate is closed
the next item is the joint debate on :
so far , so good .
the other question is , of course , the question of resources .
i do not have enough time to mention all the conclusions .
this is a good thing .
aid is the means of the policy , not an end in itself .
i would be very pleased if the commissioner could answer this point .
people expect that of us , and in this area we also have strong public support .
i believe that this has become quite clear .
i believe that this is very important .
this proposal is set out in our amendment .
now it is time for these principles to be implemented at national and local level .
we have to establish some kind of order here .
i shall now comment on some more general points .
the reasons are various .
and sometimes it is because of the question of access to money for the particular project .
of course there are sometimes .
there is not much point in doing something in this area if people do not know what is going on .
the monitoring of elections has been referred to .
no .
the joint debate is closed .
finally , i would to like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
the debate is closed .
what is the point of all this ?
many also believe that this common foreign and defence policy is much further developed than is actually the case .
but let us accept things just as they are .
we must therefore be allowed to develop this agreement further .
i would therefore like to make it clear that parliament does not want to make foreign policy .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
it is approved .
( parliament adopted the proposal )
as i say , expenditure is decided and the major decisions are taken at intergovernmental level , even though the community budget is often called upon .
the answer , in my opinion , is no .
why can you not make a proposal at last ?
i do not quite understand that .
we welcome all this , but why has it taken so long ?
however , i have a few more questions for the commission .
this is necessary both for industry and for consumer protection .
in this connection , i would like to ask you another question , madam commissioner .
who is responsible for this situation in legal terms , commissioner ?
it is clear that the debate will not end here .
so why was that not possible ?
if this regulation does come into force then , will it apply to products which are new at that time ?
we all agree on this , certainly .
not a word has been said about this !
there is nothing in the regulations , we do not know what this could do to our health , nor do we know what effect it could have on the environment .
so what has the commission to say today ?
i think this is essential .
this is what european consumers want - and they are quite right in this .
mr president , madam commissioner , the commissioner said that we need more time , but i would like to say that the time is already up .
now to my last point .
but this is not the case , and i said so earlier .
of course this regulation will be hard to apply , as mentioned earlier .
so this debate is far from over .
as i said before , it is in fact the member states which are responsible for the application of the regulation .
the joint debate is now closed .
but there is one problem , and this , as so often , is in the field of democracy and human rights .
that is what we want to achieve .
i think that the members of the committee would like the commission to give us more information about this as soon as possible .
it may take a long time .
human rights have been mentioned here again and again .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that is what we must focus on .
so how can the commission adopt a position since we have not yet received any response .
as we do not have any information , we cannot make a response .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
thank you very much , mr president .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the question is the more important , mr president , as it does not only concern relations between the commission and this parliament .
the commission may have the floor , to express their view on this .
( the order of business was adopted )
let me make a few general comments on this subject .
i would like to say something about this .
so we have to ask ourselves : how have we reached this situation ?
we cannot agree to this .
in this , governments will play a different , but no less important role .
i want to address this paper on that basis .
hard political decisions must be made now .
that is part of what is wrong with our transport system .
i would however like to make the following points .
what direction is the commission going in ?
i want a clear direction .
what is the direction of the commission ?
from this point of view , the answer may be more significant .
this is a very important point .
i have two points that i would like to put to the commissioner , if you would allow me .
the debate is closed .
the council did not accept the amendments from the european parliament on this issue .
one further point , which seems important to me but which has not been raised , is of course competition .
the debate is closed .
for although private investment is essential , it is not enough .
ten years ago , we did not know what it was .
and the role of the commission ?
mr president , firstly , may i congratulate the rapporteur .
we are not talking about military research and development . that point is quite clearly made .
i think we in the european parliament should prevent that .
the social conditions in our countries demand it .
we can be absolutely sure of that .
to that end we will continue to use regulation and legislation .
the debate is closed .
the first concerns the text proposed to the house .
the european parliament will have a role to play in this procedure .
it is not for me to comment here on the quite specific nature of the whole of the procedure .
on this subject , there is an agreement between the commission , the council and the european parliament .
parliament can then make all of the political points that it needs to make .
in fact i believe this is the only possible solution given the pressure of time under which we have to work .
the debate is closed .
that will no longer be possible .
madam president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report .
they were a significant step forward .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i have made a note of your comments .
( parliament approved the minutes )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
so much the better !
there are few legal questions raised in connection with this report .
i would therefore like to hear your views .
today i would like to set out some of the priorities for my group over the coming years .
we want to ensure that the european bank is independent .
my last point is in relation to the citizens and the consumer .
a central issue for the external role of the euro is stability .
just one rate !
i would like yet again to clear up one thing .
we cannot just see our citizens as consumers .
we need an effective european employment policy .
secondly , what currency policy should be adopted in the management of the european currency ?
the market will do so . and from that point of view , the european central bank will have a role to play .
will the euro answer this question ?
i think not .
will it be ?
mr president , i have three comments to make .
our answer to both questions is " no ' .
three years is really too long .
this a serious issue on which we can ask for action .
my colleagues have already discussed other points , or will do so .
mr commissioner , i have a second question .
we also need to encourage people to feel good about the single currency .
so there are opportunities for europe in this field .
confidence of the markets is not enough .
we need the confidence of the people .
indeed , the euro is coming .
for this reason clearly its success is extremely important .
and so we will have to work together to provide information for the consumer and training for business .
rightly so , because this is the point at which the real problems and the real debate take place .
that is also the wish of your rapporteur .
all these questions will be given an appropriate response in the next few months .
this is what the commission is working on at present .
in 1998 , the commission will make a proposal for a directive on this subject .
of course this is important , but this is not the only means of consumer information .
finally , i come to your rapporteur 's second concern .
finally , consumer protection was mentioned many times this morning .
mr president , i asked the commissioner a very specific question , and i do not believe i received a reply .
we have problems with this .
i am in agreement with her on the objective and , i hope , on the means to achieve it .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
' .
' .
i am in total agreement with the rapporteur .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
however , this approach is not appropriate .
it should come into force in a few months .
it is also important not to reduce public funding of research , but rather to increase it .
this is a decision which we support .
no such thing !
that is the real question .
economic and monetary union is going to lead to increased demand for a more common financial and tax policy .
europe has a great deal going for it .
consumer confidence is vital to the success of the single currency .
but , of course , the consumers and citizens of the european union also need to get used to using the euro .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we need to be clear that we are not talking about a treaty .
i think this is very important .
i would like to mention a few points .
europe itself did not take the opportunity during the council of amsterdam .
they are also in a position to take practical initiatives .
as i have already said , human rights should have priority over business interests .
what are we to do ?
certainly not .
mr president , i would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
we are currently going through this change .
at times it is rather difficult .
that may once have been true , but it is certainly no longer the case today .
it is for this reason that this dialogue is so important .
in the context of the application of world trade regulations , i call for greater transparency in the application of these measures .
that is why parliamentary control by the european parliament is so necessary .
mr president , of course the different aspects of the relations between the european union and the united states are not at the same level .
i would like to address some comments to the commission .
we then have the creation of the euro .
we need to find a way of making it even better .
all these are difficult questions .
i would say that they are very high .
he has asked me to present the commission 's views and his own here today .
it can only help .
we must avoid such a situation .
the debate is closed .
i would like to ask the commissioner a question in connection with the legal basis .
if we do not do that , we take the risk that consumers will not get sufficient information .
i hope this important principle will also have an impact on other eu rules .
so we shall have to see what we can do here .
i would like to refer to the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
however , coming back to this fund , commissioner , if such a fund were to be established , would it be new money ?
can you tell me , will it be new money if such a fund is established ?
subject : single market
that , mr president , is the answer i would like to give the honourable member .
i want to ask you a number of questions relating to that .
then there is no need for the commission to act .
i wanted to give as full a reply as possible .
thank you very much for your answer , mr commissioner , which indeed was very full .
that has happened .
no , i do not think so .
at this stage , the governments will have to answer for their actions before public opinion , before their partners , to see whether or not they have reached their objectives .
i would like to thank you for your reply .
and there are objectives and means , for the coordination of economic policy .
well , what does article 2 say ?
employment policy is furthermore the priority policy of the european union .
i would like there to be more balance between price stability and growth .
we do not want it done like that . that is not the right way to work on anything , but especially not on culture .
it was a great success .
this is very important for the future !
what is europe , after all ?
i had not included that in the draft directive .
is he going to put some pressure on member states to give him information , to give him a list ?
that is its own decision .
therefore , i am not going to do anything .
the report will also be presented to parliament , of course .
as i said , i fully share the honourable member 's concern .
i thank the commissioner for his reply .
the eu now has access to the legal framework and the possibility of using economic pressure .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
we think the main thing is to promote peace and peace negotiations , between now and the general elections in may .
thank you for your reply .
i agree that the situation in the country is , to say the least , difficult .
so i cannot say that i was particularly pleased to hear that we have an office in the country .
no , no , my position is still the same .
i agree with that european parliamentary resolution .
we are all responsible for our own actions .
how can this be achieved ?
the commission proposal is therefore a step in the right direction .
i ask my colleagues to agree with amendment no 3 .
all the same , i would like to call on the commission to pay attention to this problem as part of eu social policy .
is that true ?
therefore these amendments cannot be supported by the commission .
the debate is closed .
for these reasons , the group of the european people 's party will vote in favour of the amendments and the programme .
mr president , i think at this stage in the debate several things have become clear .
that is very little .
it really is not good enough .
what if we do nothing ?
firstly , i thank parliament for the work that it has done on this issue .
for these reasons we cannot accept the amendment .
the debate is closed .
in connection with the second reading , parliament adopted five amendments .
three of these amendments were unacceptable to both the commission and the council .
the debate is closed .
cohesion and the information society
why am i saying all this ?
so what do i believe ?
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
however , we shall look into the matter .
( the minutes were approved )
it is a hard act to follow .
i understand why they do that .
after all , it is always true .
we have done that .
that is why we are so concerned to make a success out of economic and monetary union and enlargement .
that is why we want to take forward work on jobs , the environment and crime .
the european parliament will , of course , have a key role to play in that decision .
we want economic and monetary union to be a success .
it is a process in which the european parliament will have a crucial role to play .
we have two important but practical objectives for the british presidency on enlargement .
these negotiations have one common purpose : to make a success of enlargement .
i know they are your priorities .
first , employment .
it does not matter in which country you ask the question .
that means one in ten of europe 's young people are without a job .
i believe it can be done and that europe can show how .
the union has a major role in that process .
then we will have a europe that can work for the people , and put the people back to work .
the second major concern for the people is crime .
the last of those concerns is the environment .
the european union transport policy has a major impact on the environment .
let us ensure it is a positive one .
jobs , crime and the environment .
those are the concerns of the people of europe .
those are the priorities for the british presidency .
but there must also be progress on the reform agenda for europe itself .
during our presidency we will want to make sure that work takes place .
but there is much we can agree on .
we want to find out how we can help .
i know you will give us that help .
thank you very much , mr president-in-office of the council .
mrs green now has the floor .
we wish it well .
( applause )
i doubt that very much .
i wish him every success in his presidency on behalf of the people of europe .
a presidency has to show results .
this applies to two areas : monetary issues and foreign policy .
the most important decision for the union under the british presidency is the one about the euro .
the union must also improve cooperation with turkey .
kosovo must be one of the priorities of the british presidency .
and what can members of the european parliament hope for from a british presidency ?
but we need more than that .
if we want to fund enlargement and internal solidarity at the same time , we cannot agree with the commission 's approach in agenda 2000 .
those people need more than words .
that is not enough for those people !
people do not live on money alone .
they need equal opportunities to get work .
social justice is not everything , but without social justice europe is nothing !
this must be the agenda for the british presidency .
for europe as well as at home .
you cannot always get what you want .
but if you try , sometimes you may find that you get what you need !
we can work it out , we can work it out !
life is very short and there is no time .
i would like to turn to some practical questions on the priorities .
the president-in-office did not mention fishing today .
this is the fundamental question .
i have an interest here as an objective 1 area .
( applause )
mr president , i also welcome the president-in-office here this morning .
mr president , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , it is quite difficult for a member to comment when he has only just heard a speech .
but then what ?
mr president-in-office , i believe that your policies are based on good will .
this time it will be different , very different .
there can never be a true european union when we have such high levels of unemployment .
but , as we all know , for enlargement to work , the european union itself has to change .
now we have to have a serious debate about how we can develop a new regional policy to meet the needs of the future , and how of course we are going to reform the common agricultural policy .
these are all important policy objectives that we too would have put high on the agenda .
we hope progress will be made on enlargement .
mr president , i welcome the statement by the president-in-office .
we have to give an answer to this question !
it has nothing under control !
we from the parliament will have to take the same action as you .
the course is now being set for the third stage of economic and monetary union .
that is what is needed .
it is not enough just to talk about control .
that is true .
so does this parliament .
that is true , and we want it too .
we agree .
you are right .
i should like to hear the british presidency saying more about europe as a political project , not just as a market project .
and that is not all .
i would like to focus on employment and social policy .
the second is education and legislation .
and what is the british presidency going to do about this ?
when will i get a reply ?
you have an opportunity here as far as the stability of europe is concerned .
i hope the presidency can take initiatives in that field .
minister , i have two minutes in which to address you .
clearly it cannot be done .
would the groups agree to that ?
of course i will say something about this .
i would like you to tell us , as president-in-office , what you think about this initiative .
these are in fact the three basic issues .
this is the issue which also interests consumers .
in my opinion , mr president , these are the fundamental points .
( applause from the group of the european people 's party )
i have ten minutes .
how much progress are we really making in europe towards training ?
enlargement will be a key part of that process .
but let me say one or two things about the points that have been raised about the specific british position .
thank you very much , president-in-office .
the debate is closed .
there is a human , economic and social cost to this .
this directive is a part of that policy .
the problems are not the same all over europe .
i did not want to mention it yesterday as i did not have any speaking time .
when it is a matter of important problems concerning nature , the environment , production , we have no speaking time .
unfortunately .
it was you who voted for the rules of procedure , not i !
why ?
they expect us to do the same .
here the commission has a vital role to play .
that is the most important issue .
both society and the social partners have a responsibility in this work .
i would like to ask a fundamental question , however .
we do not really have any information on these .
i think that is also clear from the report .
what kind of market economy do we have ?
what market economy do we want ?
i think , and indeed we all hope , that this will now change as a result of the amsterdam guidelines .
the present report , presented today , has three important results .
the debate is closed .
why the workers ?
but we want to see action !
that is good , but i think that we should state very clearly that it cannot progress more quickly than the member states themselves want .
most of them can be developed .
mr president , i am very pleased about this initiative from the commission .
it is also a good idea to set up a working group which should include the social partners .
i think this is a key request which the rapporteur and parliament are making today .
thank you mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but this in itself will not be enough .
as the presidency we will do what we can to achieve this .
this is not acceptable .
there are two points i consider fundamental , the first political , the second legal and institutional in nature .
a commitment from the commissioner on this issue would be important .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this debate concerns political responsibility .
( applause )
the assessment is clear .
that is the first demand .
and as has already been said , we are speaking of 20 million people .
mr president , since i am about to ask the president-in-office a question , i would like him to follow what i am saying .
i would like the president-in-office of the council to follow my speech .
to continue , then .
there are , however , no such proposals .
no !
we do not have to !
do you know what ?
thank you .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
i hope that they can help .
actually , my question concerns precisely the same thing .
what initiatives is the council prepared to take in this direction ?
at some time in the past that may have been true .
the european council agreed that these objectives should be implemented within a period not greater than five years .
unfortunately , the rules of procedure do not allow me to let her do so .
i would point out that this is not a matter for the council but rather for the commission .
i would like to thank the president-in-office of the council of ministers for his reply .
i would like to thank the council for the answer i have received .
at the same time it is a very serious problem .
is the council of ministers prepared to take legislative action ?
not so much a point of order , mr president .
i have to tell him that no decision has yet been reached by the american government though the matter is under consideration .
i would like to make two points in this respect .
i thank the honourable member for his question .
the question of aid is an important issue .
as president-in-office , i do not see that i have access to any special information that would allow me to make a different assessment .
again , welcome to the british labour president-in-office .
i welcome the president-in-office .
thank you very much for your answer .
this just has not happened .
as i have said to other honourable members , this is an important priority of the presidency .
it is a priority of our presidency to try to make progress .
however , at this stage , two things are certain .
i would like to thank the council of minister 's for its reply .
this issue comes up in many member states .
can i say to the honourable member that i understand his concerns .
they are expressed by many throughout the european union .
i very much agree with the point which he has raised and i look forward , like he does , to the commission proposal .
but just how much more has to be done on our part ?
well , this has now been done .
but let me just make two points .
we in the committee on external economic relations support the report .
that is why we cannot support this report .
i believe it is time , in this area too , that there should be a true european political will with regard to this .
that is what is important .
let me take paragraph 15 of the report as an example .
i would refer to two points .
i have two further points to make .
i understand there was a major debate in committee .
the debate is closed .
in any case , mr president , this is a report which i do not think will cause parliament any serious difficulties .
it is always possible to ask for more , but this is already one step forward .
this proposal has been accepted by the committee on fisheries .
but to do this we obviously need money .
two further initiative reports are to follow in 1998 .
you can already see , madam president , that all the political groups and countries support your proposal .
however , his proposal is not what we are discussing here .
the debate is closed .
should there be a specific tax ?
this is the general objective of the proposal .
the debate is closed .
madam president , i would like to speak on a point of order .
madam president , thank you .
drugs
( applause )
there is not .
against ?
obviously you do not have the confidence to open this amendment to discussion or put it to the vote .
we can say no to that by voting no today .
no one wanted to do so .
i do not want to make any more comments on that subject .
all right ?
that is right , is it not ?
that is also a good thing .
i also agree that we should draw up a common framework .
this is , of course , subject to data protection legislation .
therefore , it makes sense to have such a procedure .
asylum is a basic human right .
it is necessary to have an effective and responsible asylum policy in the eu .
the issue is not who should have a right to asylum in the eu .
there should be security and control of the data , both in terms of who has access to it and who is able to use it .
it is here that european internal and foreign affairs policies should meet in order to form an overall , and therefore more effective approach .
that is a fundamental point .
i believe this is not really necessary .
it is an intergovernmental issue and an issue for the member states .
i think that is important .
we have to do something about it .
we did it yesterday , and we are doing it again this morning .
we do not have one .
however , it is not enough to have a legal system for the first asylum principle and for it to be able to work .
we are working within an institutional framework which is in a state of change .
i think that we have now reached an acceptable level of data protection .
the debate is closed .
secondly , without doubt , this has to be set against the question of how far is it necessary to take action .
so as it is , we have community competition which must be put into practice .
indeed it has been put into practice .
however , the commission is in favour of it .
the debate is closed .
we need an agreement .
we want to protect the environment .
that is still unacceptable .
there are also many other issues which play a role in the negotiations .
we can not work together on that basis .
my response is no !
mr president , mr commissioner , it is high time something was done .
this means that we find ourselves in a situation in which we simply have to reach an agreement .
mr president , we meet here today to discuss an important question .
ladies and gentlemen , there is something i wanted to ask you .
mr president , on a point of order .
i should like to ask the presidency to look into this and report back to parliament the full circumstances .
( parliament referred the report back to committee )
those are the two amendments to this amendment .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we would like to thank the rapporteur for his report .
there is no reason why citizens should not know about them .
we also think that cooperation on this kind of issue should be intergovernmental .
with regard to training , young people must be able to keep up with the developments of this new society .
the basic question is well put .
this should be a national priority as well as a european priority .
i hope the commission will reply .
like him , i would like some serious proposals from the commission .
however , we would like to express a view on one point .
we voted against this resolution .
then and only then will new jobs be created .
it will happen again now .
i shall therefore vote against this report .
there is also the question of the environment .
i hope that the matter will be brought to a close under this british presidency .
there 's no way around it .
so , where are the policies which the commission , the parliament and the council should be following ?
i believe that there should be one agreement , not a number of different agreements .
that is why the eu commission and the presidency of the council of europe are being asked to do something about the situation .
the debate is closed .
community aid
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this should therefore be put right .
if so , what is it ?
there are six of these .
this must be put right .
allow me to point out that it is the committee who can and must provide an important political lead .
in the same way there are many other actions which , in addition , we expect from the committee .
and i will put forward , as i see it , the three most important .
that was the first point .
there is now no longer any doubt .
the joint debate is closed .
thank you , mr president .
this is serious .
the joint debate is closed .
because , finally , we do have an instrument in europe .
that is unacceptable .
we must be very clear here .
we are therefore right to be concerned for that reason , and to call for a ban .
will it be available for all ?
and rightly so .
this also applies here .
pressure must be put on these countries .
it is vital .
that is my first point .
we must be quite clear .
it is very difficult situation .
it is therefore about time that the commission made full use of its powers .
there are two very good reasons for this .
these are small things which in my view can have great results .
that is the purpose of this motion for a resolution .
this in itself is positive .
that says something about the situation there .
the joint debate is closed .
mr president , it makes on think .
thank you , mr commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
i support this .
developing nations must trade their way out of financial problems .
but what is the point of such good reports if the framework conditions of the policy are not right ?
many european countries have special relations with certain developing countries .
it is no such thing .
you try to ensure that what you want to give us are the things we need ' .
but at the end of the day that is not the best for humanitarian aid .
that is about making a political statement to get real action : not just to bring another regulation forward , but to start doing something .
this was the first point i wanted to make .
unfortunately , this is not often the case .
which is why the report cannot discuss it .
it is true .
i would like to say , make the best of it .
there it is again .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i would like to draw your attention to the agenda .
however , we will take note of the comments and forward them to the committee .
you are right .
mr president , that also applies to me .
you are right , and the minutes will be put right .
( the minutes were approved )
mr president , it is by no means clear to me what this means .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
what is the reality behind this ?
humanitarian aid must make it possible to look forward to the time when people no longer need it .
europe has been very successful in its food aid programme .
our efforts have not all been successful .
i welcome the commission 's green paper on development aid .
we all know that the time is not one for solidarity and cooperation .
however , nothing is even said about this .
you cannot demand this from these countries ; not yet , in any case .
this makes their position all the more difficult .
thank you very much , mr commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution . )
as far as the day of the week is concerned , not much .
that is not right .
why not ?
just look at today 's report .
it points to the future of the eu after the year 2000 .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the debate about of the reform of the eu structural funds for the period after 1999 is already in full progress .
not so !
i would like the commission to consider that proposal .
that is what we want and what we hope the reform of the structural funds will achieve .
' .
but as far as it goes is not enough .
therefore , in connection with such discussions , the question should finally be raised : who should pay for it ?
madam president , this debate concerns regional policy and an equal europe .
this is very important .
therefore , the high position of the rural areas must be clearly established in agenda 2000 .
i believe that we must do more research in this area .
the second , and perhaps even more important point is education and further education in these areas .
madam president , two words no more .
ladies and gentlemen of the parliament , thank you very much .
that is the way the committee of the regions is made up .
the debate is closed .
that is not what we are here for .
this is a serious european problem .
as far as i know , no committee of this house as yet has brought that to the floor .
are there any comments ?
)
( the minutes were approved )
but this crisis is all about the private sector .
people will again say that my efforts are being put to things other than my work .
this really seems to me to be the role of the international monetary fund .
that is another question .
why is this ?
madam president , i would like to ask two questions .
you have already mentioned it several times .
i will give you an example from my own country .
well , that is what we must prevent .
indeed , a certain number of questions can be raised , but i believe that the members of the commission must be independent .
i would never have agreed to this .
i believe that this is essential .
the debate is closed .
i therefore call upon member states to apply the same measures .
the debate you are trying to start up again has already been closed .
the result is that there will certainly be no majority in favour of our compromise text tomorrow .
mr president , i will be voting against .
mr president , i have a question .
the commission points to some circumstances in the report .
but it must know what it is doing .
this has something to do with democracy .
mr president , monitoring the application of community law is a difficult task , but it is of crucial importance for the european union .
the european parliament 's interest is of great importance for a report which it is always possible to improve .
the plan was approved by the european council in amsterdam .
this new instrument has already been used and has achieved positive results .
thank you very much , madam commissioner . the debate is closed .
that is why this directive was proposed and that is why we now have a common position .
we support this position .
the rapporteur has done an excellent job .
this was a very important point .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i therefore consider it accepted .
i believe the commission has to address this matter much more seriously .
the debate is closed .
mr president , what i have to say will not take long .
last week we had some time off .
we are now making up for this .
it is good that the sitting will soon be over . the debate is closed .
but the education council could not bring itself to do it .
nevertheless , we must accept the result .
the debate is closed .
but above all we do so because we believe that it is , after all , in the best interest of animals .
i entirely agree with parliament that this is unacceptable .
so that is where we stand today .
thank you , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
we accept what happened yesterday on the floor of the house because it was under the existing rules .
first it was drugs , now asylum policy .
madam president , madam commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i think this is a good example of how the council of ministers and the parliament can work together .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
what has the european union done about water resources ?
i think the commission is clear about that .
i believe it is essential to protect our water , and work in that direction must continue .
we do not have a great deal of experience of this in europe .
however , i congratulate him in any case .
however , water is vital for everyone .
two questions must , however , be asked .
the other question is whether the proposals presented in this report are good .
even for water we have national legislation .
we must really question whether this is the right way forward .
of course we should consider the issue of water here in parliament , because the kind of water we have is vital .
above all it is water quality that can be an eu issue , and where we at eu level should try to achieve something .
of course , not all nations are equal in terms of water resources .
community solidarity should be expressed at this level .
this must be made much more of in our efforts to reach a stage where everything will happen within the framework of a free market .
my question is , how do we consider things ?
what about agricultural reform ?
we cannot therefore support this report now .
we do not doubt the quality of this report .
we know that there is no question of making new eu law in this field .
we can only give our support if this amendment is accepted .
that is unacceptable .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i would like to say thank you for the initiative from the committee .
that is also being considered .
the debate is closed .
finally , despite the problems therefore , i welcome the very positive approach taken by the rapporteur .
with this in view we should welcome the cooperation agreement before us today .
on this basis i support the report and the agreement .
mr commissioner , thank you for your speech .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place in a few minutes .
we can , therefore , support this report .
! !
i therefore give the report my full support .
our colleague 's proposal is a step in the right direction .
but that is another subject .
they soon agreed that this is an issue brussels has nothing to do with .
however , i think this is a matter for the member states .
therefore , i have voted against the report 's proposal ( amendment no 1 ) that there should be a directive in this area .
these are fundamental questions .
is to continue their fight .
however , in principle , the proposal in the report is good , which is why i have voted for it .
the european parliament will soon have an opportunity to decide on the framework directive in the legislative process .
a country 's national resources are and should remain a national concern .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this type of thing cannot continue .
finally , let me say something about relations with the legal authorities of the member states .
i think the past is now the past .
that is the position of most of us .
parliament has an interest to know whether that is going to happen .
is there going to be agreement from the commission for the future ?
does the commission agree with that ?
these reports will not have pleased the commission .
and i am not alone in this .
it is our job to make citizens aware of the many positive aspects of european cooperation , but we must also take existing problems seriously .
there are a number of aspects to this .
mr president , perhaps it is appropriate that i have the last word in this debate before the commission .
this will not be parliament 's last word on this matter .
i would therefore like to mention our conclusions .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , that is all i have to say at this stage of the debate .
that is not so .
we did so to the committee on budgetary control .
it really is time that we had an answer to that .
mr president , i wish to make a very important point .
mr president , the text is in french .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the report before us is once again quite a technical one .
i have already said that i find this completely acceptable .
in this respect , the commission is able to adopt the european parliament 's amendment .
the debate is closed .
he will simply get the answer , " because it is part of the treaty ' .
in any case , we will support this report .
madam commissioner , allow me to ask another question .
the debate is closed .
secondly , there are problems with amendment no 11 .
one of the most important , from my point of view , is amendment no 4 .
but at the moment it is better than the commission proposal .
there cannot be anything more important than this .
while it is technical , it is also very real .
we all do it now and then .
why is this ?
i should therefore like to discuss some of the more general issues involved here .
he has done an excellent job .
in addition , we must ensure that there is coordination between these measures .
in other words , it will go further .
it will not be long .
thank you , madam commissioner .
question time ( commission )
on the basis of these general principles which are common to the three institutions , each one should draw up its own regulations on the specific provisions regarding application .
mr president , i have three short questions .
thank you for this additional question .
i thank the commissioner for his answer .
this is not possible .
is it the commission 's opinion that this should happen ?
so that is what we are going to talk about now .
i think the rapporteur has the right approach .
a lot of progress has been made in recent years , but not enough .
this house made its position on this quite clear at first reading .
i would just like to point out what is involved .
i would call that a major environmental benefit .
we know that .
mr president , thank you and welcome to the commissioner .
however , there are a few things that i want to point out .
it is important if we wish to improve air quality .
we can go further though and this is what our citizens expect .
it is also important for member states to be allowed to take a lead and to have the right to use economic means of control to improve the environment .
in any case , this has already happened , and with good results .
employment is an issue in europe .
it might go the other way .
mr president , we are all concerned about air quality .
that is all i wanted to say .
first of all , i would like to set out the position of the group of the european people 's party .
i would like to make a comment now on competition .
finally , i would like to make a comment to the commission .
we have a new european union health policy , thanks to this parliament .
mr president , i would simply like to say thank you for the debate .
so thank you for the debate .
the debate is closed .
it says very little about it .
it is necessary for the community .
it is only with relevant information that we can make the necessary and right decisions in the environmental sector .
it is very good and i congratulate the commission also on that .
so we are agreed that there will be close cooperation , and we will work towards that .
the debate is closed .
how could this house demand something that did not exist at that time ?
there is something not quite right there !
we are now down to three products .
we do not know what you will accept at this stage .
they concern new issues that we need to vote on , in my opinion .
a start was made many years back .
they will not work .
these proposals would guarantee that .
mr president , i would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this report .
i believe that is what people must take into consideration when they decide on this issue .
it should therefore not be allowed to happen .
in itself , what has been said here may be true , that it does not present any risk to human health .
nevertheless , there is a problem with this .
it is unacceptable .
this amendment cannot therefore be accepted .
thank you , madam commissioner .
you are saying that it is simply not possible .
it is simply not on .
i will not accept it . i have had enough !
i will not stand for it !
it is not on !
we can and will do that .
i know that it is not your decision ; you cannot help it .
what is the right thing to do now ?
the debate is closed .
mr president , the european union 's waste policy is at an earlier stage in its development than european policy on air and water quality .
i do not believe that it does .
the clear answer is no .
they agreed it by a majority .
and now the reality .
how will it all work ?
both have their problems .
he was right to do that .
i also congratulate the commission as well .
i think it is very important that the proposals for amendments concerning the protection of water , approved in the committee on the environment , be carried in tomorrow 's vote .
and we need to take action in this field as soon as possible .
this situation must change .
i hope that she does .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i do not think it is , but that is not my purpose .
we have the right not to vote or vote , as we wish .
i accept my responsibility for the reform .
( applause )
and i have to say that in my group we do not agree with this system of control , which does not guarantee transparency or that parliament will work well .
this house does many things well .
why not ?
( applause )
i return to the business of today - the minutes .
i was not given that opportunity by the president .
the minutes are wrong in both areas .
mr president , i just wish to state that i was here yesterday but did not vote .
that is not good enough .
mr president , on the same point in the minutes .
well , that is the best i have heard yet .
i would like the debate about money to stop , so that we can start with the debate on iraq !
that is what we are here for this morning !
( the minutes were approved )
it has happened several times before .
situation in iraq
mr president , thank you for the opportunity to address parliament on this important issue .
the debate takes place at a crucial moment in the crisis with iraq .
people naturally ask : why is this important ?
the answer i believe is clear .
he did so against his own people .
i very much hope that this resolution will be adopted this week .
there can be no compromise on this .
in our view , information is not enough .
parliament needs the council to find a common position for the european union .
we wish him every success with it .
we should make this responsibility quite clear and stand behind these decisions .
so what should we do ?
europe must play its part in this successful international approach .
there can be no doubt about that .
so far , it has not become clear to me .
this can achieve something .
but only as the position of the country itself .
let us be clear what this crisis is about .
the green amendments to the joint resolution will say all these things .
this is an essential point .
the situation is different today as regards military resources .
why ?
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , in my contribution i would like to say something about the role of the european union and our house in this conflict .
the question is , do we play a part at all , or do we do it justice ?
in our resolution we demand a common position on a common foreign and security policy , but we also say in this resolution how we view this .
we do not want that .
this is simply unacceptable .
it requires international action : that is what we are discussing here .
that is what happened before .
it must not happen again .
we do not know how the next few days are going to turn out .
madam president , i welcome the joint resolution supported by my group which is before the house today .
that also applies to the international community .
the answer is certainly no .
what will happen to iraq 's population ?
madam president , thank you for the opportunity to reply to this very important debate .
therefore , action has to be taken .
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to have your full attention .
i think this is very clear , and everyone should be aware of this .
i will put it to the vote .
it is absolutely necessary that we demand them today ; it is a framework directive .
this is extremely important .
so the nature of the problem did not change .
what is most important is to implement them .
why ?
at the moment we are at second reading and trying to work out an agreement on the common position of the council .
this is one of the areas of environmental policy in which eu decisions could have a major impact .
this is what will improve air quality .
but this difficult situation is not at all due to environmental standards .
this will be the subject of future discussions .
i ask you : what are they up to ?
we always say that we want the best , and most of all we want to protect health .
so i really do not understand the world .
i welcome discussion on this report .
the union and the international community should take them at their word .
if this is achieved , then the european union and the international community will have to draw the appropriate conclusions .
how does the president-in-office of the council think he will do this ?
this , however , has just not happened .
this is my first point .
mr president , this parliament resolution is important .
how has the council put into effect the human rights resolutions which were accepted in the un last year ?
the eu will play a full role across all the work of the commission .
therefore , he will have an opportunity to answer any questions later .
that is not true .
they do not see the government .
there are a lot of others involved as well .
i have not heard you say anything about this , mr commissioner .
this is not the example that has been given by the european union .
but it will not be enough on its own . the european union is and remains a community of values .
we really would like an answer on this issue .
i would like to do one or the other .
i shall now take the various issues which have been raised , and there are quite a large number of them .
that was agreed by the council .
the answer to that is that it should be , and i hope it will be .
that is part of the enlargement dialogue .
if they were not aware of them before , they are certainly aware of them now .
there are a number of policies which are in place .
it is important to have that dialogue .
indeed the commission may be able to provide further information on that .
work is going to continue .
the debate is closed .
i have heard positive comments in this respect .
i hope all will go well .
it is not enough for the commission and the council to tell us how much money they are giving , they must also back the european parliament 's initiatives .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
what is the council 's assessment ?
i would really like to have a very clear answer on this .
even if it does , this is still not enough .
as regards international initiatives , the council will consider with interest any proposals which the commission may make on this subject .
i can say to the honourable member that i do not rule that out .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
i should also like to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
i thank the honourable member for his question .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
that will always be the case .
is that , as ever , possible ?
this specific question was asked and we would like a specific answer .
i would like to ask you to answer these questions , which were before you in good time , in terms as specific as those in which they were asked .
i thank the president-in-office for his reply .
if not , why not ?
if so , then i think this would be excellent .
i understand the point that has been made about developing countries .
i do not think that is in line with what most citizens consider to be our job .
i also have some additional questions : what rules are going to apply ?
who will make the decisions ?
it does not mean it is the end of the matter .
would he like to perhaps give a response on the issue of end use ?
i thank the honourable member for his contribution .
so i hope for a positive response .
the commission has an important role to play in relation to european law in that regard .
subject : consumer protection
progress in these areas will help consumers in all countries .
there is a very positive agenda .
this is a very important principle and i believe it is one that will receive a large area of support from consumers and citizens throughout the whole of the european union .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
thank you mr president-in-office .
i believe a new presidency coming into office - a new government - should at least look at this .
it would then be a matter for the council as to what kind of response would be given .
has there been a discussion about whether the council could take up these issues ?
the council has no further comments to make at this time .
it is not .
they cannot .
well , we shall see if this is actually possible in the long term .
in that respect , i believe that the commission has come to the wrong conclusions .
that , i believe , must change .
we look forward to the commission 's proposals on this .
mr president , i would like to welcome the commissioner and to thank the rapporteur for his report .
firstly , there is the issue of state aid .
but on that , at least , the commission took some action .
mr president , i have one final point .
mr president , commissioner , i too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work .
i would like to point out several aspects i believe to be important .
in effect , the system has had positive results .
we cannot go on like this any longer !
that is certainly true of state aid .
i will certainly act upon it .
the debate is closed .
that is , in our view , an important part of this work .
at least i hope so .
how do we do that ?
that is why we believe this measure is so important .
this is a very important report .
i congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work , and the commission for its excellent proposal .
my concern with the directive proposed is , will it actually improve safety in air transport ?
so i cannot accept any of those amendments .
in conclusion , i would like again to thank parliament for its work .
but that is not the case .
the debate is closed .
they have therefore achieved a lot in the last few years .
i ask that you take this up in the negotiations .
i have been training for that for some time .
the other amendments , however , are not acceptable .
the debate is closed .
madam president , i would just like to say i was present although i am not included in the list at the back .
madam president , this also applies to me .
i am not on the list either .
if there is a procedure for new rules , this house has to agree to them .
but it is not .
it is a new rule , but it is not a change to the agenda .
( applause )
i am quite sure that he will report on the matter .
which are they ?
i therefore believe that this matter is completely clear .
i have not had any response concerning this matter nor have i seen any such list .
however , we have done so .
( the minutes were approved )
the national legislation which will have to be based on this directive must be clear .
many would see the importance of this .
that is why we support the proposals of the commission in principle , as well as the rapporteur 's amendments .
these are not the main problem with regard to people 's health in the european union .
if we do not accept them now we cannot get them back in the second process .
the discussion is closed .
i take note of it and agree with what it has to say .
there are three aspects of interest to agriculture .
the first is environmental .
the conditions are there for doing more than that !
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report .
we have major concerns with regard to the health of consumers and we have major concerns about the impact on the environment .
i look forward to the conflict between these two areas and the competition in the positive sense .
it is we who must decide what it will be like .
money is money after all !
madam president , first of all i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report in a very difficult field .
i am sure that in future there will be much discussion of this subject .
as should be the case with the application of all new research , transparency and consumer information are important .
i therefore welcome this initiative .
i just wanted once more to reply to those who keep saying that it does not help the people in the developing countries .
thank you very much for all your work !
thank you , madam rapporteur .
the discussion is now closed .
i think this problem requires new consideration by all of us .
regulation in this area , therefore , must balance a number of concerns .
it was an amendment which i put down in committee .
welcome
mr president , on a point of order .
after this statement it is clear that our amendments are appropriate .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , that was a very important statement .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
however , it is a step in the right direction and will receive my vote .
however , i am not sure that the question should be decided at the eu level .
the proposal from the committee on the environment should without doubt form the basis for implementation at member state level .
the work carried out by the rapporteur in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection is nevertheless important .
the economic consequences have also been taken into consideration .
the rural area thus , as i see it , has its special place of value in the member states , in the regions .
i come from the rural area .
joint motion for a resolution on iraq
however , such a decision must be taken by the un security council .
france must continue to play its own role , which it does very seriously .
it is time to provide us with the means to do this .
we will therefore vote against the report .
in this report , the rapporteur demands that this practice be supported . we cannot support it .
a stop should be put to this .
mr president , we have already heard a great deal .
they need our solidarity .
we should not allow that !
the joint debate is closed .
in my opinion , this needs to be discussed .
but nothing of the kind has been done .
from all of this , ladies and gentlemen , we can only draw the following conclusions .
however , as you know , the commission has no authority in this matter to implement many of the measures you ask for in your resolution .
you can see right through it .
the others did not even do so .
i hope as they do that this is not the case .
we should just ask ourselves the question : what is the point of all this ?
we should not talk them into it .
this should also apply in my opinion in this case .
i hope that with this resolution we give a clear answer .
you are right .
but we do not want to debate it now , that is not important .
nevertheless the resolution is necessary and it is important that we state our case .
i have my own opinion on the matter .
i would never say that .
but i also have to take into consideration the commission 's institutional position .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed
the next item is the joint debate on the following draft resolutions :
that is why the group of the european people 's party is going to vote against all the resolutions .
that is the commission 's view on this matter .
and when will the commission present this to the council ?
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following draft resolutions :
all that must be made good at once .
instead , what do you do ?
the debate is closed .
for what reason ?
then why this debate ?
tomorrow it will concern other countries .
that was my first point .
i am of the opinion that it is not the president who should make such decisions but this house .
thank you .
independent of this i find it hard to see what sense , for example , points 10 and 11 make in this resolution .
the commission will have to give its word .
of course we are in agreement with the report , which we think is excellent .
it is now 1998 .
the debate is closed .
we therefore agree with the regulation 's objective and with the approach proposed by the commission .
if we try for too much , we will end up with less .
we will follow his lead .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
in fact i had voted against amendment no 12 rather than for it .
mr president , thank you for that opportunity .
( the minutes were approved )
the rapporteur has done his job well .
i have no comment to make in that respect , but i think reports of this kind should not be considered by parliament .
in order to achieve good consumer protection , international rules are required .
system of own resources
this does in fact mean two amendments .
did anything actually happen there , and why are they talking about it ? '
we support that .
we do not take it by any means so seriously .
it is just that they would not be included in these specific procedures .
that is part of amendment no 1 .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i cannot support this report .
shall be shown in the budget ' .
it does not ask for our opinion .
then so be it , we are not going to give it !
there will no doubt be other things said on the subject .
this financial regulation is going to be adopted with or without the european parliament 's opinion .
the court does not think it is community expenditure .
of course , coordination between the community and the member states is necessary .
so i believe parliament cannot accept this role , since it is so significant .
this is certainly not true .
nor are we against the commission 's work .
rather than legal , the problem is therefore a political one .
so i do not understand why the council and our governments do not make more effective use of this instrument .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
however , it is not as good as previous special reports on the very same issue .
i am sure the commission would agree with that .
the commissioner may ask what that has to do with this report ?
it has a lot to do with the report .
that is one of the things about the proposals for reform .
i believe this parliament has a special role in this area , and this is really all parliament can do .
how is this possible ?
i want to make one last point .
how is this possible ?
it is absolutely essential that the commission does something about this fact .
it will not do .
nevertheless , the commission regards them as necessary .
thank you very much , commissioner .
i did vote .
so you have no cause for concern .
so would you like to tell us how you are voting ?
in favour ?
thank you .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the same thing happened this morning .
it would therefore be a good thing to avoid that problem today .
also , the problem of resources must be mentioned .
i know that the commission is not really in favour of such a measure .
why ?
but how can we achieve this ?
so it is a good thing .
only then will these programmes be good .
the green group is therefore going to support this report .
so i think it should not be included as a part of the agreement .
the same applies to this report .
i believe the report on which we are voting today is a significant step forward .
we must work against this .
so i welcome these programmes .
the debate is closed .
that is unfortunately not true .
no .
are there any comments ?
thank you very much .
i would like to express my thanks for these kind words .
i therefore thank you for your efforts in this area !
( the minutes were approved )
it will be done .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the following amendments have been proposed :
( parliament approved the proposal )
( parliament approved the request )
i note that the commissioner for fisheries is here .
i hope she will take note of this , because it is an important point .
this is a very important report and fisheries are extremely important to the regions of this community .
i put the are group 's request to the vote .
that is my first request on behalf of my group .
thank you , mrs green .
mr president , i fully agree that this is an important matter .
all we are trying to do with this question is make it quite clear that parliament is not responsible , and that is why i think it is urgent .
we can deal with this issue in the committee on budgetary control .
( parliament approved the request )
women 's rights
they no longer really exist on a public level .
women no longer even have the right to support themselves .
the same goes for development cooperation .
they must know that they are not alone .
but a democracy cannot exist without respect for human and women 's rights .
unfortunately , no !
we agree to it .
the debate is closed .
in 2002 we will have the euro in the majority of eu states .
there are one or two things where i think we need further time and perhaps further consideration .
this is , after all , only the first reading .
then there is the issue of the second hand market .
we would like our amendments to be taken over .
i have a few more amendments of which i would like to ask the commission , parliament and other groups to have a look at .
that is a step in the right direction , but it is not enough .
but the first case is of course the most difficult .
this clearly is not the case here .
the proposal of the commission is completely unacceptable on this point .
green paper on food law
where consumers are concerned , information is the most important aspect .
the report is also about transparency .
so we need to know the results of this debate and put them into effect .
what criteria do we use , which scientific basis is our point of reference ?
the green paper is not enough .
this is not anything new , but in the area of food law the creation of confidence is vital for people .
that is the way to make progress .
we agree with parliament that we should present a framework directive , but i cannot say when .
the framework directive is part of this process .
things really should not be this way .
i think those are the main points .
and this is precisely what we wish to do !
the debate is closed .
' . and of course , they have not .
they were set up by the european union for a specific purpose .
that is why this report has come about .
here both the commission and the council should take the position of the european parliament very seriously .
but the situation is very different today .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i would like to refer to item 2 of the minutes of yesterday 's sitting , and return to the subject of crime in brussels .
i really think it is high time something was done about this in parliament .
as you know , this matter is not on the agenda .
are there any further comments ?
thank you .
( the minutes were approved )
mr president , on a point of order .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we also have to take national economic policy into account .
all this progress on monetary union is to be supported .
mr president , i would like to draw your attention to one further aspect .
this is not acceptable .
we should therefore take measures with regard to both information and training .
it is true that such instruments have not always been applied to best effect .
first , all those who work within the industry .
the other main british party 's position is no better .
well , here we have an excellent example of this lack of democracy .
it would be good if we in this parliament were to try and find some balance between what we say and what we do .
the question i would like to put , mr commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , is : where will the money come from ?
at present we can do nothing to improve the situation .
i therefore ask what cost ?
two aspects continue to give cause for concern .
this is a really crucial issue .
that is the first and most important step .
i would like to know if this approach would be possible .
that is no longer going to be possible .
what will the impact be ?
why ?
mr president , i asked one question .
mr president , the commissioner mentioned those countries which have already decided on the euro 's national side .
i have taken note of your question .
the joint debate is closed .
their life will never be the same again .
the road safety programme presented by the commission last year is an important first step .
allow me to mention a few .
why has he done that ?
let us see some action .
the technology is there .
i want to mention two other points that we cannot vote for .
consideration should also be given to monitoring .
as i said earlier , you may vote , or you may not vote .
it is quite clear .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
very well , we will take note of that .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i would also like to request the floor regarding amendments nos 11 and 5 .
on amendment no 11
on amendment no 5
madam president , i cannot accept this amendment because it has nothing to do with the euro .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i did not vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i would ask this to be referred to the rules committee .
the line is quite clear that when members do not wish to vote , then they do not have to vote .
they just express the view that they do not wish to vote .
i really could do no more .
'
so what kind of legislation would help in this situation ?
quite simply this does not make any sense .
i just wanted that point to be made .
these proposals are all part of the same report , to which we give our support .
food is an issue of vital importance for the health and safety of consumers and for the quality of life of our citizens .
the main aim should be the protection of the health and safety of consumers .
i give this my full support .
that is unacceptable .
food safety is an extremely important issue .
there is a high risk that our already high unemployment will increase further .
to this i give my full support .
it is not far off .
i cannot go along with that and i am therefore going to vote against the report .
but that is not the case .
we do not think it should be .
it might be sufficient for the president to say who is in favour , who is against .
but that is another matter .
madam president , i agree with you .
so it is good that the commissioner and the commission have brought forward a programme to promote road safety .
everyone says they think it is important , but only a few want to do anything about it in practical terms .
i would hope to see such legislation coming forward from the commission .
unfortunately the commission is not yet in a position to take an initiative on this matter .
we will have to discuss it further .
secondly , mr president , the budget .
mr president , i just wish to point out one or two things .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we welcome that step in the right direction .
i accept that .
i am sure this is an issue we will return to .
the decision we are going to take today is another step in this direction .
that is not good legislation .
this is not necessary .
i welcome that , of course .
the debate is closed .
the role of the european parliament is very important in this .
my group has tabled an amendment , and i hope that all the groups have given it their attention .
our group is therefore in favour of the report .
in the end , it is in fact european structural policy which will be called into question .
madam president , commissioner , i would like to congratulate the committee on external economic relations .
madam president , we too welcome the debate on this report .
again , in principle , i welcome that .
people say this will be the basis of the global economy .
so we want more democracy .
you can have too much of a good thing .
however , i would add a new problem , madam president .
it is taking on a lot .
mr president , it is at this point that i should congratulate the rapporteur , but i shall put off doing so for lack of time .
firstly , there is the problem of democracy and transparency .
how do things stand with this , mr commissioner ?
will it be public or closed ?
i think this is something we must draw attention to .
but that is not all .
it is of great concern .
i cannot tell you whether we will reach a conclusion .
i wish to say a word about that .
i asked a very specific question .
i would like to know about a decision procedure .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
as you well know , i take question time very seriously .
we look forward to developments in the future .
that will be the position of the commission .
will you be making a strong case for community interests ?
are you prepared to put forward proposals in this area in future ?
we have done so in this case .
it is very difficult .
therefore , the only thing to do is to try to be fair and that is what we shall try to do .
we have just discussed this in the previous question , so perhaps not so many comments are needed .
that is the objective .
we hope that this policy too will have a positive effect .
a proposal to this effect is currently being considered at commission level .
that is the question .
i know that the european union cannot clear up all the problems in the community with structural funds money .
i am also all too well aware that a few changes in the regions can also lead to problems .
the defence industry is also ' industry ' , of course .
i will tell you why i am concerned about it .
i have to agree with you .
that is what we have done in this case .
we are unfortunately only at the cooperation stage .
i therefore request that you really do take up this matter , so that we can find a solution to the benefit of all the people in europe .
i am also very pleased that the matter has been raised again .
in view of this situation , commissioner , we support the commission .
as has been said , this really is an extremely important matter .
however , the commission cannot accept this amendment for two reasons .
we share the view expressed by them on this particular point .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is a very important document from the commission .
our third and last comment concerns the budgetary basis for these measures .
i hope they will receive your support .
in this area there is much that the community can offer .
thank you madam president , commissioner and colleagues .
this is not just a market : it is a community .
i hear what the commissioner says .
madam president , i would like to make a few institutional points on the future .
i believe this is essential today .
we need to review this directive .
madam president , four important reports are up for debate .
i think not .
i think it would be better to do this at the national level instead .
madam president , commissioner , allow me to start by making a general comment .
we will be able to come back to these issues soon .
i have two final points .
there should be a clear view on what is important and what is less so .
these , i believe , are important structural matters , all of which are relevant to the question of health policy .
is it to be from one rather than the other ?
we need the research but you must go further , mr commissioner .
thank you madam president .
i shall say more about that in a moment .
let us be clear about that .
you want to see more done .
i would like to go down that road with your support .
you have made it quite clear to me that you expect quite a lot of the commission .
i am going to take note of that .
it does not make sense .
i have to say that this is supported by the commissioner and by the commission .
but , as things stand at the moment , there is nothing .
i will be making that point and it will be for the two institutions to agree as to what we should be doing in the new programme .
i think we have had an excellent debate .
however , if you are in agreement , i have one last speech .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
good morning , mr president .
i know there is a directive on the way and that we are prepared to do something about this , but we must ensure we move the process on .
action is required .
this cannot go on .
( the minutes were approved )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
these could have all been decided here yesterday .
now to the social sector .
we want to make sure that the other countries too can and do implement our social standards and basic social rights .
we stand by it !
mr president , i wish to welcome the president-in-office to parliament .
they know what is going on .
they , even more than us , value democracy and parliamentary democracy in their institutions .
i believe it is necessary to return to the more political aspects .
mr president , we are about to start the negotiations on the accession of the new states to the european union .
the idea of the rule of law will also have to be developed further .
in any case , the european parliament will have a final say on any accession treaty which is agreed by existing member states .
we want parliament to be fully involved and to have an opportunity to express its views .
i want to be specific in relation to three points .
i hope that this approach is acceptable to parliament .
thank you for the opportunity to say a few words .
that goes without saying , mr president .
we can implement different systems , some of which have been mentioned by the president of the council .
i will draw your attention to a system that we are following in the committee on budgets .
yet that is what we had asked for .
we have even made it an accession criteria .
mr president , i would like to make three points .
at the moment the country does not have a president .
of course i would like to reply , but perhaps it would be better if i did so in my response at the end of this debate .
in addition , i have another question to put , mr president of the council .
given their importance , it is vital that we all move together .
this is one of those times .
we believe its content is very important , in particular foreign , security and defence policy .
mr president , i would like to make two points in relation to this debate .
therefore , i hope that we will be able to reach a compromise in this matter .
can i take up one or two points which have been made in the discussion ?
it is important that parliament has that opportunity , to be able to express those views which should be expressed before the council takes a decision on the matters that are before us .
mr president , on a point of order .
this is the last opportunity i therefore have on behalf of the house to ask the presidency to make one final point clear .
i ask him to take one last step towards us .
mr president-in-office , we have that opportunity all the time .
of course they will be taken into account .
why these two groups ?
those were a few comments i wanted to make in response to the questions which were asked .
mr president , by short term we mean those things which can be achieved in 1998 .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
situation in kosovo
the next item is the council statement on the situation in kosovo .
what have we done ?
people ask what the european union 's position is .
let me try to make that clear as well .
this is not the first time we have discussed kosovo .
the european union took little action .
why is it so important for europe to deal with this problem ?
i fully support the measures , commissioner .
if we are serious in this matter , then i believe we will make much more progress .
more pressure will be needed .
as far as that is concerned , iraq has given us some experience .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that is not an acceptable situation .
( applause )
you have given away the case that i have supported all along .
there is more than one form of rules : there are the rules of procedure of the house and there are other rules .
mr president , on a point of order .
it is unacceptable , mr president .
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , on a point of order .
that is where the decision was taken .
this house needs internal reform .
mr president , on a point of order .
there can be no discussion about that .
we think that is appropriate .
but what does it matter ?
this is enough .
i hope they will be taken over by the commission and the council .
we must go further than the council 's and the commission 's position .
it is a question of public safety and respect for the rules of competition .
the question i ask myself , however , is whether it really is best to let the eu act in this area .
i do not think so .
instead , people want the eu to start taking action in areas which concern the consequences of the eu 's policy .
i do not think so .
women 's rights
we are positive about the efforts which the commission has made with regard to increased road safety .
this is a step in the right direction .
i would like to make a second comment .
i fully share the rapporteur 's opinion that something must be done .
we would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work on a very important report .
governments must share this concern with them .
the reports from the commission and the european parliament are both welcome .
environment , health and consumer issues should be given greater priority in political work at european level .
i voted in favour of the report .
our group has tabled an amendment to point 10 of the motion for a resolution .
it was high time they were raised .
but that is not the problem .
i would like to make a number of comments in response to the points which have been raised by colleagues in the discussion .
the question of any military action has not been raised .
were it to be raised it would need to be considered whether or not it was in line with international law and whether or not it would be appropriate and effective action .
there are a lot of questions way down the line on all of those issues .
the debate is closed .
we must ensure that there is transparency of the political process in the far east .
finally , we must look at a reform of the financial institutions .
what initiatives you are taking ?
this is very serious for the whole process .
we must encourage democracy and human rights in all these countries .
i think we could offer more help to their projects .
questions have been tabled by members of this parliament on what has been achieved .
this is another reason why we need political stability as well in both regions .
that is why we see this debate as just beginning .
it is not something that can be left to them .
the joint debate is closed .
international criminal court
we heard from the president of the council yesterday and today on the issue of kosovo .
we must be independent from the security council .
most of the member states of the european union support these basic principles .
what can the council tell us about that ?
what does the council know about this ?
and where will these come from ?
this is why the issue of an international criminal court is so important and so hard to achieve .
for this reason , and on behalf of my parliamentary group , i give my full and total support to this joint motion .
madam president , mr president-in-office , it is not the first time that parliament has expressed its opinion on the international criminal court .
however , there is a considerable measure of agreement on many issues .
that is why there is an urgent need for an independent , international criminal court which can do just that .
the objective of the resolution prepared by the european parliament is precisely to ensure that hope can become reality .
it is now up to the council , the commission and the member states to say what they think .
we need an initiative from all the european institutions .
the joint debate is closed .
but there is more to be done .
of course there are new markets - the markets of the future .
i would like to know if its future is on the agenda for the next industry council .
this talk of a third way must be taken seriously .
here i have some real questions .
i think i speak for all the women on this .
we very much look forward to the report of his group .
obviously it has to be discussed by the council .
we do not yet have the commissioner 's proposals .
could i ask the president-in-office about the question of investment .
mr president , i think there are two very important points here .
i have two short questions .
as you know , there is an initiative at european and american level in this field .
i just do not believe that .
i accept that point entirely .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
you are the president-in-office of the council .
i think that you will understand that i cannot go further than that in my response today .
so , a number of criteria will have to be taken into account .
that is a basis , or more of a basis , for political stability .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , many thanks for your concern and for your answer .
mr president-in-office of the council , thank you for your answer .
it is necessary to meet both criteria .
subject : presidency of the council
there is no " presidency of the union ' .
the council is aware that has been implemented .
subject : support for action against drugs
is that also true of the council ? or is it prepared to act against drugs ?
thank you very much for your reply .
it would be better if the honourable member took that up with them .
i thank the president-in-office for that answer .
the different views of the member states will be put at the council meeting .
this is obviously a matter which members feel is of considerable importance .
but that is not really a matter for the council .
that is a political reality .
one can never talk about the very long term .
i think consumers will very much take that view throughout the union .
first of all , the answer is no .
at the moment this is not on the agenda of the council .
at the moment i have not had that approach .
if i did receive that approach then the matter would be given consideration .
i have not had any approach from the british government on this matter .
that is a different matter .
if it does , i am sure it will approach me to have the matter discussed at the council .
subject : 1999 european parliament elections
i thank the president-in-office for his reply .
i have nothing further to add .
i am not sure whether this is still the case or what the present situation is .
i cannot see this is a matter for the council .
how should we deal with this ?
this was done at the same place , at the same time .
the effects on the labour market remain .
this would be better for the whole of society .
what must we do ?
i would like to discuss three key issues .
how can this happen ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , may i say how pleased i am that this important issue is being discussed .
we are able to plan for this and we should do so .
i thank the rapporteur , as well as the house , for this report .
the debate is closed .
this must change in the short term .
this kind of cooperation is therefore extremely important .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
clearly the european union has already done a great deal in this area .
it takes far too long for member states to do so .
in agriculture we need to step up reform .
the eu must , therefore , continue to support the reform of the economy .
this means that there should be far more cooperation , both between the european union and its member states and between the european union and third countries .
it does not go any further than our present enlargement plan .
at the moment we have no response .
when will we start the negotiations for them ?
do we already have a plan to work with ?
where does the commission stand on this ? what are its views ?
that is what we need .
but this aid should also be provided quickly .
it is simply a situation which we should not accept .
that is the only proper basis for economic reform .
what can , and must , be done to change things quickly ?
i want to tell you what the consequences are .
i cannot allow you any more time , unfortunately .
what can we do ?
soon we will have another of these external policy matters to discuss .
the debate is closed .
consumer protection
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on an important commission proposal .
up until now we have had very few proposals in this area and therefore i particularly welcome this one .
purpose has internal scope .
i believe , as the rapporteur said , that it is important that the directive can come into force quickly .
however , our group does not support the amendments proposed by the group of the european people 's party .
we are therefore going to support the rapporteur 's report .
although this is a matter of community law , it is not being applied by the member states .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i raised two points .
( the minutes were approved )
firstly , we must take the budget into consideration .
what does the council propose ?
once again , young people are not a priority for everyone .
however , we have to be clear about one thing .
this is not yet the case .
why is this the case ?
but what is being done ?
we must make this a reality .
and that is what we want to see .
the money has to be there .
let us have proper funding .
it was not the council and it was not the commission .
of course , the right conditions for this have still not been created , even now .
if it does not , we cannot expect many young people to become involved in this service .
thank you once more for your support .
i think that there are many young people within the community who would in fact welcome that opportunity .
the debate is closed .
therefore , the commission 's step has been a positive one , but it is not enough .
i therefore believe we in parliament will have to take a clear stand on this .
finally , i would like to make one more point .
unfortunately , the commission cannot accept the rapporteur 's amendments .
the debate is closed .
what can be done ?
it has been very successful .
it is something which is very possible .
the citizens demand that priority should be given to eu cooperation in this area .
i share that view .
together we must create a high level of protection in the member states .
there is reason to look at certain rules of procedure in the same way .
i welcome this idea .
but at this time it is difficult for the debate to continue .
this has happened many times before .
it is not the first time .
it should not happen again !
this will just not do !
this is at the beginning of the debate on an issue .
we have heard the commission 's opinion .
( applause )
it will have to be taken tomorrow morning .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , i put in a request to the previous president .
i have no problem in following it as well .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is too little .
this is important for many reasons .
motion for a resolution on kosovo
motion for a resolution on the international criminal court
we believe the commission 's report points to some very important problems .
we are pleased the problem has been put on the agenda .
in these circumstances , the union for europe group cannot support the joint motion for a resolution , nor the resolutions tabled by the various groups .
we have so many times heard that something is going to happen and nothing has happened .
the joint debate is closed .
the joint debate is closed .
i do not know all the individual results but i do not think there are any significant changes .
the strategy of the government is completely unacceptable .
this has come up over and over again and it is about time action was taken .
the situation is more than serious .
so they benefit .
a solution must be found .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we in europe should aid that .
that is right .
we hope the eu will take up a strong and clear position in this respect .
the debate is closed .
this is not the procedure we are following .
where are we at now ?
it is all that remains , in any case .
so this is where we are at the moment .
they must understand that we are not going along with that .
really no problem at all .
and what has the commission done ?
it must take some action .
i would also like to address the french members .
what is the future , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen ?
i take note of what the commissioner said about the french authorities following the same procedures as in the past .
i think it is time some common sense was brought into this whole process .
mr president , i should like first of all to thank the commissioner for the efforts he has made .
we cannot allow these people to get away with it .
nothing was done .
this is very serious .
as other members have said , it is up to the commission to take strong action .
this is my position and i stand by it .
when i say " we ' , i mean the commission in particular .
this is the reality of the situation .
this is the reality , can you believe it ?
this is the real situation .
on the other hand , i request your support in this matter .
( applause ) i am taking note of this .
this really is not our role .
this is the current situation .
the debate is closed .
madam president , i hope it is a point of order .
madam president , i wish to make a point of order .
the house voted for this .
so much for procedures .
there is a second reason for this .
i have now reached my third point .
there are four points that i consider to be essential .
i will not come back to it .
i just wish to add one point .
i hope also that the commission will take it seriously for the current period .
it is and should remain a national concern for a long time to come .
as far as the green group is concerned , such a general request is unacceptable .
that is the majority view of the green group .
we need progress .
common legal standards are not enough .
this report rightly points to this .
the debate is closed .
we are well on our way .
we wish that more of our colleagues could experience it at first hand .
i would like to add two comments to this .
i would like to take up the basic issues in this report and in your discussion .
this demand must rightly be considered and supported .
let us also consider members of parliament at a regional level .
following your request , the commission has decided to set up a joint service for the implementation of aid to the third world .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
are there any other comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
and i am very pleased to see that there are nevertheless a large number of us here to vote on this report , which is indeed very important .
on amendment no 2
i give you my word that we will ensure that it does not happen again .
mr president , on a point of order .
every report so far has been of high quality .
i am in favour of the proposed guidelines .
in view of the above , we have therefore voted against the report .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we are therefore in favour of the proposal .
that is something this house should be very concerned about .
in fact , the regulation demands that , following one of these reports , member states should report back on what they have done to take matters forward .
there is no account of any member state having come back to report after the previous report .
we should talk about them .
we must then have reports on the monitoring of the common fisheries policy .
this is a major problem .
it is quite clear that there is a lack of political will there , and something has to be done about it .
that is what we are discussing today .
this will not be possible , and it is a point which we would like to make very clear .
i certainly agree .
the other is economic .
first of all , i would like to make two points .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i have a number of comments in view of this .
there are various reasons for this .
good morning , madam president .
that is one of the fundamental problems .
mr president , it goes without saying that all member states should keep to the rules which form part of the common fisheries policy .
on that point i agree with the rapporteur .
i have tabled two amendments to this effect , and i hope the rapporteur will agree with these .
because they , the member states , are responsible .
it was a good discussion , and i look forward to working together more .
this has been a great problem .
the debate is closed .
on paragraph 3 :
( parliament adopted the resolution )
there is also the activities of third countries .
this is what this report is about .
but , as a parliament , must adopt this as our general principle for the future .
i can say the same about amendments nos 3 and 5 .
we are aware of the situation and of the european parliament 's position on the commission 's proposal .
the debate is closed .
on amendment no 1 :
that is what we shall do .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i would like to thank the rapporteur for doing such a good job on this report .
the committee on culture proposed an increase to five years .
as you can see , ladies and gentlemen , that is a very small number .
mr president , i also wish to congratulate the rapporteur , because in her report she has come up with a solution to a problem which the commission has made for itself .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , on a point of order .
but they are just as important as any other discussion .
that is also unacceptable .
mr president , i would like to bring your attention to another problem on a point of order .
statement by the president
are there any comments ?
we happen to have the commissioner for transport here .
as far as we are aware , this has never happened .
has this since happened ?
madam president , on a point of order .
i hope you will call upon the council to give me an answer .
i hope that is also possible in this case .
( the minutes were approved )
if this is not the case , it will , of course be put to the vote in parliament .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
madam president , i am not sure whether we are talking about one report or both reports .
it was a joint debate .
he still does not have the council 's opinion on this .
it is not possible .
and if not , why not ?
that is going to take place this week .
we have no reason to keep it on or take it off .
there was a strong request from the group of the european people 's party last week that it should come off .
( the order of business was adopted )
they are currently only in french .
that is the problem .
i fully understand .
that will bring a real benefit .
i have been given three minutes .
i am very concerned because you have only two minutes .
that is not the case , however .
my second point .
now , i do not really support that .
i can see what would happen .
the debate is closed .
this idea is basic in my proposals .
as a result the report is now in a form that i consider unacceptable .
his solution , as presented to the committee , was a good one .
there are a number of main issues which i would comment on .
this is a development which is just going to continue .
there are a lot of things in this report which i think are very urgent .
we have still to agree on the content of these rules and on their application .
transparency cannot work in one direction only .
i have to say that i cannot see the point of that .
that is why i hope this amendment will be accepted after all .
i would give the commissioner the following example .
it takes me two days to get to this parliament .
i do have a problem with the way the commission has developed these principles .
mr president , i should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work which , i know , has been quite difficult and technical .
the debate is closed .
in this case it is .
nevertheless , we support the proposal before this house and , of course , we congratulate the rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
what is it about ?
however , there are two problems with this .
now to my conclusions .
i would not have had that ' if necessary ' .
mr president , what is going on ?
or how do you see things , ladies and gentlemen ?
it would have been good if we had been given the opportunity to discuss these issues in one context .
i have six short questions to put to the commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i will come to that now .
amendments nos 1 and 2 .
mr president , finally i have two further comments .
however , i still think that the council will again not adopt these amendments .
let me offer my own region as an example .
it is not as if we were discussing this issue for the first time .
i wish to deal with them .
four proposals should be mentioned here .
but i have to say that the court is important in this regard .
we are making some progress in some of them .
that is why i say : think about it again and see if you can come up with a better answer tomorrow before the vote .
that is not really progress .
first of all , the commissioner and the commission support your point of view .
secondly , we are going to make a proposal .
so this is not the place to do it .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
but the brussels ' authorities are not the committee on the rules of procedure .
( the minutes were approved )
the same opinion was expressed yesterday by members from other countries .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
however , at least we received them .
we need to get a solution to this and it will only be done if we get all the institutions together talking about this .
we expect reports on that .
i have two final points on this report .
this does not mean , however , that there are no problems .
i must say that there are some problems here .
another matter that i would like to bring up concerns the guarantee fund .
this concerns the european investment fund .
this we do not like .
i therefore refer in particular to the conclusions , where action is also called for .
the enlargement process will make this even more important .
the commission is taking measures , but more needs to be done .
i know from the discussions in the committee on budgetary control that parliament is particularly concerned by lack of progress in certain areas .
the commission has taken note of the report in question .
we hope that the project will be able to work with five member states before the end of 1999 , but there have been many difficulties , as you know .
the commission will , of course , respect the content of these resolutions .
many of the new issues involved may well have been present a year ago in a different form .
this is a major problem .
we want this change - and here i am speaking both to the council and to the commission .
this is the key point .
how often have we discussed this subject ?
i shall say one more thing and this will be my final word on the subject .
this is good for public opinion , and it might also be good for the commission itself .
what is the current system ?
different countries have different systems .
should something not be done about it ?
they are not better people , after all .
parliament will then be in a position to deal with you in quite a different way .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i too support and agree with what has been said so far .
it is not in the budget .
it is under the control of the member states .
let it remain there .
it is important that we have a working document to work on in future when it comes to budgetary matters .
i would like to thank you overall .
there has , indeed , been progress .
i would like to focus on another point , mr president .
the commission is only responsible for monitoring this control process .
we look forward to it .
what does that mean ?
mr president , thank you very much for this debate .
secondly , financial regulations were not accepted as a principle .
that will be done .
the new regulations are very clear .
the debate is closed .
what can be done ?
mr president , i should also like to draw your attention to another matter .
i am speaking on a point of order .
i hope that you will give this matter your attention .
i believe that we reached agreement on this matter in the discussions held by the committee on budgetary control .
there is no lack of proposals !
it is an important area . thank you for the report .
for this reason we cannot accept any report which would lead us in this direction .
this is the third time that this has happened .
you will receive a communication on this subject very soon .
madam commissioner , thank you for your speech and for speaking in a difficult situation .
the debate is closed .
i hope the rapporteur will support those amendments at that time .
the rapporteur is fully aware of that .
i am quite prepared to give my support to the other two , and will make a proposal before the end of the year .
i would like to discuss this with you and the council in the committee on employment and social affairs .
( the matter was referred back to the committee responsible )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that has been the subject of debate in our political groups .
ladies and gentlemen , we have just discussed this problem a short while ago .
then we shall make a decision .
is that right ?
i did not make myself clear .
i would like to make that absolutely clear .
we are in agreement on that .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
like many of our colleagues , i wish to support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .
the system also has to be approved by the commission .
there was then a need for a new regulation .
i therefore believe that the decision we have taken is the right one .
it is for these reasons that i support this report .
i think this matter should be outside the scope of this parliament .
there are only four member states where such initiatives exist in practice , and in those countries they are working well .
now the commission has tabled a legislative proposal .
these have indeed been taken into account in the commission 's proposal .
i hope the commission will pay attention to this right from the start .
mr president , i welcome the commissioner to the house .
finally , i do not think it is appropriate that the third sector should be included .
i would like to know from the commission what its position is on these amendments .
but i think we should both use reason , and , together , take a serious look at each others amendments .
that is why i hope that we will be able to look at this programme in a positive way .
these companies i am talking about are often very small .
i hope so .
mr president , first of all i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report .
i would also like to make clear from the start that i am in favour of the growth and employment initiative .
these people are simply not on the market at the moment .
we need further training .
it is not the responsibility of the commission or indeed member state governments to create employment .
that is my response to your comments on the first initiative .
having said that , it is not enough simply to provide them today with what they need most .
i do not think that the growth and employment initiative is , on its own , enough .
the debate is closed .
it will then be time for people to show what they have done to live up to what they have agreed .
measures must therefore be taken within the framework of the european social fund .
mr president , what we have here is a good statement from the european commission .
but mr president , that is about it .
that is also her right .
mr president , if you understand this , than i must congratulate you .
it is not possible to do two things at once .
and that is a very major problem with this report .
we have time and again called for this within the group .
that is important for the union and it is also just as important in the global economy of the future .
the debate is closed .
it is absolutely clear that the second approach is the one we should follow .
in our amendments , we ask to be involved in this procedure .
i believe this is important , and i hope that the commission will support our proposals .
i agree with all her proposals and conclusions .
i believe it is necessary to make such a point .
however , my main point is that this is an excellent report which i hope will be approved by a large majority tomorrow .
that can and will happen .
i believe the structural funds have a very different objective to state aid and i would simply refer to the case of rural areas .
the problem is a real one .
i do not know if i have given an answer to what has been said .
mr president , on a point of order .
i did not ask about the policy .
as i have already said , the commission has already taken a decision as far as regional aid is concerned because it is the commission 's responsibility .
it is up to you .
the debate is closed .
this is extremely positive .
it is the way forward .
but if we can agree on regional aid , we should decide whether to change the extent of such aid .
the third point is that we are concerned about how monitoring should be carried out .
the eu countries have much scope for research .
and why ?
but what happened ?
we should consider this here to ensure that the work of parliament is actually appropriate at all times .
but that is not all .
will there be consequences or not ?
however that is at present not the case .
and there is a final problem : regional aid .
question time ( commission )
mr president , on a point of order .
it is on the same issue .
i know we have had problems , and we have had changes .
if they do not have that effect , we will change them again .
i completely agree .
i want to thank the commissioner for his response .
thank you very much , commissioner .
i shall make the same reply as before : this matter is still being discussed .
1 )
subject : consumers and the euro
if so , how will this principle be implemented ?
in the light of the various problems , we shall then consider what to do .
subject : transport of animals
i would like to put one further point to her .
if this process does not work there from the start , then it may well not work for us either .
i must be very clear .
i hope that is clear .
that seems to me what actually happened .
is that true ?
this is the result of what i am saying .
our request is that they reduce their activities .
is that clear now ?
so we are talking about a global implementation report .
thank you for the information .
we cannot take a decision until we have all the information available as to implementation .
if not , why not ?
they continue to act as independent companies .
if the matter changes , perhaps you might wish to come back to the question at a later date .
i should just like to put two short questions to you .
perhaps he could answer that particular point .
i would ask you if you could look into the procedure by which the questions are put into the order they are on the order paper .
thank you very much indeed .
i think the commission 's proposal is very good .
i have difficulties with some of the amendments tabled .
we regard that as very important , and i hope that tomorrow there will be a majority in this house for it .
we cannot allow that .
i am also aware that we in europe are working hard to achieve this .
i am in agreement with the commission on many points .
that is an extremely important aspect of state aid .
we would , however , like to make two comments in this respect .
we feel that the commission has an important role to play in this respect .
the relevant market is the global market .
it will not be of any help to the sector itself .
so , what has happened to make us change our strategy ?
is that the international change which has taken place ?
for once , we all together were able to say no .
but today , who could say as much ?
sometimes even more than one third of the aid was provided .
that was the situation .
so in effect , the question has now been with us for many years : can we continue like this ?
do you wish to keep this policy or not ?
who can believe for a moment that the commission is not in fact concerned about this ?
before , in practice , we could not .
but now this will no longer be possible .
that was one point i wanted to make .
the debate is closed .
i welcome the commission 's proposals .
i am pleased to be able to say that .
i think it is a good response to a good commission proposal .
i ask the house to support it .
we do not want to be put off any longer .
these are important amendments which everyone in this parliament should support .
there are many people who will benefit from that amendment .
however , we should have a debate where it makes sense to do so ; namely , in a technical committee .
that is also the reason why the group of the european people 's party will tomorrow propose that it should be referred back to the relevant committee .
but it is not only they who often have problems with the use of public transport .
to that extent , i support the social aim of the directive .
we have in fact done so .
i should like however to note that we have already come a long way and what is more , after a very long time .
that has also been said .
that is our position .
i know that it does not meet all the requirements which have been expressed here .
the debate is closed .
we know that all this is not a true reform of the system .
the amendments proposed by the rapporteur all go in this direction , and i support them .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
these are not new rules .
i have not taken anything off the agenda because i cannot do so .
finally , the issue here is communication .
just like any other member of this house , you should know them , and the rules of procedure too .
this is not my problem .
we shall see , that is all .
that is all .
i would like to make one comment on what you have said .
i did take these into account .
i would like to request two things , mr president .
i am not going to give more time to it .
( the minutes were approved )
it is not a question of human rights .
mr president , i am very pleased to be here today to report on behalf of the presidency on progress in international development policy .
on both issues , both of which are absolutely key to progress in development , there is good policy and the problem is implementation .
we propose that we should .
we are in favour of this new idea .
this is the fundamental point .
a number of areas have to be considered .
mrs short , this is a major task for you .
it is a question of developing new instruments .
there is more in it than in the green paper .
that should also be put into effect .
from now on it will be up to them .
what does the honourable member want ?
this should be our aim .
at last we have a debate about development cooperation , and we all know that does not happen often .
so for us this is a special concern .
that is its proper place .
this is my final point .
mr president , could i welcome the president-in-office here ?
there is much that is positive in this cooperation , but there is also much which does not work .
keep at it !
i do not have a lot of time , but i would like to make a few points .
but this never actually happened .
mr president , what should happen now ?
the question is whether five years is not far too short .
but i think we should make much more of it .
that is all i wanted to say for the moment .
mr president , i would like to say that i think this is an excellent report .
i think this is the only sustainable solution in the long term .
we must have the same standards for trade and agricultural policy as we have for aid policy in general .
that is absolutely right .
we must make sure it is implemented .
we need to put that in place .
there is strong agreement in the commission and the council that is the way in which our efforts need to move .
that is agreed .
members know the procedure .
i have to move on .
russia has a key role in eu foreign relations .
we must all be clear about that , and therefore we must think more about our security .
obviously we do not want a war or conflict with russia , but we must see the situation quite clearly .
mr president , the report on future relations with russia is an important one .
these principles are conditions for the creation of a greater europe , in which peace , freedom , the rule of law and democracy rule .
the european union must take note of these questions .
what does this actually mean , though ?
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken at voting time .
( applause )
like you , i am extremely pleased that this resolution has been so successful .
madam president , on a point of order .
thank you for your cooperation .
i would like to have that information .
it is indeed a problem .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
why ?
that is extremely important .
( applause )
i put it to you , the committee had every opportunity to debate this report .
i accept that there are a lot of amendments but many of these are absolutely necessary .
we have an important job to do here ; let us get on with it .
i would like to know why he did not accept that responsibility .
it was then shown that there were difficulties in doing this .
i proposed this before the vote in the committee .
that is why they do not want the legislation on the floor of this house .
( the matter was referred back to the committee responsible )
we all know that right now in our member states important questions are being asked about the start of monetary union .
we are being heard .
therefore we have to make sure that we do it right .
so we need to put in place systems that will guarantee that public confidence .
mr president , i ask you to ensure that it does .
these are the two proposals that i would like you to consider , and i hope that you will vote in favour of them tomorrow .
we have come a long way since then .
why have a monetary europe ?
why have an independent central bank ?
for monetary stability ?
this is unfortunately not the case with the european central bank .
the answer is certainly not .
if this is its position , its monetary policy will be supported .
indeed , this is common sense .
it is the same throughout europe .
mr president , the european central bank , which will be set up in three months time , will be more independent than any existing bank in the world .
price stability at any price , even at the price of increasing unemployment !
economic and monetary union will give us that right .
what will the consequences of this be on the member states ' policies ?
let me give you an example .
and in order for the euro to be a success , we are all agreed that we need to guarantee price stability .
ladies and gentlemen , the euro has to create stability for member states .
that will not happen in the future .
if this were so , there would be no reason to follow a monetary policy of price stability .
mr president , this report is fundamental to the future of the european parliament .
i do not believe in the idea of a european economic government , because we have european institutions .
we must not ask the central bank to do any more than it was created to do .
it is a question of public confidence .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , progress on european enlargement has been one of the key priorities of the presidency .
i would like to deal with them one by one .
firstly , the european conference .
discussions will focus on drugs and crime , the environment , foreign and security policy , regional cooperation and economic matters .
mr president-in-office , i thank you for your report .
i believe that it was a good start !
we expect and demand no less of our future partners .
the work can start now .
i therefore welcome the commission 's new statement on this .
what policy has the council in mind , mr president-in-office ?
we should keep this very clearly in mind .
most of us in the parliament support enlargement .
the more difficult question is how much we are prepared to pay to achieve it .
finally , mr president , i have a comment about turkey .
i believe that this is an important issue .
on the agenda were environmental issues and matters to do with regional cooperation .
people will only accept a greater europe if it results in more , not less security .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we therefore support the proposals of the commission in principle but they do not go far enough .
we in the european parliament are no longer prepared to accept such a situation .
a new start is necessary .
if you do not see it as possible at this moment , what procedure do you have in mind ?
make use of this meeting to consider this question seriously .
projects over ecu 2 million currently have to be approved by the member states ' committee .
the council took the decision for very practical reasons : the situation was urgent .
that , indeed , is what the whole aid programme is about .
we need not talk too much about the past .
i have to have an agreement with him on this .
thank you very much , commissioner .
question time ( council )
i shall not allow any more points of order .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
up until now we have not heard anything from the french .
it is for each state to give its views on that matter and you should address your questions to them .
that report was adopted by this parliament .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
it is for individual member states to decide whether any further action is required to deal with particular social or economic consequences .
they have had a considerable period of time in which to make an assessment .
i can add no more at the present time .
it should be fact .
that was the position at that time .
there has been that opportunity in the past .
i cannot say more than that at this point .
it should therefore be possible to provide this .
therefore i cannot really help the honourable member .
growth across the union is in the interests of citizens of all our countries .
i wish to congratulate the president-in-office on his last answer .
that will be a further opportunity to discuss many of those issues .
i hope that the bank would adopt that policy .
i thank the president-in-office for his reply .
mr president , this is of interest both to the countries within the single currency and to those which remain outside .
this must stop !
that is due , not least , to the initiative of this parliament .
i think we are very close on this issue .
we think that is good .
what is the issue here ?
i believe there is hope for the future .
i just wanted to let you know this .
that is how it has been set .
that is all we are really .
the debate is closed .
i would like to look at several of them .
i am speaking in his place .
we always say that the commission must make a proposal to us , the commission has the right to make proposals .
that would be my request to the commission .
it is expressed in the decision .
madam president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and to thank him for the work he has put in on it .
on the motion for a resolution itself i would like to make a few specific points .
that is our aim .
that is the point you make .
this effort needs to be taken not only at community level but also at national and local levels if it is to be really effective .
the debate is closed .
we also agree with the amendments tabled by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
much important work has been carried out by the council of europe .
but there are two things i would like to draw your attention to .
this is a step back .
it is an excellent report .
i would like to go through them very quickly .
amendment no 3 .
as i said earlier , we have already done this .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following three reports :
it remains to be seen whether the council will accept this .
there is much for us to do there , too .
one more thing must be clear to us in this context .
regarding energy policy , there is an urgent need to act at european level .
the ' employment and growth initiative ' is a joint success of the european parliament and the council .
it seems that everything is going so well and that is good .
during the life of this parliament we have seen significant progress .
it concerns the treaty of amsterdam .
these are the reasons why we will vote for the report provided the proposal of the committee on regional policy is approved .
one of the main priorities mentioned by the rapporteur is that the budget must continue to be a budget for employment .
as for the 1999 budget , i would like to make five points .
we need a solution to this problem in principle .
i shall come back to this point again at the end .
but now to the content of the guidelines before us .
that is not what we voted for .
what we have here is a very clear view of principle .
it would be a great service to parliamentary democracy .
this is not so .
what are these guidelines ?
i am sure the commissioner is aware of these .
the second issue is transparency .
we are making progress here .
that process will continue this year .
it certainly has .
the debate is closed .
however , i would like to draw your attention to one more thing .
are there any comments ?
that is what i would like .
i would like to say that the debate will take place , although there will be no vote .
( the minutes were approved )
but he is not here either , so i would therefore ask you to open the debate .
you could not in fact make a better job of it .
we just have a debate , or we do not .
when i am out and about talking to people , they often ask me why so few members of parliament vote .
it is a report , of course , on the previous year .
so i welcome this change to the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
what is it about ?
it is a short report but also a significant one .
now , with this rule change , it is quite clear that the full members will have to be members of the main committee .
the debate is closed .
it is now time to put this on the agenda .
the situation in the public sector is another matter , because freedom of movement is far less well developed .
mr president , first of all , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
" the citizens of the union ' , everyone says .
he is only allowed to do so in germany .
of course , there are problems .
there are problems , for example , with workers ' access to employment .
i do not know what the solution to this problem is either .
the problem , however , is not whether there is community legislation on all these issues .
i think there are many eu citizens who would not agree , and who time and time again have problems themselves or meet people who have .
this is a different approach , but i believe it has a great deal to offer .
this situation is quite simply unacceptable .
we would hope that common sense could be applied in all european policies , especially the single currency .
should they expect more ?
' so what ? ' you might think .
i could tell you of many problems which i still experience .
i could go on and on .
we brought them here to work for us .
these people have a great many problems .
the other two must go back .
it is in line with the text of the treaty in force and i am therefore in favour of it .
mr president , i agree with many of the points raised so far , so allow me to look at two more general points which i believe are relevant .
i believe we should support these in this parliament .
people can live and work in different countries and decide in which country they want to live , in the long or short term .
but they do not want to do so for tax reasons .
there is still a lot to be done when it comes to freedom of movement and freedom itself .
that is not the kind of thing we want here .
i think today 's debate is precisely about all these problems .
i believe they expect things of us .
action is also being taken to improve dialogue with the citizens .
the debate is closed .
enlargement and cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs
welcome
( parliament adopted the decision )
that is my request .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , we have now taken a vote on this report .
my other reason for voting against this amendment is that i have finally been able to find out what it is about .
they did not work .
i think that was the case .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
mr president , on a point of order .
before the vote on amendment no 5
' .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the second problem concerns the implementation of the single currency .
there is no response to this question in the report .
that is why i believe the council should review its position .
i have therefore voted against this report .
we have done so for a number of reasons .
we cannot see any reason why the eu should deal with this area as well .
it was not , and is not , under discussion .
if that is made clear , i think we may be content with the report .
it is an extremely important one .
that is why this report is an important one .
however , the reality is far from this .
in our opinion , the european union also has an important role to play here .
the debate is closed .
that is our problem .
we should draw conclusions for our policy as a whole .
we have a very great task here , which we must finally face up to .
we do indeed have a great task here .
we have a common task of basic solidarity .
mr president , a great deal has already been said .
in any case , in my current role of responsibility , i note your comments and will forward them to the people concerned .
before the vote on paragraph 5
it concerns paragraph 5 .
this is a difficult situation for me .
that was the problem .
then we shall see who has a majority .
i have a number of members who want to make points of order .
then people said : ' we shall reach agreement . '
he says he has now found this word , which is the right one .
there is no question about that .
i will hear what they have to say before taking any decisions .
it is he who was to have given us the information .
it has several .
( applause )
so we must move on to the next item , but we must do so according to the rules of procedure .
after the vote on paragraph 5
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the european parliament should also play a key role here .
it is for these reasons of principle that i voted against this report .
for this reason , we have voted against the report .
why ?
but that did not happen .
however , we wish to make a few points .
we have voted in favour of the report in question .
we need more research , more public information .
the first is the question of enlargement .
however , we must of course help them .
then we shall be making progress !
then there will be further changes , as soon as the enlargement of the european union has actually taken place .
i believe that is also one of the key points of the report .
the report does not include a single word about this .
that is no policy to bring about an area of freedom and the rule of law .
a lot of technical assistance is required .
let me now turn to monitoring and assistance .
the procedure is based on a report from the commission , and it will be made for the first time at the end of this year . justice and home affairs will be very important in this review report .
the debate is closed .
let that be made clear .
i shall now say why .
nevertheless , i will give you the floor for a point of order , if that is the reason for your request .
i will , however , allow you to make a point of order .
( applause from the group of the european people 's party )
i would just like to say one thing about not reading reports .
that is a question which must be put to us , the european parliament , first !
we are all pleased that we shall soon have monetary union in the european union .
( applause )
we therefore agree with the report in full .
this is an important principle .
the same applies to the question of data protection and the role of the european court of justice .
i particularly welcome the provisions on set times for action .
the debate is closed .
i therefore ask parliament to support the council in this initiative .
however , europe as a whole is subject to the rule of law and we can also put our confidence in it in this area .
the debate is closed .
the answer is short . the answer is " no ' .
i think that is a point that has to be made at the very start .
i understand the reasons that you have given .
can i say that i do not believe any of them ?
that is why we need an independent assessment .
so , too , the commission has a case to answer .
we are behind the council and the commission .
this we support ; no more , but also no less .
and what will be achieved ?
we received this commitment from the commission several years ago .
i want to ask you what these young people will do .
however , we are not in that position .
the question is , how do we deal with it ?
we do not have any other jobs .
you can see that the problem is not local .
so that is the problem we face .
i feel it is important for you to know that .
that is simply not the case .
the commission is not making any particular proposal .
what is the reason for that ?
a lack of tax coordination .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
that is what was agreed yesterday .
mr president , i would just like to point something out .
thank you very much .
i have made a note of it .
several of us were here yesterday .
thank you , mr president .
( the minutes were approved )
what progress has the president made with this request ?
we will look into it , however .
but i may be wrong .
mr president , i would like to make two comments .
that is the first point .
that is why our group decided to vote as you proposed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament approved the proposal )
we support better , more effective , practical cooperation between member states .
i cannot accept this .
this is not just true of air transport .
of course , the budgetary aspect still has to be considered .
a european contribution here is essential for a number of reasons .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
there was excellent cooperation between him as the rapporteur for this report and myself as the rapporteur for the 1998 budget .
we know about these problems .
we discussed them just this week .
we have created a special budget line in the budget procedure .
we want more transparency here .
i thank him for the report .
this is an excellent idea .
the decision was the right one .
nuclear power is not one of them !
i have been to that country , and it says on the one hand that it does not wish to be independent from russia .
i think the european parliament must make sure the agreement is put into practice as quickly as possible .
the report is excellent , and i support it .
every effort has to be made to ensure that the proposals in this report are implemented .
the debate is closed .
i would then support it .
ladies and gentlemen , we have heard the rapporteur 's opinion .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the agreement itself is no more than a statement of political commitment .
that has a very great effect on our interests .
if we did , we would be much better off !
mr president , many companies today are in business all over the world .
there are many legal systems which allow this , including that of the european community .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i hope you will soon be able to report something positive to the house .
in any case , this could open a debate .
ladies and gentlemen , i would ask you not to open a debate .
parliament has come to the end of the agenda .
are there any comments ?
welcome
i know we will continue to work together in the future .
thank you one and all for your support .
i am sure this will be supported by the european parliament .
so do i .
( applause )
but we are .
how was it done ?
we cannot draw any other conclusion .
there is still a long way to go .
we should not believe that this agreement will be accepted by everyone .
and why can these people not speak ?
i have not time today to talk about some of the people but let me give you one example .
we should be aware of that .
i know that the union will continue to support the process and it is absolutely essential .
( applause )
thank you very much .
the debate is closed .
thanks to a new rule , the group will also be able to agree on its own internal regulations next may .
that seems clear to me .
we have heard about access but access is not what parliament wanted ; we want to request the committee to give a direct opinion to parliament on specific issues .
will the members have that direct access to the committee to give an opinion on any specific issue , not through the commission ?
thank you .
i do not share the member 's concerns at all .
so we must not demand more from this group than from those at a national level .
that much is clear from the work they have done .
i believe that this group is doing its work .
thank you , mr president .
this was important for our assessment .
however given a single monetary policy , it will be all the more important to increase cooperation in economic policy .
( applause )
mr president , i should firstly like to thank the rapporteur for his report and for the work he has done in committee .
this is a very important time for the european parliament .
that would be unacceptable .
the treaty is clear .
there are , however , problems with the report .
we wish to stress that we need dialogue on these both , and the european parliament has a very important role to play here .
but it seems essential to us that the democratic control of the european central bank should remain a matter for the european parliament .
today we have achieved the single currency . this is a lot , a great deal , but it is not everything .
it is a step which is being taken without the support of the citizens .
what will happen with the enlargement towards the east ?
i doubt that people will accept such a policy .
there is then , of course , the role of our parliament .
as regards the present vote , i want to stress the following aspects .
in fact , 11 countries are going to be in at the start .
everything now points to this being a successful project .
so far , the people have not seen these results .
i think this has finally been achieved .
the single currency of democratic countries will make demands on democracy .
nevertheless , the less said for the moment regarding the problem of the european central bank , the better .
the debate is closed .
the first of these is growth .
growth is a basis - not the only one - for progress , and also for employment .
the second aspect i want to mention concerns employment .
the first question is in relation to investment .
we want a monetary policy that will help to promote employment and growth within the european union .
the commission have mentioned this in their text in a very clear way and we want to make sure that the monetary authorities in europe , particularly the european central bank , address this point too .
it is not a question of international trade , it is a question of internal demand .
that is not the way we see it .
mr president , this is a question not only of economic growth , but of economic growth which makes sense .
a great deal .
without this a great deal can go wrong .
if this is to become successful it must have political support .
mr president , even before it has come into force , monetary union is a success .
i would also like to thank the commission and to say how pleased i am with the development of our institutions , the council , the commission and parliament , in this field .
firstly , i would mention the importance of european research .
i want to add a few comments to back up what i have just said .
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report .
reforms are also necessary in the labour market .
a reduction in working time may encourage employment , but only under certain conditions .
i would like to hear your opinion on this subject .
but it will take time .
the debate is closed .
mr president , this will now go forward to the council and the commission .
that is one thing .
i would like to hear what you have to say about this .
honourable members have also raised concerns about health and safety and the environment .
these are matters which the council is concerned to take into account in all its policies .
members were concerned about market access .
all of these programmes can provide close support to the changes in this industry , especially with regard to training .
finally , the last question involved financial action and support for research and development .
in this aspect , it is clear that respect for basic labour law standards is essential .
unfortunately , the commission action plan does not go far enough in this direction .
it is just as important that the commission and the council move in this direction from now on .
i am not going to discuss this again .
the debate is closed .
in short , we should use all the means the community has established over the years .
as yet there is no common legal framework , but only a decision to promote one .
young people at work or training in another european country will need a level of protection .
this would open up a whole new approach .
the debate is closed .
all these provisions are important .
this proposal is a step in the right direction .
i hope the commission will take particular account of amendment no 4 and i congratulate the rapporteur on his work .
it is our task to look at the political reasons .
this is one of the political reasons for the situation .
however , a small step has been taken and it is a good one .
mr president , commissioner , on behalf of the group of the european people 's party , i welcome the proposal of the commission .
for this reason , the group of the european people 's party will vote for the report .
i hope the commission will want to adopt them .
these are of course , as several others have said , important proposals . however , they are not enough and are only a first step .
in that context i should like to congratulate the rapporteur .
i thank all of you for the excellent work done here .
and that is the key point .
this is the start .
these tax aspects are under discussion with all involved parties in the context of the green paper .
the debate is closed .
i thank him again for his work .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and congratulate him .
this can have serious consequences .
for the individual concerned this is of course entirely unacceptable .
the debate is closed .
aspects relating to world trade
this situation cannot be allowed to go on .
and there are fundamental problems , mr president , there is a problem over the objectives of the two policies .
but i certainly hope they are doing this .
those are the basic aspects i wanted to comment on .
the debate is closed .
that is already much better , as this will establish it at least as a community initiative .
but there are two points to which i would like to draw your attention , commissioner .
it was a question of principle .
the council cannot decide until you have done so .
at the moment , i am not going to accept the amendment , but that does not mean i will never accept it .
i expressed it in this house after the european council in amsterdam .
the debate is closed .
that is quite clear .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
madam president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and his colleagues on the legal affairs committee who have brought this matter to our consideration today .
there are many concerns about content and i will refer to them in just a second .
but there are other fundamental rights .
madam president , i do not agree with some of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and accepted by the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights .
that is why my group is going to support it .
madam president , i would like to express my respect for the rapporteur and thank him for his excellent report .
this is an extremely important issue .
the debate is closed .
it is taken up in the directive , and we are very pleased about that .
so we are very pleased with this .
that is not going to happen with this directive .
a different directive achieved this at the level of production at an earlier stage .
parliament would like to follow this issue .
it is our job after all to ensure that europe has effective legislation .
to do so we need a lot more resources .
but there is also a second point in relation to this matter .
i do not think this is right .
for these reasons we will not vote for this action .
the commission and the member states are now called upon to play a very important role in this regard .
as regards the other amendments which have been tabled , the commission is not in a position to adopt them .
for these reasons the commission cannot accept the amendment .
the debate is closed .
that is not on , and under no circumstances can we can put up with it !
ecu 11 million this year , and next year we shall see .
the council says so , we know that , but there is no money for it !
so we will need to support investment .
the technology is there .
what do these words mean ?
nothing in reality .
how did the council see this ?
furthermore , the amendments are important , particularly amendment no 3 .
however , if you have a good environmental policy , then you should also pay less .
mr president , allow me to give a practical example .
thank you mr president .
and i hope the european parliament will support this proposal .
nor can the commission accept amendment no 10 concerning committee procedures .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
therefore , we support what is in the agreement but will not be voting for amendments to the joint resolution .
ladies and gentlemen , we cannot have yet another debate .
other members have asked to speak .
therefore , we cannot support any individual amendment at this stage .
vote for my amendment . that is why i tabled it .
mrs green , you are absolutely right .
we all agree with that .
that is what the house is voting for .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
paragraph 11
i would like to hear the rapporteur 's opinion .
i have asked the different groups in the committee .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we are going to vote on four amendments .
amendment no 1
your amendment has been adopted .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
this matter is now closed .
i cannot of course congratulate the rapporteur !
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , i really welcome this opportunity to speak .
mr president , i would like to make clear today why i vote against this resolution .
i want them to give them up .
those are the words of this house .
here too , parliament has an important political role to play in global stability and the development of third countries .
in view of the above , we have voted against the report .
i am in favour of a single currency .
it thus has a free hand .
that cannot go on any longer .
is that so certain ?
thus , we are voting in favour of the proposed directive . and we hope that a solution will be found to the problem in council .
so it is up to those of us with a say at eu level to put this right .
for the fact is , unemployment remains high in many of the union 's countries .
on the basis of this assessment , important reforms remain to be implemented .
on reading this report , never .
but that is not enough .
are there any comments ?
thank you .
we will do that .
( the minutes were approved )
the single currency
no amendments may be tabled .
i know that we do not want to have this debate .
we shall continue .
( applause ) that , with all of us working together - parliament and governments - is our task .
this was one of its main objectives .
economic conditions have never been so good .
it is not an end in itself .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is now up to you to vote .
finally , i want to make two points that are important to my group .
( applause )
these structural reforms would be necessary even without the euro .
money is a question of confidence .
we have always supported the idea of a single european currency .
this is a good thing .
and that too is a good thing .
democracy and social justice - these are the fundamental requirements for stability .
monetary union is a good thing , but it is certainly not everything .
( applause )
this is firstly because real political will has been shown .
( applause )
we will therefore vote against .
monetary union will change the face of europe .
price stability is essential for social and political stability .
we also need to make progress in the areas of employment and social policy .
we therefore need greater progress in the areas of common employment and social policy .
let us make the most of the opportunity .
( applause )
the market and currency europe must also become the people 's europe and environmental europe .
but that will not be the case .
that is why europe means less basic social requirements , less social protection , less solidarity .
of course we want to achieve stability in the european union .
that is very important .
on this day , 2 may , we are giving the green light to the euro .
i will not mention them all in my two minutes .
mr president , where is europe ?
it is our most important contribution to a new world order .
finally , we are there , ladies and gentlemen .
finally , the euro is going to exist .
they have established the conditions necessary for high and sustainable levels of growth and employment .
as regards employment , we must be clear .
for this reason it has our support .
mr president , today is a day for hope .
the process has been long and difficult .
we need to make progress towards the coordination of economic policies .
let us make a start today on that new economic and social project .
a large internal market can only work with a common currency .
however , the euro is of itself no guarantee .
employment really has to become the main objective for europe .
the european framework has been good for ireland .
it will be better still with the single currency and it will be good for all small member states .
this needs to be the eu 's objective .
it will be good for you , it will be good for us , it will be good for everyone !
let me say one other thing .
the debate is closed .
after the euro , we have to make europe .
we have to make all our citizens understand that europe today is all about a single currency but tomorrow it will be about political union .
today the single currency is a reality . this is a lot , a great deal , but it is not everything .
of course , the instrument will be different .
'
it cannot be said that there will be no problems or difficulties .
i am full of hope for the success of the euro .
it will never be enough .
we must therefore look towards the future .
those of its citizens who want to use the euro , will be able to .
those who do not will not have to . they can continue to use our national currency .
but , for me , it is only a stage and not an end in itself .
however that is not to say that there will not be problems .
this situation cannot be allowed to continue .
the euro is an instrument .
this will not have been the case in the monetary field .
it does not really take our economic environment into account .
for the nations of europe , for the european union and for the world .
since we respect the rules of democracy , a decision of our parliament , even one with which we do not agree , is law .
if it is law , we shall respect it as such .
but that is not the case today .
there is nothing to support this hope .
this is why you cannot do it .
jobs , in my view , are as important as price stability .
i have voted against the euro for all of these reasons .
will there be a green euro ?
there is no response from the commission .
the europe of monetary union must also be the citizens ' europe .
in the long term this will certainly have a positive impact on the employment situation .
which nations ?
where is the democracy ?
where is the concern for the common good ?
but this policy does not address the will of the people .
it is a means to political union .
unfortunately , this has not been made clear to the citizens of europe .
now that the decision has been made , we must all hope that the single currency is a success .
i am aware of the importance of the decision we have just taken .
they are right .
thank you very much .
i shall do so .
i will return to this later .
with that i would like to call for this report to be approved .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
i have been rapporteur for ten years .
if this directive is adopted , i shall have everything that i want .
but we do not know that yet .
that is not acceptable !
what are we dealing with here ?
how can we expect to create jobs ?
this is not just a directive for european industry .
research means investment .
investment means jobs .
we shall take this decision tomorrow .
( applause )
the question has been open for more than ten years .
madam president , my group will be voting against this directive .
i take issue with that .
i really regard this as a very serious matter for parliament !
that is not the task of the european parliament .
that is why there are some amendments to the common position which we simply must accept .
jobs play a role in this too .
the common position does not guarantee this ' .
did we adopt these amendments for nothing ?
madam president , i would like to thank the president for all his hard work .
both have good reasons .
i hope , therefore , that this house will adopt this amendment this morning .
europe must not be left behind .
however , what the agriculture committee wanted , and what this parliament voted for , has not been included .
no : this is a good text .
that is not true .
that has not been done .
they did not when we discussed the matter recently in brussels .
that is something we should put right .
so today we are discussing our own text .
i am very pleased at this decision of the committee .
the european parliament will be able to question it at will , based on a procedure which the parliament itself must establish .
it is only for that reason that the commission does not believe it is necessary to mention this aspect .
that is the first thing .
the debate is closed .
that is an important matter .
it was not always clear when they had to do this .
and i think that is how it should be .
that seems wrong to me .
i should like to comment on the institutional aspect of this problem .
on the other hand , i agree , what is this communication based on ?
finally , madam president , two points .
the debate is closed .
thank you .
are there any more comments ?
thank you very much .
thank you .
mr president , the same applies to me , i was present , but i am not in the minutes either !
( parliament approved the minutes )
i have no further information .
( parliament agreed to the request for urgent procedure )
thank you , commissioner .
in some countries it is as much as 10 % .
this is the key to our success .
this will allow us to reach all young people .
the resolution before us is a good resolution .
in principle , as things look at the moment , we will be able to vote for his report .
we already know this for a fact .
the problem here , the problem with this report , is that it is trying to reform a society which does not see things the same way .
this seems important to me .
i would like thank him for this .
it seems that almost five million young people are taking drugs within the european union .
in conclusion , mr president , i would like to mention a recent experience .
they are quite right to put their side of the case so that we can reply to it .
i thank him for his efforts .
i would also like to add something to the report before us .
we shall accept the report for all these reasons .
it just will not happen .
that is why i think we have to let each member state deal with this issue in its own way .
of course there should be a coordination of activities ; of course there should be cooperation .
this is a very serious issue .
but there it is .
the report is before us this morning .
the strategy has so far been effective .
my hope is that we will be able to go further still .
the debate is closed .
with the 1999 community budget these objectives can be achieved .
with a final major effort , the full amount of funds for structural actions will have to be made available .
the final effort for 1999 is certainly considerable .
in any case , commissioner , this is not the time to start a debate .
the debate is closed .
such a thing is unacceptable .
the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights did not talk about public health .
that will also be used and not a general article .
there is a basis .
that is why it is being referred back to the commission .
the council 's legal service has also said no .
within this parliament , i would wish our main priority to be that of the defence of public health .
they expect parliament to take a political decision .
let the court of justice decide on the issue of a legal basis , if it is referred to them . that is their right .
we therefore have no problem in voting for the text of the common position .
i will not support any of the amendments .
let us simply ask why rather than how we are doing this .
this is something which we should all become involved in .
no , not everyone , but the majority !
we all agree about the objectives .
i believe that we must take a more global approach to this subject .
of course we need this .
that is the legal position .
mr president , it is quite clear that this house has to support this common position or nothing .
i think that there are two important things to note here .
i am on your side as far as that is concerned .
the report today must be supported as it is a real and positive step in the right direction .
mr president , we can only come to a different decision if we no longer take our own legal services seriously .
ladies and gentlemen , let us continue to take this seriously .
we have the opportunity now , later we may not .
we are in favour of health and in favour of life .
health , we are all agreed .
what type of measures can the community take ?
europe must therefore play a full role .
i hope the european union will follow us with regard to this issue .
i therefore believe that we need to deal with these problems as well .
i think we need to act in this way .
there is clearly a legal problem .
the answer is two things .
what we are dealing with is a european directive .
the european union is a community in law .
it is also clear from the procedure that we are dealing here with a health directive .
mr president , i have a point of order .
i for one doubt it !
and i look forward to the day when we can stop it .
i was not able to get full agreement but i was able to achieve some progress in that regard .
we have to put an end to that here .
it was adopted without amendments by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
the common position also takes into account the special case of existing products .
it is this common position or nothing !
( applause )
the debate is closed .
we can stop these comments here .
mr president , i have a point of order .
but i believe the european citizens have a right to know !
( applause )
members of this house , this debate must be closed .
i cannot allow more than two or three of you to speak .
( applause from the green group )
mr president , on a point of order .
could we now move to the vote ?
i just wanted to draw this fact to your attention .
thank you , mr president .
thank you .
it is a good point for us , so carry on !
that is not how it is done .
that is against the rules of the house .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is not what we have said , but it does not mean this is not what we have done .
mr president , i voted for some of the amendments to this directive .
( the president .
no , no !
however there is a parliamentary practice and this was mentioned to you by our colleagues of the president-in-office .
i will therefore allow you to speak as i did for the other members .
that was not referred to at all .
this has been achieved .
for all these reasons i will vote for the directive .
i am voting against this proposal for many reasons .
we have to deal with that .
i believe that what is important now is to ensure that this change of direction is also taken up by the individual member states .
crime has also been given the green light .
we should say no to the amsterdam treaty and no to drugs .
that is not at all a good thing .
water quality
mr president , this is the second reading on this subject , having had the first reading one year ago .
i am very pleased about this .
the directive we have in place at the moment has not really been well implemented .
it is not the whole industry , but some areas of it .
today , we are dealing with an important motion here .
mr president , like others i welcome this directive and the report on it .
clearly something has to be done about that .
the same applies to the question the rapporteur asked the commission .
the commission has proposed 15 years , and this has been accepted by the council .
therefore , we see no reason to propose a change to council .
thank you for your attention .
i think this is particularly serious .
the debate is closed .
the next item is a joint debate on the following reports :
i should like to congratulate the commission on its proposal .
this is very important .
i would also like to take the opportunity to thank the commission for its excellent work .
but what is good can naturally always be made better .
we should , however , stress that this measure is also important for local air quality .
they should be included ; there is no doubt about it .
mr president , madam commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are dealing here with an internal market problem and with an environmental protection problem .
but at the same time there is also the internal market aspect .
and then there is also the environmental aspect .
other action needs to be taken .
is it a market measure or is it a measure to protect the environment ?
they are a major step forward .
nevertheless , the commission 's proposal seems acceptable overall .
this is a positive step .
in conclusion i would like to add one more thing .
this would thus not cause a problem .
certain countries have already achieved more .
it is a good report on a very serious environmental problem .
i call on you to support these amendments and i would also like to ask the commission if it is prepared to accept them .
however , for us all it is a matter of the health of the people of europe .
we all know that this is a question of law for which the european court of justice has developed clear criteria .
in this case we have the same conditions and the same legal basis .
you know that , madam commissioner .
firstly , i will consider the report on the proposal on air quality .
this proposal is the first that the commission has tabled under the framework directive on the assessment and management of air quality .
thus , part of amendment no 10 cannot be accepted .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur .
but what about the issue ?
we have also tabled such an amendment .
the commission has taken note of the points in the financial review .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
that is the reason for what has happened to your question .
my question concerns the proposed legislation put forward by the commission to the council of ministers to guarantee freedom of movement .
of course , you know how this matter has developed .
i believe it is working quite well on the whole .
commissioner , thank you .
my questions to you today are these .
that is a positive result .
that is the situation .
we have always said that that must not be allowed .
that is wrong .
thank you very much , commissioner .
you have the floor .
these are all clear legal regulations .
but the question of course , and this is the only important question , is what effect do they have in practice ?
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
but that would not get us much further .
this is the only solution which will work .
so far it has not been a priority .
subject : protection of the community 's financial interests
this will change with the amsterdam treaty , when it comes into force .
i think we should also look at what initiatives to take in order to put this into practice .
she will know , therefore , precisely what the legal position is .
i would like to thank the commissioner for the answer .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
will it all work in practice ?
this is the real problem that we have to address .
what is the role of the european union ?
this is precisely the role of this house .
i think that is one of the things which should concern us at a time like this .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we will be able to help with this .
however , our responsibility does not end there .
mr president , i wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this report .
in the european parliament we have quite rightly adopted a strong stand on human rights issues .
however , a number of comments do need to be made on this agreement .
time will tell .
what sense is there in saying " no ' ?
of course not .
the debate is closed .
we do not want it to be done in a committee procedure .
i am not prepared to compromise on this point , commissioner .
is it to ask a question ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
very well .
( the minutes were approved )
i have made a note of it .
thank you , mrs green .
as a result , practical dialogue with the european parliament will be very important .
( applause )
this is a good way forward .
( applause )
this should not be a party political matter .
they also state that the european central bank is independent .
we hope that today 's debate will not provide an opportunity for that .
what conclusions should we draw from this ?
i rather doubt it .
in short , a high level of employment .
on these two points we must have serious discussions with the european central bank .
this we simply cannot accept .
i have one comment and one question .
that was my comment .
the question i wanted to ask is the following .
it is also not a vote against monetary union .
this is the same the world over .
however , in its activities the european central bank will be completely independent .
i want to add only two things .
the debate is closed .
that is good .
this must be the commitment of the european union as a whole and not just a few states .
i hope that the european union will become fully involved in the vital issues of this serious crisis .
that is in line with the draft resolution which is before parliament .
thank you , president-in-office .
so , what have we done ?
why did we decide to do that ?
thank you , commissioner , for what you have just said .
something should be done about this , too .
this seems wrong to me .
mr president , i am still not entirely clear .
that was my question .
mr president , i do not propose to say what the other members have said .
thank you very much , mr president .
we shall begin the vote .
the text itself is not put to the vote .
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that will be our task over the next five years .
' .
they put pressure on a number of member states to change their position within the council .
i do not think they would .
we have united to create a single currency .
six years after the first reading , the council has finally reached a common position .
the text is the result of difficult negotiations .
i do not agree .
a great step forward has been taken in the area of public health protection .
as a consumer i have the right to know which products are on the market and what these products offer .
where should we draw the line ?
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
but where will it take us ?
is that what we want ?
i can see no legal basis for the common position in the treaty on european union .
the question of the legal basis of a text is therefore always fundamental .
it only took one year !
we should congratulate ourselves on this .
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
the people have a right to expect no less .
we are all pleased about them .
we shall therefore not vote for the report .
europe has to reform this legislative framework .
we welcome the proposals by the commission and the amendments from this parliament .
and this policy is working .
in the interests of the consumer , we can only hope that this will indeed be the case .
but , we must see things clearly .
i do not really think it will .
i agree with the rapporteur that opportunities to take part in the programmes need to be increased .
the commission has not provided any solution .
such results should be taken into consideration in the new programmes and / or new actions .
common defence policy
this is where we are at present .
this first part was approved over a year ago .
at the moment we are discussing the second part , defence , and we are called in this parliament to give our decision on it tomorrow .
on the one hand we have economic and monetary union .
this is a great initiative , if you will allow me to say so .
we had to fight for this , but it has been achieved .
mr president , this is the contribution from the committee on budgets .
this report is without a doubt an important contribution to the debate .
it really is in this context that the report should be seen .
now , for that foreign policy to be effective , it is also essential that it should include a defence policy .
why do we not want to use them ?
that will not be the case .
another important point is greater democracy .
i agree with him absolutely .
and the same obviously goes for the future members of the union .
in principle the union must be able to take military action on its own .
perhaps it is more a matter for the council , but i would like his opinion .
( applause from the green group )
in this respect the eu has been a total success .
this is important .
there is no doubt that your report will be voted for by the european parliament .
europe will soon have a single currency .
the task was indeed a difficult one , as i know from our work together on the committee .
mr president , i just have a comment on the rules of procedure relating to speaking time .
but as you have already taken the floor , you no longer need to speak at the end of the debate .
because what is the question here ?
what is the objective ?
they both amount to the same thing .
perhaps we should stop talking about it and actually get on and do it !
such full employment is not one of the eu 's basic principles .
a security policy is therefore not the same as a military defence .
it is also for you , he said , your security and your defence !
for this reason it is important that we continue to follow this process in this house , as we are doing today .
what the union needs above all , and i have often said so , is positive practical experience .
so i would like to turn it all around .
the best contribution the european union can make to security in europe is its enlargement .
i have already mentioned a few reasons for this .
the debate is closed .
minister , the european union 's first great initiative in terms of foreign and security policy must be nuclear .
it seems to me therefore that it requires a political response .
i have not seen anything of this kind so far .
the question then will be : what is our position ?
the debate is closed .
agenda
madam president , on a point of order .
i shall therefore propose a compromise to your proposal .
madam president , i have only one thing to say .
madam president , on a point of order .
many thanks !
if you are in agreement i will take that as being decided .
kosovo
mr president , thank you for the opportunity to take part in this debate on kosovo .
the first is to step up the pressure .
a proposal of this kind will soon reach the council .
we know this .
i believe that a very significant step has been taken here .
we cannot be sure of this , however .
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , i have a number of questions .
do the council and the commission have any information on the subject ?
question time ( council )
but if he is not present we must still carry on with the debate .
you were here when we approved the agenda .
just a few words , mr president .
it is a very important issue .
the honourable member has raised a very relevant point .
i would like to thank the president-in-office .
i thank the honourable member for his question .
there is now , i understand , an opinion from parliament on those matters .
you have the right to reply or not to reply .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
i very much agree with the point raised by the honourable member that there is a need and it is proper that the european union should be involved .
i thank the honourable member for his question .
it is important to make progress little by little , if that is the only way that progress can be made .
i cannot really add to what i have already said on the action .
i am very pleased with that but i would like to ask him if there is not some further action we can take .
we have , of course , only today discussed a report on this question in parliament .
subject : common military defence
i would like to thank the honourable member for her question .
the position which was adopted in amsterdam is a position which is acceptable to all the countries within the union .
there are different views on that matter .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
i hope that it is now clear to everyone that this is not possible .
we must go one step further . we must put forward proposals and these proposals can be put forward .
it is an important issue .
i do not need to go on .
last year it was 10 % .
so this is a very serious matter .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
i will mention five of them in particular .
these are the basis of a sustainable information society .
i expect guidelines based on measures to promote public and private investment .
structural reforms are required .
i am saying this because it is important for the business sector as a whole , as well as for industry .
i will mention only two or three of them .
i believe , however , that it is a major problem because , quite simply , it concerns employment .
i shall address three matters that are not included , but should have been .
i also think that a competition policy like the one being implemented is a positive measure .
this in itself is very positive .
both countries have come through this change with great success .
we now have enough projects in this area .
we should continue them .
this has nothing to do with environmental technology .
this means that , as always in life , we must compromise and we must also sometimes set priorities .
we must now take action .
even if we do something wrong it is still better than doing nothing at all .
the debate is closed .
the european union should take its opportunity this time .
i agreed with my colleagues on many points .
so i look forward with interest to the commissioner 's response .
i know this is already a commission initiative .
without this , it will not work .
it has already been mentioned .
on that point we will have to reach decisions .
perhaps you could tell us something about this .
the effects on unemployment could be considerable .
these new opportunities in turn create completely new service opportunities .
we want international agreements and coordination .
this also applies to data protection , for example .
in the council we have a working party .
we can always think about this coordination point .
for this reason there is no cause for concern .
data protection is a very important example .
for this reason i would not be concerned about this .
the debate is closed .
i look forward to the support of this house for the second reading .
in this respect i believe that the council 's common position is a good one .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , technical standards and regulations are an extremely important instrument of economic policy .
the debate is closed .
i congratulate him on it .
i very much hope that the commission will be able to make some comment about that .
the rapporteur 's proposal for this is also acceptable to us .
i believe those were the questions i was to discuss .
i hope that the final decision will soon follow .
the debate is closed .
but perhaps that is the role of a commissioner .
in the first issue we are now in agreement with the discussion in the council .
we will see when the time comes .
i will say that once again quite clearly .
i am very much prepared to say that it is simply the majority opinion .
we do not do justice to this interest . this is my opinion and , so far , also the opinion of the commission .
this is completely clear !
mr president , i have one short question for the commissioner .
have some confidence in the people .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
there are a number of other important areas that still remain outside the democratic control of the european parliament .
we are going to support it .
and we are also going to support some of the amendments , which improve the text .
mr president , as i said at the beginning of my speech , it is a good text with which to begin our work .
' and it did !
it might have taken longer - or indeed , not so long !
but let us get back to the essential issues .
why does the european parliament not wish to take its political role more seriously ?
that is the extent of your report , which is nevertheless excellent .
i consider this report to be very important indeed .
however , i would like to say something about the rapporteur 's basic strategy .
we are now well past that date , so perhaps that decision was not quite the right one . however , as has been said , we shall have to deal with the second part later .
of course but , by way of reply , we do not have one !
those are the two questions i wanted to ask , and i would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
firstly , economic and monetary union .
i find this an excellent proposal , and i think we should do it - not just in relation to the area discussed in the report , but also in other areas .
they have that at least in common with members of the european parliament .
mr president , the european parliament must fight for its democratic rights .
we shall have to fight for these rights .
i think it is something we can take into consideration .
the debate is closed .
information and communication policy
i must draw your attention to this .
other institutions could become involved in this .
it is this point in particular which has created difficulties in the past .
what will it be like in 1999 , if the policy does not change ?
we need more money .
all of this is extremely important to us .
the report goes further , however .
that is not the case .
ladies and gentlemen , to this we can only say no !
mr president , information policy is an important aspect of democratic culture , but it is also a power issue .
we are therefore voting for the amendments which go in this direction .
to a certain extent this is true .
how could the commission have allowed this situation to continue for so long ?
mr president , the european parliament is not very successful in its information policy .
how many citizens of the eu are aware of the legislative rights of this house ?
as we discussed here earlier this morning , that is also important for democracy .
but what does he mean by this ?
i do not share this view .
in this matter , our only responsibility is to the european parliament .
they have agreed to improve coordination of european information .
i support it too .
i want to congratulate him on his initiative .
i think it will be hard for the commission to adopt a legislative proposal on this question by that date .
on all these points , i fully share the rapporteur 's views .
the debate is closed .
welcome
we take it in good part .
if it really is for a point of order , it will be the last .
we have a lot of amendments .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
madam president , on a point of order .
' .
'
( parliament adopted the resolution )
in paragraph 3 we call on them to begin this dialogue .
' .
this is all that is in paragraph 3 .
ladies and gentlemen , there is something i do not understand .
at the end you can always vote against .
we were within the framework of the procedure .
you cannot begin at the beginning again .
one thing which is certain is that we are not going to start a debate on the matter .
more than this we do not know .
we therefore have nothing new to add .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
good , i think the house is now clear on this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
but that is the end of it .
i would like us to continue with the vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it is part of the procedure which we have adopted .
thank you , mrs green .
security policy is therefore not the same thing as military defence .
many of the eu member states do not accept a common defence policy .
parliament does not have the right to decide on a common defence policy .
we cannot support the report .
then we can develop a common defence policy .
i support the development of an eu defence policy .
it does no such thing .
we therefore had to vote against the report .
it does not need another one .
do i need to say it again ?
we obviously do not agree with this type of procedure .
the powers of the council must also increase .
i share his view entirely .
that is not , however , enough .
this is the aim of this motion .
the debate is closed .
this is something we cannot accept .
that is why it is so important for us in this parliament to make a statement today .
those are concerns people have about any nuclear energy .
the debate is closed .
it is not an act of nature .
we really must demand that these human rights representatives are given better protection as they go about their work .
this is no way to achieve democracy . this is no solution .
we have seen what this can lead to .
turkey
we can only hope that this will be the case .
human rights are not simply an internal matter for a state .
the military way is no solution .
but that is not enough .
this is absolutely unacceptable .
this situation really must come to an end .
clear action to deal with the crisis will have the most effect .
that is the first point .
we have to adopt a clear position here .
thank you very much .
i think he has had some problems recently .
for us , the moment to act is now .
so we know what this may mean .
it is only one step , but it is an important step .
the joint debate is closed .
at last an initiative was to be taken at european level .
the commission obviously also has a job to do in this .
the joint debate is closed .
and in the third amendment , we also think the european commission has a responsibility .
can we have a decision from the commission ?
secondly , it is possible to act through the structural policies procedure .
i want to make that clear .
so it will be possible to provide an answer to this situation too .
the joint debate is closed .
but this is not included in the report .
in my opinion this is entirely the wrong course to take .
the first question asked is why such a policy is needed in the first place .
i have therefore voted against the report .
' .
we refer to the question of safety , which in this type of transport must be given priority in the context of the community and international competition rules .
we believe that is not acceptable .
you cannot do the second without the first .
that is not something we wish to see .
i do not see why we cannot agree to give these instruments to the commission . we can ask ourselves why this has not been possible .
better still , we welcome them because they improve the text . there are other amendments , such as the one dealing with public service , and so on .
the debate is closed .
i believe that members of this parliament will also benefit from this , but that is just by the by .
here i agree with the rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
we have , for the most part , accepted this view .
i expect we can agree with the commission on this .
i supported this at the conference .
that is the only way in which we can achieve the necessary long term stability .
they have certainly given us a lot to think about .
we often hear it said that europe is involved in too many things .
that would not be in the best interests of either farmers or consumers .
let me now move on to the second item in this joint debate .
the rapporteur has asked for the floor .
madam president , i would like to look at this question once again , for it seems to me to be an important one .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
after the vote on the amendments
i am sure that cooperation between the commission and the member states will improve over time .
these are the reasons why i voted against the commission 's proposals .
in fact , at the present time , we have no common external policy in the area of air transport .
both these views are wrong !
that is a lot of money !
both of these initiatives are right .
secondly , what has been proposed is good , but it does not go far enough .
but that does not matter , it is the result that is important .
that is a further reason for legal proposals in this area .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we believe it is not .
the measures mentioned here are all international .
we have thus voted against the legislative resolution .
we already know a great deal today , but we can never be too sure .
would it possible , commissioner , for us to see those reports ?
i would hope that , after this debate , the house will give it its full support .
today , we are voting on a joint motion for a resolution .
i would like to encourage everyone to do so .
however , it is also absolutely crucial for the commission to understand the issues involved and to come up with a positive response .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
that is why this issue is such a very important one at this time .
the issue actually means taking a position on reforms for the whole of eu agricultural policy and the creation of a european agricultural policy .
that is why i give my support to the joint motion for a resolution .
it is clearly in this area that work must begin .
it is a political decision that is needed .
it will naturally continue to do so in future .
does the commissioner not back this point of view ?
it would be entirely appropriate to deal with your concern under this item .
i do not believe that this is really a matter in which research is necessary .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
for all those reasons , mr president , we must congratulate germany and the european institutions , since the political objective has been achieved .
what we are dealing with is the past .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , even though he is not here today , for the work that he has done .
there are no amendments .
policy has to be implemented under the terms of eu regulations .
different assistance conditions applied in each case for the measures in question .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we can wish for anything we like .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
however , ladies and gentlemen , although that is important we do not think it is enough .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
agenda
i would like to ask a question .
both of those key priorities have already been achieved .
let me start with the issue of economic reform .
if we are to get it right , we need to make sure that we share the best practice in each of those areas .
( applause )
mention should also be made of the progress towards a creation of a more effective common foreign and security policy .
we want a great success because , let us face it , the presidency at the present time needs a success .
let us be more positive , we want to see a success .
first we need to see real progress on agenda 2000 .
the third really important aspect , as the president-in-office of council has mentioned , is employment .
what will you have to show for it ?
what is good for the financial markets is not good for them .
in france too , jobs for the young .
monetary union is now a reality .
the situation now is that they have all done their job .
one last point .
something more has to be done in this area .
as regards the environment , allow me to say that we need both people and nature , and not nature without people !
perhaps for once you could do something about this .
i want to congratulate the british presidency .
the first is the reform of the labour markets .
that is the fundamental point !
are we doing it ?
no , we are not !
so we have to change things .
what will we change ?
to do so we should use all our resources in all the institutions and in the member states .
they say and we pay .
that is not good for them and it is not good for us .
it is not always the same country .
the problem we have in turkey is not actually a problem we have in europe .
turkey is not a member of the european union .
it is not a party to the common foreign and security policy .
we will have more power in the world .
the question we have to ask ourselves is how do we use that power ?
they go hand in hand .
we are talking about a common security and foreign policy .
last year was also the year of agenda 2000 .
what should be the objectives of an eu common foreign and security policy ? first of all , security in europe .
i should like to know the council 's view .
there is a great deal to be said .
i just do not have the time .
only a well prepared and implemented common foreign and security policy can bring about any change in this situation .
as the report says : public opinion does not value it . that is a fact .
i can also agree with a further three points .
did they change the reality ?
i know that this is a problem .
i have just come back from turkey .
that is up to the member states .
the debate is closed .
the political commitment is there .
let us be clear .
the commission has mentioned that already .
we have a clear part to play .
that is far too high .
but the result can be a real agreement .
we need that , mr president .
we must pay great attention to these matters .
i would like to focus attention on four points .
now is the time for the eu to show that will !
there is an old saying : where there 's a will , there 's a way .
what has the eu done ?
unfortunately , it is up to the council to decide .
the debate is closed .
economic policy guidelines of the member states and the community
we are dealing with a global market .
decisions taken by the european council on economic policy guidelines are a particularly important instrument in this regard .
the european union must place economic policy in the service of employment .
in my view , this is either too much or too little .
this support is important for two reasons .
it seems to me more of a local concern .
the debate is closed .
the rapporteur is not yet here .
what i wanted to do is this .
why is that so ?
from that moment forward , things change .
naturally , i will only address those concerning the commission .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the answer would be : " agreed , that is how things are at present ' , and " agreed , that is how we want to change things in future ' .
that 's not my point !
in that respect , the president is certainly right !
but that will not change anything .
having said that , our priority must always be how we can help the people of europe .
the debate is closed .
i hope that parliament will be able to support the report tomorrow .
the initiative is left entirely to the member states .
the commission has already presented a number of proposals .
if we take that as our measure , then there is an urgent need for action .
we should support the proposal as it is .
if we adopt it as it is , we shall be taking a step forward .
at the same time , it goes without saying that the free movement of workers is an important right of the internal market .
the commission can in principle agree with the need for community action .
the debate is closed .
that really makes no sense at all in an internal market .
that is why , commissioner , we support your proposal .
so i , together with members of this honourable house , look forward to its progress into law .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i think they should have been taken by now .
what am i trying to say , ladies and gentlemen ?
why do we think that ?
these are very important developments .
we are talking about completely different products and markets .
so i am in favour of this report being approved .
the debate is closed .
however , some of the amendments which the parliament supported following my report have not been accepted .
a further amendment has not been accepted by the council .
mr president , madam commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we support the common position and consider that it has taken account of our draft amendments .
it will not lead to any progress .
it also accepted a large number of the amendments proposed by parliament on the first reading .
the debate is closed .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first let me thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done .
i think that is wrong , mr president .
that can sometimes be a problem .
it cannot do the same for the other amendments .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i am in favour of it .
we shall take note of that .
( the minutes were approved )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i would therefore ask the commission to think again about this project .
i hope that as from today it changes course .
that , madam president , is something the commission and the council should think about .
madam president , first of all i have a few comments regarding the committee on employment and social affairs .
madam president , these are the views of the committee on employment and social affairs .
however , we have a number of comments and one question which we would like to put to the commissioner .
and so on .
no progress has been made on this point and i think that progress here is needed .
madam president , we have two very important reports before us today .
we can do better on funds .
as we move towards the end of this year and into next year we will have some very important decisions to take .
each has its own different problems : each is particular .
they have not had that access or opportunity .
mr president , we have before us three important and good reports .
so we are going to support amendments nos 1 , 2 and 3 which state that we are talking about the period up to 1999 .
i thank the commissioner for her work in this area .
madam president , ireland is a good example of the effective use of structural funds .
i hope we will get a clear commitment from the commissioner this morning in this respect .
so that is a completely different question .
it has reached some of them , but not all of them .
however , one comment needs to be made .
unemployment is 2 % .
unemployment is 20 % .
here too there is certainly greater agreement between the commission and parliament than between the commission and the member states .
but we cannot measure everyone by the same standards .
i thank the commissioner for her speech .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is not my position at all .
those who want to see a common currency must also be prepared to take this into account in their national legislation .
we wish to see a proper reform of agriculture policy in 1999 .
i would like to refer to two possible areas of policy discussion .
4 ) .
but how do we move towards this objective ?
no !
an increase in private investment is necessary for growth and employment .
this is , in my opinion , a national concern .
the eu countries currently have very different requirements on the question of employment policy .
we are actually doing one thing and saying we are giving priority to the other .
how long will this go on ?
will it go on until society cannot put up with it any longer ?
we accept the report for two quite different reasons :
it is more than urgent !
it is vital !
this matter should have been given more attention in the report .
we therefore fully understand the problems .
this must be taken into account during the implementation of the proposal .
thank you for your comment .
are there any comments ?
( applause )
mr president , i wish to speak about something that does not concern the minutes , but is a question of procedure .
mr president , i just wish to make two points .
if the commission is not going to make a statement about this week , why not ?
this is not the time .
i do think that some consideration should be given to these points .
of course , i expect that members of the groups will discuss these matters within their own groups and reach a final decision on it .
you can be absolutely certain of that .
i also have a second comment .
( the minutes were approved )
i do not think it is always all that good .
that is my first point .
why not ?
in that case there is no problem .
obviously this is not the case in this parliament .
the debate is closed .
clear criteria and procedures will increase the transparency of eu policy .
for that matter , this also applies to the start of the procedure .
mr president , we support this request and particularly the idea behind it , although in our opinion it does not go far enough .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but there are still issues of concern , that the rapporteur 's amendments address , and that we would wish to support .
this proposal is currently under the cooperation procedure .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i too wish to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done .
there are also member states who want it .
this is not acceptable to us , however .
what are specific issues ?
i am of the opinion that the points made in the common position are responsible , and i would like this directive also to take effect if possible .
i can support what is proposed in the common position .
the debate is closed .
a good thing is not always the best thing .
the agreements have been a clear step forward .
i hope that parliament will take a step forward in this matter .
the agreements were wrong before , they are still wrong and we see no reason to change our mind .
and we hope it is approved by a large majority in the house , as it was in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
i thus share the opinion of our rapporteur , and i congratulate him on the quality of his work .
these are some of the many questions to which we have no answer .
why ?
mr president , i would like to say that i agree with the report .
the debate is closed .
mr president , as far as i am concerned , there are some difficulties with this agreement .
it is a very clear report and i should like to support everything it says , on behalf of my group .
at least , i think , this is a start .
we support this report and congratulate the rapporteur once again on his work .
the council has some responsibility in this too .
however , we have had to say it over and over again .
this is very important .
the commission can accept amendments nos 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 in principle , if not in their present form .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
( parliament approved urgent procedure )
( parliament approved urgent procedure )
( parliament approved urgent procedure )
the next item is the joint debate on two reports on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development :
they have in general supported me , and i should therefore like to thank them for this .
now i should like to say a few words about the budget situation in 1999 .
the reform is in progress and should be presented to us this week .
i therefore tabled a number of amendments on this point , which were furthermore adopted by the committee on agriculture .
we all agree on that aspect of the matter .
then again , there is the committee on the environment .
i cannot accept this for three reasons .
there is no economic reason to favour one kind over another .
we could , in effect , consider taking this problem into account .
i will come to this now .
having said that , the commission has come forward with a report that is a good deal better than the system that we have at present .
why not go back , commissioner , and start again ?
that is why we do not agree with the commission proposal .
my group will therefore support the general terms of the commission proposals .
and to what extent is it better quality ?
i have not heard you say that , commissioner .
and where is your concern about quality , commissioner ?
are you concerned about quality or are you not ?
where will these people go ?
young farmers are just not coming into the industry .
the eu should be doing the same .
i support this proposal .
because of all this , commissioner , we are going to vote in favour of your proposal .
in any case , the road to reform is open .
that does not make sense .
the debate is closed .
agenda 2000 : economic and social cohesion
it can only help the common good .
let me be quite clear about this .
i shall however report to you on the opinion of the committee on regional policy .
i should therefore like to thank them .
will we be able to expect this ?
much more could be done about the quality of agricultural products .
this can be an effective new market for agricultural products .
i would like to know the number .
however , the commission has not done this .
but the document says nothing about the future of european agriculture .
in the same sense , what role do we really want the aid to have ?
but the report is , of course , global .
they also give a certain type of aid .
how can we do this ?
and he makes proposals for the future .
there are a number of points i wish to make .
on the one hand they want enlargement while , on the other hand , they are not prepared to pay for it .
member states are going to have to face up to that principle no matter what approach they take .
we need to promote employment in rural areas .
nor will it be in future .
although this regulation was adopted some years ago , it is not always implemented .
what do we have here ?
therefore we cannot support it .
we think the commission 's proposal is better than the draft report from the committee on agriculture and rural development .
it is our opinion that there needs to be a proper reform before 1999 .
they cannot come about through our vote .
we have come such a long way !
it was an important debate .
we do not agree with this .
i am voting in favour of the report that has just been presented to us for three main reasons .
various aspects need to be taken into consideration .
so what kind of european agriculture model do we want for the future ?
does agenda 2000 really offer us this ?
nevertheless , young farmers are our only guarantee of a future for european agriculture .
in addition , there is no solidarity between the regions .
but the most important issues are , firstly , that we have a single market and that single market for agriculture must remain across europe .
this was necessary .
unfortunately , a number of reform measures tabled by the commission do not take this approach into consideration .
what does the commission propose , in its communication on agenda 2000 ?
so what proposals has the commission made with regard to those discussions ?
what strategy is the commission going to adopt ?
the debate is closed .
2000 : economic and social cohesion
so i do not think there is any problem on our part .
and that could cause problems in the future .
in the general context of the agreement , i should like to mention a point we think is perhaps fundamental .
all of this must be done . thus , for me it is still a point for discussion .
moreover , solidarity does not mean taking more assistance than necessary .
those who demand things for themselves also achieve things for others .
less than a year is not much time .
there are also further amendments .
we will vote on it tomorrow . then we will finally have a result .
but i believe it is important that this step has been taken .
what is the aim of all this ?
it is also a question of working together to improve and develop an instrument of aid , and of how we get along together .
how ?
in this regard , some colleagues are indeed right .
for this reason it is also important that we include , for example , expenditure on agriculture .
so the cohesion fund is an essential instrument .
one is not possible without the other .
mr president , on a point of order .
the debate is closed .
there is much more i could say about my report .
that amendment is the subject of our report .
i will now turn to the question of proper conditions of competition , which i know is very important to many of the members of this house .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
mr president , i think we are in agreement on the most important points .
the one has nothing to do with the other .
you must look into that .
thank you for your reply .
for this reason it is not appropriate for the commission to comment on whether national legislation is in agreement with individual provisions of the european convention .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
but are there not also eu standards now ?
but it will also need to be acceptable to the various member states .
and i think we are at least going to try to achieve that .
a few years ago that was not possible , because we did not have the instruments to do it .
this is no longer the case .
he is not with us .
it is a difficult case .
that is right and it has my support .
for all those things , i think training is essential .
that is a step in the same direction as the honourable member was just talking about .
but i have not given you the floor .
why are you speaking ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
when are we really going to see something practical done about this urgent matter ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
could you say more precisely what these measures concerned ?
this is just one example of what may be discussed .
so we have an agreement .
it could happen that some of these reports will be of very little use to our services . sometimes they may be of more use .
it is not for taking the final decision .
that is the general context .
i would ask you to understand one thing .
i hope you will allow us to continue to do so .
obviously we allowed them to look into the document .
this is a general rule .
i very much hope that this house will support that amendment .
it is high time a change was made .
nor do i think that it is right for us to use trade policy for our aid to developing countries .
the debate is closed .
the present proposal for a directive comes in response to these changes .
i would ask for your support in the vote .
but what is it all about ?
that 's great .
but in my view , free will can go a long way .
there has to be the will to make implementation a reality in all member states .
'
i really must thank the rapporteur both for her report and for taking this line .
i congratulate the rapporteur and welcome this common position .
mr president , there is one area in which the commission cannot accept the amendments presented .
the debate is closed .
next i would like to thank the council .
this is where action on employment will come from .
i would like to make four fundamental comments .
there is still no significant reduction in the number of areas .
i would also like to make just a few comments on the budget .
in real terms , what the council has in mind is a 4 % reduction .
my group will vote against this amendment .
that is now out of the question .
does it reduce unemployment ?
we need to pay far greater attention to this .
the other matter concerns information technology .
thus , given that we cannot express an opinion on behalf of the council but that we can at least make ourselves heard , i would like to say three things to the council .
mr president , i , too , would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
i do not think it is appropriate .
that is what the framework programme is for .
but so be it .
to me , this is also very important in view of environmental protection , particularly with regard to further developing rural areas .
it cannot be .
there are two very specific points i want to mention .
they are not always the same thing , but we need to have regard to this problem in our society .
it will soon be time for decisions to be taken .
i fully share this point of view .
i think this change is a move in the same direction as your concern .
the debate is closed .
commissioner , this time we really do want to see some action !
that is what we wanted , after all .
parliament can take the initiative ; at any rate , it can vote on it .
the commission is then free to take up this initiative .
nevertheless , it is a contribution .
i ask you : where is this money coming from ?
that is , in fact , the objective of this paper .
those who come after us will thank us for it .
the priorities of the current presidency are environment , jobs and crime .
we certainly know that this is an important contribution to both those priorities .
so , let us try for that .
of course not .
so i have little to say on this .
we talk about it but we do not use it .
the practical effects of our past proposals have been rather small .
what can be done ?
there are three essential points .
so we have problems in that regard .
nevertheless , there is still a great need and much scope for further action .
the debate is closed .
this impact is very difficult to measure .
this is not a solution .
nevertheless , these efforts alone are not enough .
however , the commission , more for technical than for political reasons , cannot adopt all of the proposed amendments .
indeed , the position of amendment no 4 on the text of the regulation should have been different and the commission could then adopt it because there is such an agreement .
the debate is closed .
that is what we will be working towards .
i welcome the resolution and can agree with much of it .
i do not agree with members on that .
it was a look back at a time of success .
there is another matter of great importance : we need transparency .
things did not turn out that way .
i agree with what he said about cooperation in the energy sector .
that is just not the case !
are there any comments ?
that will also be done .
( parliament approved the minutes )
you are quite right . it should not have happened .
that seems to me to be the most important point in political terms !
to that extent we have to make it very clear indeed that not one single decision has been taken .
thank you very much , mrs green . in response , let me say the following .
( parliament agreed to this proposal )
there is no way around it .
two : the european union is part of the peace process .
but we have no time for terrorism .
we want to give them our clear support .
that is a commitment which europe has and must take on .
that is something we cannot get out of .
just on whose behalf are they speaking ?
i find that extremely difficult .
but we also have to consider the problems of security and terrorism .
what can we do ?
this is what parliament can do , and i believe that it would be a good idea for it , too , to step up its action .
and now to the european parliament .
the important thing is whether we talk or whether we act .
we all know this .
let us use that economic power .
this will be difficult to achieve .
the conditions are , however , clear .
the debate is closed .
the peace process is important and needs proper resources .
the amendments of the committee on budgetary control are clear .
the committee on foreign affairs , security and defence policy has also considered this aspect .
that is quite right .
but perhaps we could see things in a more positive light .
what is its purpose ?
i think this is precisely one of the points on which the countries of the european union are agreed .
we think it is an excellent idea to have an overall view .
secondly , we have another problem i hope you will understand .
will the council accept my regulation ?
that is what we think .
'
tell me how to do that .
welcome
( applause )
well i do .
then we will take our decisions based on what you say then .
at the moment we cannot do so .
that is our opinion .
thank you , commissioner .
but it is an amendment by the committee on agriculture and rural development .
mr president , there is indeed a problem .
this must go to a vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we see the above rule as a fundamental rule for our parliament .
( applause )
we have already voted on a and it has been adopted .
that is absolutely unacceptable .
mrs green , you are right in the following sense : indeed we did vote on a and indeed the majority was for .
it is completely unacceptable practice .
that is , after all , what we want to know .
we cannot accept that .
that cannot be right .
i have the french text :
after the vote on the resolution
mr president , as the rapporteur may i perhaps say a few words about this important vote ?
what the commission will make of that is its business , whether or not we agree to this .
fair enough , you can request it .
then we will know where we stand .
as a result , we have heard one for and one against .
mr president , we do not agree with that .
( applause from the left ) - after the vote
i therefore think that you must put the text to a final vote , one which could not take place earlier .
that is an end to the matter .
however , there should only be the one system , meeting both environmental and social requirements .
additional support measures to balance this are clearly necessary .
it is for this reason that i support the committee on agriculture 's position and this is why i voted in favour of its tabled amendments .
what are we to think ?
in fact , we already have a directive .
in think decisions concerning energy policy should be taken at national level .
i am therefore voting against this report .
situation in kosovo
as far as that is concerned , this will not be the last debate we are having here about kosovo .
despite their effort , it is not enough .
by we , i mean the european union .
and we know it .
that is our problem .
it is a fact .
we must get this through , it is a really crucial point .
however , i wish to make three points .
that is the first issue .
in this context , ladies and gentlemen , i have two serious difficulties with our joint resolution .
that is my first important point .
my second point is the fact that all too little is being said about the most essential aspect of the problem .
today we are discussing the future of kosovo .
i would , however , ask you to understand that the commission also has to work in difficult conditions .
let us simply note that fact and continue the debate .
mr president , there is a war going on in kosovo .
mr president , as this will be my last opportunity i would like first to congratulate the british presidency .
that is our main task .
that is the problem .
that is my first point .
we have to avoid that at all costs , if at all possible .
europe can do no more than that and it cannot go about it in any other way , because it does not have a political lead .
there is not one , it does not exist .
i have a number of specific questions for the council .
from kosovo .
why does he not want to see him ?
we must see things as they really are .
the debate is closed .
the council has taken up most of the amendments tabled by parliament at first reading .
this is very welcome , for this is a very important matter .
when the matter comes before parliament , therefore , we often have to reach our decisions very quickly if we want to make the internal market a reality for the citizens of europe .
this should also be taken into account in any future reform of the treaty .
today there have been other amendments which make it even better .
the debate is closed .
i think that we can but agree on this .
that is no longer acceptable .
the time is right to take a step forward .
this aspect is left out of the motion for a resolution .
tax policy is one of these areas .
this i fully support .
other areas must now follow .
question time ( council )
again , there is not much more i can add .
i am also concerned with these issues .
i would like to ask a more general question in connection with employment for women .
i believe that the important thing is to get job creation into context .
that in itself is a very important decision that must be taken .
1 )
he made that very point on behalf of the council .
common standards are required and perhaps it is time for the european parliament to take the lead .
however , if you wish to reply in any way , you have the floor .
first i want to thank the president-in-office of the council for the information he has provided in response to the question .
we have been working together for six months , and i hope we can do so again in the future .
the situation of democracy and human rights in turkey remains high on the council 's agenda .
certainly there are no conclusions which lead to any change in the situation .
i thank the honourable member for her further question .
i am very clear on the matter .
i thank the president-in-office for his very full answer .
could i thank the president-in-office for his very full answer .
i say to the honourable member who raised this question that she has raised a real point .
what action does the council think the eu should take ?
the honourable member is absolutely right to bring that to the council 's attention .
i hope we may be able to meet there , too .
we will take note of this .
that is what we have seen in recent years .
it is one of the reasons for the high unemployment rate in europe .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
in conclusion , i have one more question for the commissioner .
it will not stop at coordination .
this is unacceptable !
we must find the right balance between policy coordination and competition .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work .
however , i would like to talk about three things that are not included , and which i think should perhaps have been included .
i would like to look at this matter more in terms of principle .
to my mind , there is a matter of principle involved in these problem areas .
here , too , we need to keep in step .
let me state here and now that this has not been the case thus far .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is a small step in that direction .
we will therefore support the proposal .
as far as amendments nos 1 and 2 are concerned , i fully agree on the content .
again i congratulate the rapporteur and thank you , mr president .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
two points are of great concern to me , and they are the subject of amendments that the rapporteur has received .
in addition , the development of this system may create a large number of jobs .
in this context , i would like to make two points .
the commission does not have a vote there .
mr president , first of all let me express our thanks to the rapporteur .
we agree on that .
it is one of the list i have already given you .
or would you like me to do that ?
rather the other way around !
it is this positive policy which has allowed us to make good progress in this area so far and i would like to take this opportunity to thank parliament for its support .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
transport of nuclear waste
the next item is the statement by the commission on transport of nuclear waste in the european union .
you have said that there is no risk .
that is not quite true .
so there is a real risk .
so now let me put the question to you , mr commissioner . you must know something !
you discuss transport matters .
i welcome this statement from the commissioner .
i think not .
just look at all the questions we ask in the present joint resolution .
we would really like a response from the commission on these matters .
that is my first point .
mr president , the question of the safety of europe 's citizens in relation to nuclear waste transport is obviously of great importance .
it is important .
can i say something that i hope the commission will take note of .
the research goes on , but we have yet to find a solution .
and that is just the point !
finally it might just see the light .
these aspects must clearly be the subject of further measures , in particular at a national level .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this is what i am able to tell you today .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
the next item is the joint debate on :
it is not .
in addition , there must be economic reform in the european union .
first of all , employment .
this is the beginning of the reform process .
that is in the interests of all institutions .
that is a major step forward .
but i am well aware there remains a very long way to go .
we need economic and political reform .
i believe this is the coming debate in europe .
i thank you very much for that .
we have heard many of those words here .
( applause )
mr president , mr president of the council , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen .
europe should be given a face .
europe is back .
well , everyone is against that .
i welcome this .
( applause )
only time will tell if they will be successful .
agenda 2000 is indeed of fundamental importance for the future development of the union .
it not only has consequences for present member states but also for the whole process of enlargement .
we should try and do something about that , both at national and at a european level .
to us this means an important result in the british presidency .
mr president , i too would like to add my words of welcome to the president of the council to our parliament .
i certainly believe that the creation of jobs and the development of economic growth throughout the european union must be our number one priority .
( applause )
what they are trying to tell us is clear .
that is why we need more rights for this parliament , that is so say more majority decisions at european level .
that now should be a political priority .
let us be clear .
it means making sure that the model is relevant to the needs of today .
i could go on .
it is either the commission , or the european parliament , it is never the council !
there were no reasons for this .
it is true , the british presidency has done a good job .
if you say that coordination is necessary , encourage it .
then , make europe more effective , this is what the citizens expect of europe .
how do we make it more effective ?
finally , you want the citizens to have a say in the matter .
this is no doubt a good thing for europe .
i think much more progress could have been possible in this area .
i shall deal with the comments that were made on the european court of justice .
i would also like to welcome the comments that mrs green made about the terms and conditions of employment of european members of parliament .
i should like to deal with the comments made by several members .
i believe that was the right policy .
i do not believe that is the way to go .
they left the labour party .
that is not my idea of democracy .
( applause ) finally i would like to deal with the points that were made on agenda 2000 as well as several of the other specific issues .
the agricultural council in may agreed on changes to the common agricultural policy .
it is difficult and it will take time .
most certainly i do .
i agree with you .
could we take the vote on my group 's amendments first ?
i hear what you say but i cannot do that .
this is the crucial issue .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we have the same problem .
it must be said that i was there , and all the groups that were there agreed .
mr president , my point of order is on a different matter .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
mr president , i should like to ask the commission for its position on the amendments .
( parliament decided to refer the matter back to committee )
our vote is based on the following principles :
i have voted in favour of the report .
the first two objectives are quite different from the third .
objective 3 is of an entirely different nature .
a reform of the structural funds is essential .
a major contribution to this has been the structural funds programme .
'
we agree entirely with this .
this is not our position .
finally a comment on the british presidency .
let us face it , not a lot .
i have , therefore , voted against it in the final vote .
the reason for this is that i do not regard its direction to be the right one .
i have voted against amendment no 2 for the above reasons .
the commission 's proposal and report are in the main good .
i would like to support the conclusions of the rapporteur .
however , more needs to be done .
so much is clear .
they have to accept that .
welcome , madam !
mr president , i was just about to say the same thing .
we should make the most of this new opportunity .
the joint debate is closed .
we should support this as a parliament and you too , madam commissioner , should support it on behalf of the commission .
we should put that right because all of us want to see an end to the conflict .
the commission is prepared to offer humanitarian aid , if required .
the joint debate is closed .
i think it is important .
it is a specific initiative .
there is a majority in favour within the international community .
i call upon the house to support this resolution .
more is , of course , needed .
we have to welcome some of the positive things that have happened in recent times .
that is the objective of this resolution and the reason we demand action by the commission and the council .
this time there is a different reason .
at the same time some aspects always come together .
so we face a serious situation .
i want , though , to bring this right back home .
but what also matters is that the european union should be able to help in this crisis .
ladies and gentlemen , i will try to reply to the questions you raised .
the commission is most concerned about the way the situation has developed in this country .
the commission is following with some concern developments in the human rights situation in that country .
the joint debate is closed .
we do not understand why the majority of this house do not share our view on two points .
the court must be independent and effective : this is the task and the commitment of the union .
the task is difficult because no text has been agreed on .
the joint debate is closed .
nevertheless , i hope the result will be a good one .
the joint debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
is it really the eu 's task to deal with such matters ?
we therefore vote against this report .
i also wish to say that i will be voting in favour of the motion .
in conclusion , then , all of us must think things over once again .
how can we protect european development aid policies ?
i have serious problems with all of this , and think we are taking the wrong approach .
this is why i support the resolution proposed .
situation in kosovo
military action can only be possible after a decision in the un security council .
yet again this house has adopted a resolution on kosovo .
it would even have been possible to go much further .
that is all .
we have therefore voted against the whole of this resolution .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i hope we can make clear to the public the reasons for our decision today .
i am in agreement with these two basic principles .
that is one point .
production is not possible without this .
in other areas of fishing there is an urgent need for action .
the report has made this clear .
however , we have to change our priorities .
mr president , we are dealing with three excellent reports here .
so we really have to bring these things together .
this form of regulation is also of fundamental importance for two other reasons .
we should give it our support .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
these are very important aspects .
we must encourage quality policies .
in this respect , the role which the market can play is particularly important .
the committee on fisheries heard an account of this just a few months ago .
what role does the commission see for itself in this area , or is it going to be the member states ' responsibility ?
i have nothing really to add to that .
they are not available in the european union .
where does responsibility , or rather the own initiative of those involved , begin and end ?
i will not take long , because it is in fact a very good report .
this is also something we should be aware of .
that is a point parliament will also have to think about .
we can and must be able to control it .
because in the fishing industry that is how things always are ; as soon as you open a debate on a particular issue , we have to say a little something about everything .
take the subject of funds , for example .
to me , there is nothing new in this .
i do not really need help here .
so , there you have the guidelines .
the member states can do this themselves but it must take place on the basis of a proposal from the european union itself .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
what are these technical measures ?
but what does the rapporteur propose ?
one moment !
we cannot hear if you are all talking at once .
for this reason i request that it be adopted by the commission .
commissioner , i thank you for being here for this debate .
i would like to ask you to look at and adopt the tabled amendments relating to the following .
this measure should make an effective contribution to market regulation .
so does the commission .
thus , in these five central points of reform , the commission and parliament agree in principle .
some amendments refer to the principles of the future reform in the year 2001 .
i agree that such a reform is necessary .
the commission has made it clear that it has an open mind on this question .
some amendments concern the current financial year .
as far as the general legal provisions of the council are concerned , i agree in principle .
from my point of view , these do not have to be considered .
thank you for your attention .
the debate is closed .
we still have not voted on the legislative proposal .
and before that step , i would like to put a question to the commissioner .
i would like to know the commission 's position in relation to these questions .
but i refer to what i said in my earlier contribution .
all of this was true and therefore we did support you .
we had a vote without a report ; we voted on all the amendments .
i do not see what you can refer back to committee !
( parliament approved the proposal )
we are giving up markets .
our group has tabled two amendments to your proposal .
mr president , i would like to make two points .
for this reason i find it important that we take a vote on this .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( applause )
( parliament approved the request )
( parliament approved the request )
i will put this request to the vote .
information society
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
today we have provided them with additional work .
it is five minutes into its new programme .
i hope we may be able to get a statement from the commission .
are there any comments ?
thank you .
mr president , i am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak .
this , of course , could not have been done earlier .
( the minutes were approved )
welcome
furthermore , before the specific case at hand , the court set out a number of principles of which the commission must take account as regards the implementation of the budget .
but it is up to the legislative authority to make a special effort in this respect .
this will be done .
it has made a number of proposals which , unfortunately , have not been agreed between the council and parliament .
discussions at a technical level are going on among the institutions .
but the commission is not above the law .
i agree with this statement .
there are two questions here which are very important .
can you give us a guarantee of that ?
mr president , we need three parties to the agreement : the commission , parliament and the council .
what kind of a situation do we have here ?
we must follow that decision now .
but we must review everything .
so we cannot continue as if the decision had not happened .
we must be extremely clear about this .
this time that did not happen .
the court has said we do not have to pay the money back .
of course we accept that the commission must respect the law .
since it has the power of initiative , how do you see the commission 's responsibility in this matter ?
i would like to know what you think about this , commissioner .
you are right when you say that .
that is why we must take it seriously .
the council has not accepted .
but now we need a solution .
the problem is that the court did not accept it .
we need to get them through .
we need a strong political will and strong coordination in the council to get them all through .
the commissioner is under a lot of pressure today and parliament has expressed a significant amount of concern .
internal actions will need the same .
we cannot have it any other way .
commissioner , we would like your support .
i fully agree .
secondly , what will the european commission be doing about the programmes approved in the 1998 budget ?
we work on this basis .
so that basis does not exist .
this matter is closed .
it is now time for parliament to make a statement on this issue .
mr president , firstly , i should like to thank the rapporteur for her work , and also for her comments here today .
i think that this can , and must , be a model for the future .
this is not acceptable !
this aspect is , in my opinion , very important .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i do not yet see a clear answer from the commission .
clearly , a large part of the task must be for the local , regional and national authorities to deal with .
i do not really have time to discuss them here , although i would like to go through each and every one of them , but i stress their importance .
this is simply not good enough .
we know that a very major share of the european budget goes to agriculture .
both were left out of the treaty .
i think not .
but even then , you would need to have a very good idea of what would and would not be possible on a european level .
just think of the internal market , transport systems and agricultural policy .
and how should we deal with this ?
but will this be enough ?
this is an excellent initiative .
mr president , the commission must also be well aware of this and take account of this in its proposals for reform of the common agricultural policy .
i should like to make three points .
in my opinion , priority must be given to the following .
nevertheless , they can and they must do their job .
the 5 % proposal requires far more serious consideration .
they also mention funding .
let us take brussels , for example .
finally , i come to the important question of local government and local power .
the debate is closed .
one comment on the legal basis .
unfortunately , we have not received any institutional reply to this question so far .
however , we wish to stress that everything possible must be done to guarantee that these particular programmes , which call for a high level of commitment by member states , are made relevant to our citizens .
i cannot , therefore , agree to the creation of a budget line at present .
finally , i have another point about expenditure under the common foreign and security policy .
whether the council is prepared to accept it is another matter .
it is clear that this is not yet the case in other countries .
but the general fund that has finally been decided on has been agreed with the committee on agriculture .
we have some hope , but no more than that !
the debate is closed .
we want to ensure that community funding is made available for this .
the european commission report is clear .
the one hand does not know what the other is doing .
who will benefit ?
it is important that we take these up and implement them .
since i only have two minutes , i will simply deal with one single aspect of this problem .
perhaps there is still time to step back .
the consumer ?
no doubt all of them will to some extent .
the debate is closed .
these , madam president , are the objectives .
will it all work in practice ?
it is , therefore , in this context that the amendments tabled by your parliament should be considered .
the debate is closed .
this is the question concerning us in this debate .
allow me to put forward some key points .
there is much to be done .
france has done so already .
better information is , therefore , required .
here , too , better information is required .
the european parliament has a large role to play in this .
in short , we must set a good example in europe .
what is it all about ?
however , it is not only our citizens who know very little about this .
the debate is closed .
that is the real problem .
that is how it really is .
without such standards we will not make any further progress on this issue .
developments are going in the right direction .
it is quite clear that we all want to put a stop to this .
it is something which we all must work towards .
however , many of the problems in the new environment do not call for new legislation .
concerning the amendments , the commission is able to support most amendments tabled by parliament .
the commission is , however , working on a legal instrument , a proposal for a directive , to deal with this subject .
i again thank parliament for its work and its response so far .
in line with this , now is the time to follow up on the initiatives of the european union institutions .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
i ask also that the social partners make a first move , because it concerns them .
in any case , the eu must never be just an economic and monetary union .
it must move towards a social union at the same time .
however , there is a problem in that little progress has been made in the social dialogue .
we consider that the effect of this initiative is not to close , but rather to open a debate or bring it up to date .
we want strong development in this sector .
i think that this communication from the commission is a good first step in all of this and therefore i welcome it .
so this is a good start .
we agree that there is a great deal to be done .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we are not , therefore , sitting back and doing nothing .
the debate is closed .
working time directive
we are aware that a directive alone is not enough .
that is why we can no longer accept this situation .
so , we have to know who are involved .
we can see this more especially in the road transport sector , with serious consequences for the health of workers and for road safety .
we look forward to a directive next year .
i think that it is very important that the fishing sector should follow what has taken place in other sectors .
those are my main points .
we propose to do that .
i would like to thank you on their behalf for your support today .
the debate is closed .
fair trade
however , we still have a few problems .
but we believe that , for the european union , this can mean a different form of development .
i can but agree with that . but it is not enough .
currently , that is not possible today .
the people currently working with fair trade understand the problems .
in this form the report is a good idea .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken at voting time .
i would take the opportunity to do this now on behalf of the house .
if we only add something to the text , it will not make sense .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
madam president , there is one amendment to this report and it is a crucial amendment .
from my amendment we then take points 1 , 3 and 4 .
is it or is it not true that this remains ?
in other words , that this remains the way it was in the text of the report ?
is that what her amendment is ?
is that how it is ?
then we are in total agreement .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i think there are four particularly important aspects to this agreement :
i would like , therefore , to support the community action plan which is put before us today .
in fact , we have to take into consideration a basic fact about information technology .
it is urgent !
very urgent !
this has to be done at local level .
i would also like to express my support for the quality of his report .
it is therefore important to take account of this fact in our discussion and in our political action .
we need better coordination between the european institutions , more particularly between the commission and the member states .
" .
) .
at the same time we also need economic and social initiatives .
then there is the social and very current reason which concerns employment in this sector .
those are enough reasons for our party to vote against this report .
we might ask what will be left for the member states ?
to me , the answer is a clear no .
it seems to me , therefore , that we have to go further than the current resolution .
i am voting against this report for many reasons .
you never know !
i would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on the work he has presented .
one way might be to also include these rights in the treaty at european level .
social europe has indeed still a long way to go .
this is true in such essential social areas as training , education and solidarity .
it is up to our ministers to speak out on this matter and to act !
training work has become very important in our society .
road transport is one of the most important sectors .
europe is not working !
that is the reason why i am voting for this report .
we have to move away from this .
i am certain that the european parliament will follow .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the following amendments have been proposed :
that is not possible today .
perhaps we will have this opportunity once again .
do you wish to speak for or against ?
i am against this .
( parliament approved the proposal )
mrs green has the floor , to speak against .
that is our job .
i am going to put the matter to the vote .
( parliament approved the proposal )
that is not what matters now .
i will give you further information about this .
this should be done this week .
urgent procedure should not be used for less urgent matters .
mr president , on a point of order .
( applause )
mr president , on a point of order .
if the commission does not want to reply today , it has until tomorrow to do so .
it is fully within its rights .
what are we trying to achieve with this convention ?
i now want to talk about some of the measures proposed in this convention , because i think they make this objective more difficult to achieve .
i really do not see how that could be achieved .
mr president , my question is : where does the council of ministers stand with regard to immigration policy ?
but that is not sufficient .
for a start , we need a common strategy on european immigration policy .
but the question remains : where does the council stand ?
i ask you to show such solidarity .
the first point is the principle , the second the rules of implementation .
i would like to live in a democracy .
this is also a type of development aid .
what we need is rules relating to employment and also to the immigration of foreign workers into the union .
i consider this to be an absolutely essential system .
is that not wrong ?
i hope it will be supported , of course .
i deal with many of their problems .
this is often the case , by the way .
i would like to ask , however , what is actually at issue here .
so what is going on ?
why do we have it ?
you know this as well as i do from experience at local authority level .
the citizens also expect the european union and its institutions to help .
but we still have different rules .
however , the question is how far we should go .
i do not agree with that .
the debate is closed .
it is important to establish this .
what is included within the scope of this report ?
if they do , we could do without a parliamentary resolution .
why not ?
why do we not deal with this subject as a whole ?
it is very important that we look at this question when it comes up in the house .
because of the time i have available , i would like to mention a few specific points which i do not think are very clear in the report .
mr president , firstly i should like to put a question to you .
i agree we must stand together to fight terrorism .
the debate is closed .
that should continue to be the case .
in the end it is only in this way that policies can be accepted .
the projects are on the way to being implemented .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
i think in almost every case that has been the result .
mr president , let me first of all say to the commissioner , that his action plan is very welcome to me as a member of this parliament .
this applies especially to third countries , where the circumstances are often quite different .
this is the key to the unemployment problem .
i believe that training is one of the most important instruments here .
the time is up , i think .
i share the rapporteur 's concern that the commission communication does not provide a specific plan of action .
this sector is vital to employment and production in the european union .
i welcome the commission 's plan of action in this area because i believe it is a very important sector for europe .
however , there should be no doubt at all about the objective , that is to say free trade and competition on equal terms .
now we must find the means to do something about it .
many of my colleagues have said as much .
this is an industry with a future .
we must consider the consequences and provide the means .
mr president , i first want to congratulate the rapporteur .
i would add that that applies not just within the european union , but also in our relations with third parties .
we have cohesion and structural policies in the union .
secondly , access to international markets .
on this point at least we are in agreement .
we also agree on the content of the plan of action .
the regional fund has already been mentioned .
( de ) let us try again , let us have another go . but now let us discuss things we are already doing .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but , just for the moment , let us go back to the treaty on european union .
why not ?
this is why my group has tabled three amendments .
this must not happen .
given what i have just said , the european parliament 's lack of serious powers in this area is of very little importance .
the eu must adopt a new approach to policy coordination .
i therefore think that the problems of employment policy , economic policy and financial policy actually have to be seen as a whole .
in fact , the real debate should not be about that at all .
instead , the real debate should focus more on the nature of the committee .
it is not only the commission and parliament who have such power .
unfortunately , this has not happened .
the debate is closed .
mr president , european economic interest groups : what are they ?
of the amendments , i can support nos 1 , 3 and 4 but am against no 2 .
if europe is going to be something more than just an internal market and achieve its hope for economic and social cohesion , it must develop services for the benefit of all at european level .
perhaps the commissioner could give me some information about this .
the debate is closed .
what does this mean ?
but it needs to be done .
there is no question that it will be a very different europe from today .
the opinion of the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights is based on this principle .
i am too .
i am pleased to see that the house is prepared to do this .
( parliament decided to refer the report back to committee )
i thank the commissioner .
for these reasons i will be voting against the report .
unfortunately , the report does not do this .
that is the wrong approach .
if violence is the main issue , then that is what should be discussed .
these are some of the fundamental reasons why we are voting against this report .
that is also the case here .
this is of course an old issue .
the second development is also important , however .
on a report like this it is necessary to get a very large majority in order for parliament to speak with authority .
now two more fundamental issues .
i myself am entirely in favour of that principle .
if we do not try to get these reforms going , who will ?
this is why my group has put forward a number of amendments which we would bring to the attention of the rapporteur .
the amendments i have tabled refer to this .
that seems the right way to me .
i think a different way is best .
for example , the proposal that a candidate from the european parties should stand for president of the commission .
they cannot therefore play a true democratic role .
why so ?
perhaps other large countries would benefit more than france in this matter .
i do not know .
at all events , i will tell my french colleagues that this proposal is not in the interest of our country .
i said that this was an important moment for the following reasons , ladies and gentlemen .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur 's task has been a difficult one .
this report does that .
but others have not .
it does not exist !
this is unacceptable .
with this text , we are coming to an agreement about what we are , namely representatives of the people in a community of united states .
as from tomorrow , it is the council 's turn .
there is only national democracy .
i would just like to make four points .
it is not a matter for us , but we must draw attention to it .
this issue is very important .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the training and education of young people is an essential matter .
in the first place , council is making too small a budget available .
actually , parliament 's proposals have not been taken into account .
but this programme must go on .
the programme could be a significant first step in that .
we in the green group are of course going to vote for the report .
a positive point , certainly , is that the programme is open to third countries .
it has taken a long time but at last we have reached a conclusion .
mr president , the eu must be there for young people too .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to make some general points before i present the amendments of the committee .
the commission said that it could not agree to the amendments because they were in the wrong place .
those were the amendments put forward by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
in my opinion , this has no place in this directive .
it is true that the parliament has put forward a number of amendments and the council has now adopted some of them .
on behalf of my group , i can say that we are in agreement with the common position .
for this reason , my group and i are able to vote for the common position in its current form .
once again , i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this directive .
there are a number of others which are not mentioned .
these are the three criteria .
we simply cannot do this !
this is where any possible amendments should be made .
no , it was discussed in committee but there is no amendment .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
mr president , this is a very important question .
the commission 's services say he is on his way .
thank you very much , commissioner .
why ?
this must be our first concern , for this will help the private initiatives which want to carry out programmes of this kind .
if this takes place , the programmes will then , as i have said , be implemented .
if not , then the programmes cannot be carried out .
i therefore cannot answer a question .
you have the floor , for a question to the commissioner .
subject : own resources
mr president , i already have the answer to what i wanted to ask .
sufficient information will also be provided on that .
subject : implementation of democracy programmes
and finally , my last question to the commissioner is this : why did the council not adopt the motion that the commission obviously tabled as far back as a year ago ?
in the past there have sometimes been political difficulties .
we just hope that , at political level , the same will happen this week .
this budget line is one for which it is difficult to find a solution .
i hope that this reply will help the member .
there are member states that do it even better .
of course i will do what he says .
that says how much support we need for the proposed action plan .
the two honourable members will be pleased with one particular aspect .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
however , it did not say very much .
that is the first point .
i can answer two of those points .
i also wish to thank the commissioner for her reply .
but that is the most i can say .
i should like to thank the commissioner for her reply .
we are discussing this with the authorities .
therefore this is not a national issue , but a union issue .
it was just not good enough .
it was difficult at the start .
council only accepted three of our amendments , but things did improve .
then , finally , my thanks go to the commission .
naturally , the result is a compromise .
so what have we achieved ?
they cannot do it alone .
parliament has always taken the approach that the eu should take the lead in global , sustainable development .
overall , i think parliament should be pleased with its efforts .
what is the value of an action programme if it is not put into action ?
it is clear to all those involved with environmental issues that this programme can only be the beginning of sustainable development in the european union .
therefore , i can only mention a few key points relating to some of these .
there is no time to go through everything .
once again , i thank everyone involved .
that , also , is europe .
so far , so good , and i am very much in agreement with this .
this would certainly not happen .
this is of great importance to a sustainable future for europe .
there is really still a great deal of work to be done in this field .
the debate is closed .
parliament had long called for this .
this is amendment no 4 .
what will all this mean to our citizens ?
that is good for our citizens ; it is good for their health and it is good for their democratic rights too .
i thank you for you support .
the debate is closed .
women 's health
who would like to speak in support of it ?
there are , however , many amendments which we simply cannot allow in the report because they have nothing to do with the issue of women 's health .
thank you .
who would like to speak against this motion ?
( the matter was referred back to the committee responsible )
thus , this agenda item is closed , as the report was referred back to the committee .
i do not understand this discussion .
the members have voted , and the vote was very clear .
however , there was no policy , only a ' framework ' .
that is why joint measures are required to deal with them .
we have now received only a ' framework ' from the commission .
we want to stress how important this issue is .
research can be a great help here .
at the same time , community legislation must not be allowed to prevent this .
he made every effort with this report in the course of the procedure , and i believe that he has presented a good report .
she said that we could do new things which the state could provide for .
states which wish to use such instruments must be supported in this .
madam president , this is a good report .
then we would say that as from a specific date those member states who cannot achieve this using other instruments would be included .
one of the amendments presented by our group is concerned with this very subject .
for this we must see that our environment is in order .
the eu is not , and must not become , a state .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
welcome
ladies and gentlemen , we have that system !
enlargement has a cost .
it will remain on the agenda , and i regard that as a good thing .
i will go even further .
i know that the european parliament takes a very positive view of this .
the eu is far more than a regional power .
kosovo is a subject in its own right , so i shall say nothing here .
i know very well that six months is a short time .
this presidency is naturally something rather special for us , as it is our first .
but for us it is , of course , the first time .
we have therefore prepared ourselves well and we need the support of our partners in the council .
things are very different now .
that is our task .
( applause )
first , i will look at the issue of security .
i shall return to the subject of kosovo later .
my second point is enlargement , on which i have only a few words to say . here too , i would like to express my clear support for your comments .
i also wish to give my clear support to your comments on this subject .
we need a common foreign and security policy , and that can only be a european foreign and security policy .
and of course it goes without saying that we also need to make further progress with employment and economic policy .
it is not the only way , but we really need to make progress on employment policy now .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr president-in-office , we welcome your presidency .
your second urgent priority concerns agenda 2000 .
in this connection i would like to ask three questions .
your third urgent task is enlargement .
i hope that you will be able to achieve as many as possible of the things that you have presented today .
i would like to mention two points in particular .
the first is enlargement .
small countries have only legal stability and the treaty on their side .
this is what institutional reform should aim to achieve , and i hope that you , too , will accept responsibility in this area .
( applause )
the second point is the common foreign and security policy .
the last point and the most important concerns unemployment .
the proposal would make us the representatives of brussels in the member states .
my third example is institutional reform .
after that , time is up .
you should have been able to get all that done in amsterdam !
( applause ) but you did not get it done .
well , it is good that we are talking about it now .
' well , that is something at any rate .
i would like to stress that your own comment means that the european cause has to be taken seriously .
that applies to the foreign ministers as well .
( applause )
but that alone is not enough .
my colleagues and i in the european parliament will support you .
i welcome that .
i wish to put one issue to the president-in-office and to ask him one question .
i would like an answer from the president-in-office .
i do not expect these to be effective .
it is a very important task .
i am pleased that the subject of the coordination of economic and jobs policy is taken seriously by the presidency .
i would next like to say something about social dialogue .
we in parliament like to speak of the large european projects .
i believe that you have a key role to play here .
this needs to be done through cooperation between the council and the european parliament .
( applause )
i would like to make one more point .
there are three questions which interest me particularly in this respect .
however , my question is this : how can we make these reforms ?
who do we make them with ?
how do you achieve that ?
a social dialogue !
in other words , we need to talk with each other .
that means we need to know what is available to us before the decision on the budget .
and so it goes on !
now to the question of employment .
there must be absolutely no doubt about that .
then a discussion will begin within the union and the member states .
on the question of enlargement , i have said we want to start the negotiations .
the only country !
i would like to give you some clear information on human rights .
situation in kosovo
the next item is a statement by the president-in-office of the council on the situation in kosovo .
this is an important point .
welcome
everyone must know this .
after that , real negotiations about kosovo 's future can begin .
international law must be implemented to the full for kosovo .
finally , i have a few comments .
we say no , no and no !
madam president , i thank the president-in-office for his statement .
i have two concerns following the president-in-office 's statement .
in this context , i wish you every success in your task .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
i agree with you , mr president .
before the final vote
i consider this one of the most important , but also one of the most difficult reports which this parliament must deal with during this parliamentary term .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
welcome
we must vote on this !
( parliament adopted the resolution )
not even the proposals from the european parliament 's first reading remain to any great extent .
this is the reality of the matter .
however , i hope it will be possible to reach a compromise that is acceptable to all member states .
there is not .
we really have to look at this again .
it will not be in the interests of people , despite what you are trying to say here .
that is why i voted against this report .
not at all .
nevertheless , the process has been set in motion .
to what extent certain members of this committee were taken in , we do not know .
i would try to understand this , if i did not already understand only too well .
i hope so , but unfortunately i cannot say that i am sure this will be the case .
this is not my opinion .
these are the principles .
it is for this reason that i support the draft act which is before us .
under the current system that does not happen .
two of his main conclusions are unacceptable to us .
so i have voted in favour of the text .
as they were not all adopted , i have voted against this text .
it did not work !
to achieve justice , it did not work !
for this fundamental reason , i voted against the proposed resolution .
for these reasons we cannot vote for the report .
and over what period will this be ?
i would like to share with you three concerns , and put to you two questions .
we have a number of concerns with regard to this matter , as does the commission , i believe .
the most important concerns the instruments for monetary policy .
and we want to say so .
for this reason , we here are discussing the policy of the european central bank .
monetary policy must play its part here too .
nevertheless , i would like to draw your attention to a number of points .
but this changes when large countries are involved .
i would like to ask the president of the european central bank the following questions .
let us not get carried away by the fact that the euro has become established .
in this respect , mr president , i also have a number of questions to put to you which move in the same direction as those of some of my colleagues .
i would like to hear the president of the european central bank 's comments on this .
i cannot say more than that .
it is a difficult matter .
work on that is making progress .
some questions have been asked about that .
i cannot say anything more .
the debate is closed .
at the same time , a monitoring process was established at union level .
now it just needs to be put into practice .
the eu as a whole would do well to follow this example .
that is the whole problem , as far as the commission 's actions are concerned .
what can be done ?
i only mean this part .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report .
and to a large extent it will continue .
both parliament and the commission have shown concern .
moreover , you get out of it what you put in .
i think the report does justice to that .
that is difficult .
that would be out of the question .
this is the best way because it is what the animals are used to .
so there is really no point .
this is crucial !
that is as far as it goes .
that is not up for debate here .
now for the report itself .
we cannot accept the others .
as i said , i cannot go into all these amendments one after another .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
the question then is when this new proposal will come and how this issue is going to be discussed later on .
i would like to have a reply to this .
as you know , the commission has been called upon to act , but we have not as yet seen any proposals .
mr president , i wish to thank the president-in-office .
but he did not have the time because of the change in the presidency .
this document is not yet available .
it will also address the question of the content of these measures , but i cannot give an answer to this at the present stage .
this has not been done .
you all know you can ask me for the floor .
ladies and gentlemen , we are not going to turn this into a competition .
i have nothing further to add to this .
i would like a response on that point .
these are just some of the measures available .
i do not want to go on about this , of course , but i would like to put it to you that such measures are important .
firstly , you talk about a working document .
nor can i give you an answer as to its content , that is to say , whether additional funding will be available or not .
i think you should ask the commission about this .
that is my first point .
i would like to be quite specific : from which part of the european union budget will these funds be taken ?
mr president , on a point of order .
but it is not a point of order .
so , ladies and gentlemen , if you will allow me , as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
mr president , i thank the president-in-office , who is here today to give us a response .
i thank the president-in-office for her reply .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
that is one of the reasons why these questions are being put to you .
we have here a list of measures for which new legislation is being created .
thank you very much , madam president-in-office of the council .
thank you very much , mr president .
then the council can become involved too .
what is this about ?
why ?
there is nothing i can do about that .
what model should really be adopted as the best practice ?
that is the basis of the agreement .
we must ensure greater quality in our legislative work .
we now find ourselves in a new situation , the council must first of all get used to the fact that it no longer has the last word .
the present resolution does not do that ; it has taken the proper direction .
let us make a compromise .
therefore , i believe that we must all support that political objective .
that would be one example .
why ?
however , there are other reasons which i would like to point out here .
you do not need to answer , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
in the current state of affairs , we can unfortunately not do without it .
why has this happened ?
why do we have this result ?
i hope the commissioner can comment on that point .
i think that the issue is thus not a closed one .
i am very pleased about this , i welcome it and also congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
however , we will have to see .
what future would we see then ?
i cannot therefore vote for this report , nor can i vote for any of the amendments .
here we could open a discussion which might be able to get further than the amsterdam treaty 's current solution .
however , i would like to make one thing clear here .
we are going to do so .
it is not the only such case provided for in the treaty .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
action plan for the free movement of workers
all those concerned are to be involved in developing free movement . this means the citizens , national , regional and local authorities , the social partners , but of course the european institutions too .
the first concerns coordination of social security .
it is certainly more important for the future than at present .
here we created many legal conditions to allow this to take place .
i now welcome the action plan presented by the commission to improve freedom of movement for workers at least .
i welcome it because the commission presented very specific proposals here .
there are many positive points on which we are in agreement .
i believe you have taken on too much .
i agree with some of your proposals , but there are some important points with which i do not agree .
thank you .
nothing has been said about people .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent and open report on this issue .
i considered this to be only practical .
this must not be allowed .
unfortunately , the situation here is different .
we must keep this in mind , and this applies to the commission as well .
a great deal can be done about this .
it would only mean that we would remain in our present situation , while we really want to move forward .
that does not exist at this time .
the second concerns the question of employment policy .
the european parliament also called for such actions in its resolution .
in this context the resolution from the european parliament is very important .
they want to know how they can fully benefit from that .
i welcome the important contribution from the european parliament in this respect .
madam president , i have a question for the commissioner .
i am trying to deal with this in a proposal before the commission at this time .
the debate is closed .
you have the right to do so after all !
why in another country ?
this is why we need this directive .
what do we propose ?
already , at first reading , this may be a model for future cooperation between parliament and the council .
but i believe that it is not appropriate in this context .
madam president , i would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for his proposal , and also to congratulate him on it .
i thank the rapporteur once again for his work and i thank you for your attention .
madam president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this important report .
it is an important first too for parliament .
this is an important directive .
finally , madam president , i would like to say something about my amendment .
i am in favour of integration .
and why ?
in the interest of the citizens we must make more use of this right of initiative . i will not go into the content .
we should all be pleased with this .
we will therefore support them .
i now come to the second point which i wish to discuss .
the second reason is institutional .
i will now turn to the individual amendments .
the debate is closed .
it is they who are making demands .
that does not come of itself either .
we have a clear responsibility and a clear task , not least from the citizens of europe .
of these 12 , there are two which i can support .
yesterday we had a debate on financial instruments .
we must , nevertheless , continue to move forward .
it would improve the environment and create jobs .
the debate is closed .
are there any other comments on the minutes ?
i voted ' no ' on the first vote and ' no ' on the second vote .
( parliament approved the minutes . )
madam president , i would like to make a request to the presidency .
madam president , on a point of order .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i hope that the house will be able to support the report .
my report has been discussed a great deal .
the most important point in this context , however , is that democracy has to cost something .
that is an important objective .
this is what members really want to see .
i just wanted to point out to you that the council presidency is here today .
all this , however , is unfortunately not the case today .
this concerns us .
the council , the commission , the national authorities ?
what will happen after that ?
we must , therefore , be serious .
that is all i wanted to say to you .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
thank you for your attention .
i hope that the president will make a decision on this at the vote .
it means many things .
for example , the council must now ask itself whether it actually has the right to rule on what is and what is not legislation .
i share the opinion that we in the eu institutions must continue this information work .
it is a question of increasing the confidence of the citizens in this procedure .
mr president , i have a question for you .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place during the next voting time , which is about to begin .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
madam president , on a point of order .
is it not right and proper that we should continue ?
it is only right and proper that we should continue .
that is good .
with this in mind , i have voted in favour of the report .
these are some of the questions which we really have to ask .
what is the main purpose here ?
i ask myself whether this parliament should concern itself with such technical matters .
i am not certain that the directive is the proper instrument for this purpose .
no doubt we shall have to return to this problem at second reading .
first of all , it is a true institutional " first ' .
this is enough to show that the initiative is both necessary and urgent .
is it really necessary ?
moreover , he did the same kind of thing at the time of the last council meeting on the euro .
this is not the case , particularly in france .
) .
i have therefore voted against this report .
the same is true in the field of international relations .
so what do we do ?
europe must not only be a business community . it must be a europe of the people .
one of the reasons for this is that it is extremely difficult to move to a different country .
this must also be the case for employment policy .
with this in mind , i would like to support the resolution tabled here today .
we know that .
therefore , commission and council , do something !
this is the only way to allow democratic elections to take place .
the joint debate is closed .
the union must be prepared for dialogue .
however , we need to go a lot further .
measures must also be taken at the level of the council of europe .
clearly this is something we welcome .
we should think long and hard about that .
mr president , as i understand it the question is about what further action we will take .
i am not in a position to state specific conditions .
several amendments to this text have been tabled .
why ?
in this respect , too , the european union can and must play an important role .
that is the wish of the are group .
his call for a ban on new investment should be an example for us , commissioner .
this simply did not happen .
as we have not seen him during the past few months , i think it is important to point out that he is not here today either .
the european union must make a stand .
we can do more .
this has been going on for too long and we have to do something about it .
the problem has been the same for many years now .
let us do everything we can to ensure that these conditions are created .
that is the first step .
i can add nothing to this .
therefore , the united nations has called on the commission and the member states to provide as much humanitarian aid as possible .
in any case , we must support the peace process .
well , really !
this is important .
this is urgent .
that is my question .
i will ensure that you have a response to that .
many thanks , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
time is short .
the european union has the necessary means .
all that is needed is the decision which , in the circumstances , i am sure will be taken .
my colleagues have done that very well .
i would just like to say two words .
what remains for us to do ?
i am not going to be able to answer every question that has been raised .
i will , however , give you the information that i have .
many thanks , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is the point !
my group has nothing more to add to this , and we support this position completely .
during your speech i will refer to it myself .
' .
unfortunately , your statement is not enough .
mr president , i would like to comment on the previous vote .
it was for parliament to decide that .
i therefore congratulate her once again .
we do believe in it .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we shall meet again later as unfortunately is our lot .
i thank you , and in particular because it is the last time that you will be speaking in this house .
finally , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his clear report .
but , in conclusion , we are going to support this report .
of course , there can be various reasons for this .
however , there are a few amendments that we cannot accept .
we cannot accept amendment no 1 .
the debate is closed .
structural funds programmes to the end of 1999
if they do not do so , that programme cannot start on time .
it must .
i hope we will hear a clear commitment from the commissioner on this point .
we call on the commission to ensure that the new guidelines do precisely that .
i therefore believe that this issue is a priority .
regarding the next term for new programmes , this will mean agreement by the end of this year .
we can only achieve sustainable development , equal opportunities and employment if they are a joint aim .
we know that many member states do not want guidelines .
that is responsibility enough to make us develop them into a central instrument here .
i would ask the commission to take that point into consideration .
the same goes , for example , for the environment and sustainable development .
the debate is closed .
and although i cannot agree with one of the amendments put forward by the economic and social committee , it is on a point of form rather than one of content .
indeed , there is need for action .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
so my point was different .
that is my question to you .
i have taken note of that .
( the minutes were approved )
i have therefore voted against the report .
but the council still has a long way to go .
we must now go further , and do more , more quickly !
fight against crime
but that alone is not enough .
what is the objective of every criminal ?
in principle , we are united .
there will be investment in training .
this requires the protection of the individual .
the council has still not given its opinion on this proposal .
there is reason to come back to this , and the victims of crime should be involved in this context .
why ?
for that reason , as we have said , we fully agree with the rapporteur , and we congratulate him .
that is therefore the aim of this report .
european cooperation in the fight against the crime , in this particular area , is thus very important .
all these measures have our full support .
i am very concerned about this .
this is therefore something that i am against .
mr president , it is clear that this draft joint action is good .
how is it with this then ?
however , are we a good example in our own field ?
the debate is closed .
mr president , may i ask the rapporteur a question on this point ?
perhaps the rapporteur could give an opinion on this ?
there is no doubt about that .
and , since he does not wish to do so , we shall continue with the vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
as we heard from the president-in-office of the council in this house just two days ago , all this is to become reality .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i look for the support of the house for those amendments .
( applause )
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that is why the report was referred back to committee and , in fact , we did it for her own good , in her own interests .
that is what i wanted to her to know .
i will not go further into the report that is on the agenda .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
now to the more serious matter .
this is not about what each committee would like to do , but what it can do under the rules .
( the order of business was adopted )
he has really done a very good job .
we would make that change simply because we believe that the issue is already well provided for in an earlier part of the same amendment .
the debate is closed .
has this been achieved ?
i hope that everyone outside will be pleased with the work that has been done .
we have achieved progress and something positive here .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i doubt if i shall use all my five minutes of speaking time .
this is the line we think we should take .
three of the five amendments were not adopted by the commission at first reading .
as far as amendments nos 4 and 5 are concerned , we should like to express our thanks .
the debate is closed .
that is not so .
we have a framework for the development of our joint role .
let me be quite clear on this point : the eu has not given anything away here !
we shall naturally support it in this , so far as that is within our power .
the euro will also have its part to play .
perhaps the commissioner could make a statement to the council .
no doubt he will do so later .
but what might one actually say about them ?
and what of democracy ?
so there is a great deal that could be said on this subject .
and what of freedom ?
and why not ?
it was a priority question .
it is only right that the commission should answer these questions .
i said it at the beginning , but perhaps not everyone was here at the start .
we do not need to concern ourselves with that .
it does not mean that such a system may exist because there was one in the past , when it may have been set up for entirely different reasons .
we know nothing about this .
that is the first point .
this is something that is agreed between the member states and with us .
that is absolutely clear .
i cannot say anything more to you on the matter .
i cannot say that to the house , however .
there is no time , since we have only five minutes more .
the commissioner has the floor .
i must refer the honourable member to parliament 's own rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
he had nothing to say on the subject .
he did not know anything about it .
thank you .
are there any other comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
amendment of financial regulation
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in principle i can support the proposed amendment of the financial regulation .
the budget also has to be prepared for this .
we are very far from that situation .
it is absolutely urgent .
there is no problem , i will do so .
the debate is closed .
draft budget for 1999
i hope that our two institutions will be able to bring the 1999 budget procedure to a successful conclusion , just as they did for the 1998 budget .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your attention .
what does this budget tell us ?
indeed , we have already made technical proposals .
the second area i wish to address is external policy .
thank you , mr president-in-office .
i should like to thank parliament , but also the commission , for its cooperation in this matter .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your attention .
' yet ' is my word , because parliament has not yet voted on this report .
there were four areas .
there is certainly no doubt about that .
under current circumstances , however , that should not be too difficult .
( applause )
it can do nothing if it is not put under external pressure .
all in all , i consider this to have been a success .
i look forward to working in cooperation with the commission on this matter .
mr president , i think we still have some difficulties with this first part .
firstly the question of the legal basis .
we have to take a decision on the matter and we must not make too much it one way or another .
the problem , as i see it , is this .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am pleased that you welcome this agreement .
i do not agree that the council can only come to decisions - and in this case did come to a decision - when it is under pressure .
that is why it was a matter of concern for the council to find a solution .
it was also for these reasons , i believe , that it was high time to find a solution .
i will now reply to the questions put by honourable members .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
whether you like it or not , that is the reality !
today , we have the result .
that 's the way it should be !
in this way , we hope that the quality of the air will start to improve very soon after this decision has come into force .
it is quite clear they are able to do that .
this is the whole point .
that should not happen again .
i do believe , however , that we have taken a step forward .
for my part , i believe this is the best thing the european parliament has done in this area over the last four years .
we have achieved quite a lot in the last four years .
that will be a good basis for further agreements .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
so far , so good .
of course i hope that a few more members will be here in due course .
that is an important point , and we should all work to achieve a result .
thank you for your statement , commissioner .
this is not clear at the moment .
i actually believe that the environment committee 's motion for a resolution does not go far enough .
it really is high time to take action !
after all , our views are , to a large extent , the same .
they must say how and by what measures they propose to achieve them .
so we only have a basic level of agreement .
we have to make a start here ; we have to do something !
unfortunately , the procedure to be applied here is not clear .
we need to improve the situation and establish rules .
we must take some of them ourselves .
we do not have a great deal of time .
let me comment on some of the crucial questions which have been raised .
such a directive has been adopted in the commission and will soon be before parliament for consideration .
what we have not had are a few more decisions in this field .
mr president , i asked a question earlier , which i consider to be very important .
commissioner , i do not think you need to tell us what we already know .
what will the position of the environment council be on this ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
does this mean that we find the proposal sufficient ?
i am therefore against this amendment .
thank you , mr president .
this is a very difficult issue .
one of these , in particular , is extremely important .
that i understand .
we have problems with the directive we are now discussing .
why then has the commission based the directive on the wrong part of the treaty ?
the european people 's party have proposed a fundamental amendment which must mean that this is now going to be referred to the legal affairs committee .
so i think this is a good step .
i believe that the legal basis of this directive is wrong .
i too am of the opinion that the legal basis is not an appropriate one .
it is clear from this that we cannot accept a large number of the amendments .
that is not our view .
i would like to comment on some other amendments which we cannot accept .
we can accept these amendments either in principle or in part .
that is not the position .
mr president , there have been several comments which have more to do with the debate itself .
i will not go into those .
the debate is closed .
i have three further comments .
secondly i would stress that the matter is urgent .
this is an important issue .
this first step is very welcome .
we are taking a step in that direction today .
let me give you an example .
so what do we have to do ?
the debate is closed .
waste management
i certainly would agree with everything he has said so far .
there are many areas where action really needs to be taken by member states .
we are prepared to take action and we call upon others to do so too .
what are we going to do about it ?
the commission often says this is very difficult .
it will be very difficult .
mr president , i support the resolution before us today .
in my opinion , this is a good idea .
this situation cannot continue .
i would like to thank our rapporteur , who has really done an excellent job .
but how are we to achieve this ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
i am pleased to hear that the commission would like more information and i will certainly provide it .
subject : voting rights for eu citizens
you say the commission cannot take any action .
what results can it point to in the last three years ?
that is the objective .
at this stage , i do not know .
this has still not happened .
is that being discussed ?
that debate is , in fact , still open .
i would like to ask where is the european union ?
i do not believe that they were .
what is the commission going to do to ensure that the communication is presented as soon as possible ?
thank you for that information , commissioner .
that is why i believe that a communication of this type certainly does have a role to play .
others are of the opinion that something should nevertheless be done .
it nevertheless remains a member of the european union . on this point there is no doubt .
subject : coordination of eu countries ' economic policies
it is simply the markets which make an assessment on the basis of an economic situation .
what is a country 's budgetary policy ?
what is its monetary policy ?
how does the commission feel about these matters ?
here is a very practical question , of direct concern to our citizens .
this needs to be discussed .
the decisions have been taken , and today we are at the stage of implementation .
we have three years in which to do it and i believe that this is a task for each and every one of us .
why ?
first of all , because the euro has already had positive effects .
i believe we will have the opportunity to discuss this during tomorrow 's sitting .
firstly , transparency .
next , democratic control .
indeed , this is one of the key problems raised by this parliament .
that is the political point .
madam president , behind the technical aspects this is actually a question of power .
this is not what has happened at all .
and what do the rules say ?
and who takes the decision not to accept these proposals ?
not for anything .
there is a saying : ' you know me by my actions , not by my words ' .
this is the purpose of the amendment tabled on behalf of my group and i hope that it will be supported by the house .
we know the list from the budget , but we do not know every committee .
then only the commission can put a matter back on the agenda of the council of ministers .
it is crucial therefore that the council of ministers and parliament have a general right at all times to have a matter put on the agenda .
that is not sufficient for us .
that is also the purpose of the resolution with which our debate today will end .
there are three or four main reasons .
that is why we cannot accept this system .
it is not quite good enough .
let the other institutions understand .
that may well happen again .
the debate is closed .
amendments nos 3 and 4 were tabled for this reason .
firstly i should like to thank the rapporteur for all her hard work on this issue .
in the first draft from the commission there were considerable problems .
that is why , in this respect , i am for more rather than less monitoring .
so what is the aim of this text ?
what means are used ?
we now come to the amendments .
the debate is closed .
once again i thank the rapporteur .
the problem is that this report , in its current form , seems to have several objectives .
we must ask ourselves this fundamental question .
how is that ?
it was much more .
the debate is closed .
welcome
international financial crisis and political developments in russia
europe has specific interests .
that is why i consider today 's discussion with the european parliament to be especially important .
the whole international community is trying to understand the current situation and to help russia .
this is true in general terms and in more specific financial terms .
everyone is concerned about the social consequences which this crisis could have .
the only way forward , therefore , is through economic reforms .
secondly , in addition to the technical aid , certain cooperation actions may provide very significant results .
you can therefore see , ladies and gentlemen , that we are not short of projects .
there is no doubt that the future of russia will come to your attention again during the coming months .
i have not received a reply to that question .
the second point concerns institutions .
what does the european union say to that ?
that , of course , is unacceptable .
i have heard a thing or two in this connection .
is this crisis due to the reform policy ?
how can you have democracy without a state ?
mr president , there are two aspects of the world economy : the economy in practice and the economy on paper .
we believe that this is the role which the people of the world expect us to play .
this is the real situation .
reform in russia is not a technical problem : it is a political problem .
this is why i hope that russia can find its own way .
russia still has to put her house in order .
that was the purpose of our aid , and it will continue to be .
russia has yet to find her place in the world economic order .
the cause of our concern is clear .
what , then , should they do now ?
what ?
what we need to do is decide what action to take .
are we in favour of urgent action ?
but what we are talking about in this debate is what we should be doing about russia .
but there are three important points to consider .
we can only help .
all the eu can do at this point is to address the consequences of the situation .
what is the issue ?
that is all .
we need this .
we must make this an instrument of growth and stability .
mr president , i have just three questions concerning the current financial crisis .
the crisis is both a political and an economic one .
perhaps we even need an international security council .
that is not only in russia 's interest , but certainly in our interest too .
and this is precisely what we have seen .
much has been said about what specific action the european union itself might take at this stage .
too little has been done .
welcome
welcome to the house .
now , what will the effects of the current crisis be on the european economy ?
what will these effects be ?
why ?
this is essential .
the international financial organisations are doing their best .
we should firstly therefore look to ourselves and our countries .
so what is the solution ?
the commission must use these consequences .
they have a government .
so what is the most important thing for the european union to do ?
of course the council , like the commission , will make its proper contribution to this effort .
the debate is closed .
let me be clear .
colleagues , we are not having a debate on this matter .
the rules are very clear .
it has to go back to committee .
some of the amendments on the first proposal have now been taken up in the second commission proposal .
mr president , on a point of order .
thank you very much .
mr president , i would like to ask that this report be referred back to the committee responsible .
i move that the vote be taken now .
( parliament decided not to refer the report back to committee )
amendments nos 1 to 4 :
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it was an administrative problem .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
mr president , may i come back to your statement in reply to my previous question .
that , in fact , is why this request is being made .
that is the end of the matter .
nothing .
can we really speak of free movement if the rules apply to eu citizens only ?
the council has in fact adopted the amendments voted through at first reading .
mr president , i voted against this report both for legal reasons and on a matter of principle .
transparency first and last .
mr president , waste management is an extremely important matter for public health .
the common environmental policy is indeed necessary , but not sufficient in itself .
waste management is such an important economic and environmental issue that we must step up our efforts in this field .
it is the wrong approach .
i agree with many of the proposals , but this is not a matter for the eu or the european parliament .
therefore , i support the report .
that was to include consideration of the economic and political aspects - among them the democratic process and the human rights situation in turkey .
how do things look in practice ?
this application for accession is a demand for quality .
this report is no different , in terms of its approach , from the reports for the other countries .
as you know , the commission made it clear in its document on a european strategy for turkey that certain proposals could not be implemented without appropriate financial aid .
again , we could be working on those areas .
but she does not meet the criteria which have been set .
only then can we make progress along the road to turkey 's accession .
but the question remains : what is to be done ?
madam president , i feel that at this stage , we need to ask ourselves two basic questions .
there has been no progress concerning democratic principles nor in respect for human rights .
since i am to present the next report to the house , this cooperation was very important to me .
there are many different reasons for that , and we need not discuss them all today .
as for turkey , the issue must be made clear .
there is no need to go into all that again .
this is indeed what our rapporteur said , and he is quite right .
the third comment concerns our working party .
parliament nevertheless voted in favour , in order to show confidence in turkey .
what has turkey given in return for this confidence ?
very little .
let me take you back to the time when we took that difficult decision .
the debate is closed .
situation in kosovo
ladies and gentlemen , you will be dealing with all this when you come to speak , and i do not think that these are points of order .
i shall give her the floor in a moment .
i turn now to the second priority , the humanitarian situation .
each side must have the right , at least at the beginning , to set out all its major demands .
my third point is this .
mr president , madam president-in-office , commissioner , in principle i quite agree with the basic points you made .
i would like to know what these measures or proposals were and why the council did not take them .
it can never find its way to actually act .
as you said , the situation down there has to improve .
it has not been implemented yet .
this cannot be true !
but what does that mean ?
the situation has to improve !
that is not the case .
what must be done ?
pressure on those responsible has be increased .
we are not talking about a future plan here , but rather a plan that is being put into practice day after day .
but we should demand access by all possible means and under all possible circumstances .
madam president-in-office , commissioner , all we can do here is talk .
yet nothing was done for years .
that is quite clearly a war crime .
and it needs to be said .
next : who is responsible ?
that too has been said often enough .
these governments share the responsibility .
that needs to be said quite clearly !
i refer to kosovo .
in view of all that , i wish to put some specific questions to the council .
but dialogue is not enough .
what can be done ?
which line is europe following ?
we must not come out on one side or the other .
unfortunately i have to say the same of the security council .
that is not entirely true .
mr president , i regard this debate as extremely important .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
but there is no such request at present .
i thank the president-in-office for her reply .
that is what i have to say on the subject .
one of the main issues to be discussed there would , of course , be how to bring the violence to an end and what role the union could play there .
i should like to thank the president-in-office for her answer .
i must say that the matter you have just raised again is more or less what we have already discussed .
what is the council 's view ?
thank you for the answer , madam president-in-office .
that was one point .
we are all aware of the difficulties involved .
that has now been done .
that may give you some cause for concern .
i am not at all clear as to what you consider to be the right and the left of the house .
it is up to you .
mr president , i thank the president-in-office for her answer to the question .
of course i know that the security council resolutions to which you referred are most important here .
so i would ask you to put that question to the commission .
this will certainly offer another opportunity to call for even greater transparency .
does the minister think that we could go a little further and work towards a political approach to the situation ?
madam president-in-office , we are all concerned about nuclear safety .
subject : human rights in iraq
i thank the president-in-office for her reply .
let me add a few comments .
madam president-in-office , i have two quite specific questions .
that is why we need eu proposals to be put forward and implemented .
the debate is closed .
welcome
i welcome these young people to the european parliament .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the single currency is a fact .
i shall begin by going through the amendments .
it has never been implemented fully .
we shall certainly be voting for it .
that , however , is another matter .
what could we do in order to move a little more quickly ?
we will all support it , commissioner .
this committee is a very important instrument .
the joint debate is closed .
it is for this reason , above all others , that we will support this proposal .
finally , a completely different point .
therefore , we will support them .
i would like to encourage you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the total could be 20 % .
why ?
will it work ?
what is the view of the european parliament ?
i can only agree with him on that .
i particularly welcome the fact that it is not only large companies , but also governments and therefore also the eu that are to lead the way .
we have a great deal more to do in that area .
europe should take those opportunities and europe will take those opportunities .
there are two points in particular on which we take a different view from that of the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
mr president , first of all i have a point of order , which i consider to be important .
this is all i wanted to say .
i would also like to know why the european institutions are not included .
but that is not the end of the matter .
they must be prepared for the euro .
finally i have a question for the commissioner .
for these reasons , we should welcome a european initiative in this field , and particularly this draft directive .
there are , however , a few points i should like to make .
and what does this amount to ?
mr president , on a point of order .
you are the president .
you have to make sure that members speak for the time that is given to them .
i think that we are going in the right direction .
' .
i hope that this will change in future .
let me deal with each of those reports in turn .
first of all i want to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work .
i would again like to thank you for your support here .
developments in that area since then have been particularly positive , though i believe there is still much to be done .
in that context let me mention six specific initiatives which are either under way already , or will begin very soon .
the joint debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
madam president , this may not be a point of order , but i have a question i should like to put to you .
we can say that the proposal for a regulation is a step in the right direction .
we cannot stop now , we must keep going .
my thanks to the rapporteur .
i think it is a very important area .
that is especially true in development issues .
it must also be taken into account in all european union development aid measures in the future .
the european union cannot take away with one hand what it has given with the other .
we think that is the right approach .
that is agreed .
the debate is closed .
women : impact of unemployment
madam president , unemployment is the european union 's number one problem .
but it goes further than that !
i should like to thank my colleague for her work , and i think that the member states do have to be made more aware of this problem .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have made further progress in the fight against unemployment .
these concern women especially .
why ?
here is another great idea .
firstly , women 's unemployment .
but they also lead me to ask certain questions .
it is now for the member states to put them into practice .
i think we have to go further .
i hope that we can make better use of funds than we do now for programmes to promote equal opportunities .
in fact i agree with you on a number of points .
it is therefore a problem for society as a whole .
that is the central point .
firstly , they still do not receive the same pay for the same work .
so what needs to happen ?
i believe that this idea should be considered at a european level too .
we must put a stop to this .
what is the reason for this ?
i fully support what happened there .
i accept that fully .
that is an important step forward .
we are going to hear a lot more about that in our 1999 guidelines , which will be discussed here before too long .
it is not well done in the member states .
progress has been made on this important issue .
member states are clear about what they must do .
that has been achieved .
that is the point as regards equal opportunities .
the debate is closed .
one successful legislative initiative , proposed by the commission and on which parliament expressed its opinion , provided for a programme for the social economy sector .
mr president , i would also like to talk about this issue .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
it can be voted on as an addition and i would ask you to put it to the vote as such .
i also agree with you .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution ) joint motion for a resolution on the situation in russia
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we would then have to vote on this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
far from it .
resolution on the international financial crisis
resolution on political developments in russia
so what can be done ?
this is not the answer .
it will only change because of its people and how they vote .
administrative reform cannot be achieved without cooperation .
the european union has made considerable efforts here .
now it is turkey 's turn .
i simply cannot go along with this .
one thing is certain .
as for the humanitarian situation , the military conflict is obviously having a serious impact here .
that is all for now , mr president .
how many more will there be ?
but although these issues are important , i believe that they are not the most important .
what is more , is it a matter of european union foreign policy or that of one or two of its member states ?
not at all .
but there are always only a few who can support these resolutions .
i know that you do not want that either .
a great deal has already been said about this .
this is what we must try to achieve .
we cannot do anything more for them .
this seems to me to be what is new about the current situation .
my second point is this , mr president .
it is firstly up to them to find a solution to the problem through dialogue and negotiations .
obviously , issues of public order and security are some of the most vital political priorities .
the joint debate is closed .
what is the european union doing about all this ?
what is the european union doing about this ?
what is the european union doing about this ?
commissioner , do something , put proposals to the council and make it take action .
we have become used to it .
i believe that the house is in agreement on this .
i think that we should be in agreement on taking joint action on this .
the results are clear .
that is what this resolution is for .
the commission will have the right of initiative for this .
but what does this mean ?
that is why we have put this amendment down .
under no circumstances , as a matter of principle , can we accept this approach .
that is one example .
the joint debate is closed .
but i hope it will not stop there .
certainly not !
and , sometimes , of institutions .
first of all , of course , we should think of the victims and call for community aid .
it is a fair point , you are quite right .
why ?
let me however say a word about the commission too .
he did not do so .
the debate is closed .
i note what you say , and we shall see what comes of this report .
i would therefore ask you to change the text .
madam president , i should like to ask you something .
i would ask you to stop doing so .
i do not wish us to discuss the matter any further now .
it is not the first time that i have seen him do it .
we can now continue with our work .
madam president , i would ask for the attention of the house for a moment .
( parliament decided to continue voting )
madam president , we agree with the rapporteur .
but the house must understand what we mean , as i think the rapporteur does .
i do not believe that is the same .
but here it is a question of a clear individual right .
that is something different .
i should like to make that quite clear again .
madam president , thank you for having taken the vote , and i thank my colleagues for having adopted the report .
so what should we do ?
however , we believe that it must be left to the individual member states to decide what kind of social and labour market policy they wish to follow .
this is an important point .
we regard these economic consequences as unacceptable .
this report is therefore a step in the wrong direction .
the communication from the european commission is therefore a step in the right direction .
this is quite the wrong approach .
and i cannot go along with what is said in paragraph 12 .
thank you , madam president .
for the next european summit on employment , we should ask each member state to provide the following information :
2 .
3 .
in conclusion , i would like to make a general comment .
we voted first on the amendment .
we hope that you will too .
thank you .
i should like to deal with a few of the main points raised .
the debate is closed .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would firstly like to point out two amendments to the text .
however , the european union also has a great deal of responsibility in this area .
i would like to make a further comment .
this is the way we need to go , in the european structural funds too .
they are both very relevant .
the debate is closed .
fisheries monitoring
mr president , first of all i welcome this report we are discussing from the commission .
this must be put right .
that cannot be a good thing .
we do not have real common standards within the individual member states so that we know what is what .
in my opinion , and in the opinion of our group , it is a very good report .
this is not only our point of view ; in this , we agree fully with the rapporteur .
there are also specific problems in this area .
we are very much in support of the rapporteur 's demands but see a great need for further action , despite the considerable progress already made .
this is not a good basis .
mr president , i welcome the commission 's document .
often that is not made very clear .
she would like to have been here .
i am pleased to take the report .
that is the aim of the communication we are discussing here today .
it will not be enough simply to implement what has already been decided on .
they have been referred to but it is as well that i should mention them .
that is not done well .
we would like to think we could do something about that .
finally , there are some initiatives over and above this which have been considered .
something could be done there .
i would like to see that happen .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
are there any other comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
what is the rapporteur 's opinion ?
( parliament adopted the resolution )
?
in conclusion , i have tabled a number of amendments .
one further point .
i just wanted to make this clear .
they have supported every single agreement since then .
all in all , madam president , these are two excellent reports which should be approved by the house .
however we can and should do more , as part of both the fisheries agreements and our overall development policy .
indeed many member states ' authorities are not able to control their activities either .
there is one area where we could help third countries more .
we thank the house for its consideration .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i cannot vote in favour of this report .
there are no clear criteria which agreements have to meet .
so its representatives are in a better position to stand up for themselves and make their own deal .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i cannot vote in favour of this report .
thank you , mr president .
as you are aware , the proposal is currently under discussion in the european parliament .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , i have another technical question .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
( the order of business was adopted without amendment )
thank you for giving me the floor .
i have made a note of your priority question .
we will look into the matter and try to answer it as soon as possible .
i would like to ask why there is no mention of this in the report .
( applause )
there are two questions .
five minutes , mr president !
that was their decision .
i was asked to give you some speaking time so that you could state your case in the house .
that is their decision .
)
i look forward to the case being held .
' ) my question is : why is such legislation not more common across the european union ?
the debate is closed .
drugs
to a large extent , mr president , they have been .
i in turn would like to thank the rapporteur for her report .
that must never be allowed to happen .
how best do we get to them ?
this requires , in many cases , both a national and local approach .
i hope the commissioner will agree with what i have said and that we can expect a positive response from her .
what form should it take ?
action in three areas .
that is for the long term .
we would view any change in this objective as a reason for voting against the report .
you do not say !
you will agree with me that there is still a long way to go .
there is all that , and on all that the report says nothing .
this house is not prepared to face up to reality .
the european parliament does not want to know about all that .
no new views are put forward .
it seems to me that she can draw her conclusions from that .
we cannot and must not give up on these people .
i was against including this report on the agenda .
we just want them to accept that we may not all think the same way .
firstly , we are in favour of protection of the people of the european union .
both have the same problems .
that report was rightly referred back to committee .
this report can therefore be supported .
that is quite unacceptable !
that is a rather different matter .
this , unfortunately , is not so good although there are some good things in it .
the debate is closed .
we have not even been given a list of the cases .
we agree overall with the rapporteur 's assessment and proposals .
the debate is closed .
common fisheries policy : control system
that would be a just and acceptable common policy .
what are these ?
we need better information .
we have a great opportunity here .
that was a very important issue too .
that is what we have to try to achieve within the european union .
we must have a system that is seen to be fair .
we have taken 10 years to get a common policy .
now they are to be implemented .
in any case , parliament is going further than the commission 's proposal .
it is far from possible at present .
that is an important point .
the debate is closed .
on a point of order , mr president .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
a number of issues were raised .
this does not allow it .
confidence in the market is not enough .
it is the confidence of our citizens that is needed for the euro .
changes have to be made .
everyone is agreed on this .
which , it may be said , is not only necessary but positive .
we have no control over that .
the debate is closed .
we know that there is to be a major review of all of the legislation next year .
the debate is closed .
i should like to know a little more about that .
we shall certainly be voting in favour .
i have little time for either view .
the financial risk to four member states is far less great .
the issue in russia is more of a political crisis which has economic consequences .
we would have more than enough to discuss on that subject .
obviously , the eu 's own institutions have to lead the way here .
this proposal can also be adopted before the end of the year .
mr president , may i express my thanks to the commissioner for his review of the situation .
the debate is closed .
we therefore think that a solution should first be found to the problem of freedom of movement for third country citizens .
but you do not have that right outside parliament , not in germany either .
that says it all .
ladies and gentlemen , we are no longer in a democracy .
that is precisely what i wish to see .
might these be political ?
that is not our opinion .
today we are dealing with an essential point : cooperation in the fight against drugs .
this is not true .
for these reasons we voted against the report .
there is a drugs problem in ireland .
' .
the eu is just such a system .
that is the reason why our group voted for it .
but this is not the most important point .
i have always made this a priority .
this applies to about 20 cases .
the only way to achieve this is through transparency .
i would say to you very clearly : we must achieve total transparency .
but i will go further .
why ?
furthermore , a joint report of the institutions involved should be prepared as soon as possible .
even after amsterdam , the european parliament has no powers in this area .
or who should be ?
so it is not possible , mr president .
what does the president of the commission do in such a case ?
my speaking time is up .
i hope we shall meet again .
nor would it be accepted in my country as a whole .
mr president , it is clear it is an urgent problem .
in view of the very short time available , i wish to address myself to the president of the commission .
that is a very important point .
i hope we can come to a positive reply .
i hope that this is the case , in the interests of both our institutions .
i hope this will be done as soon as possible .
the responsible commissioner is no longer there either .
we believe it is right and important to do that .
over time , though , it has developed into a very good organisation , in my opinion .
the debate is closed .
mr president , allow me to begin by saying that this report is far more than just my own .
we do not know what parliament 's total resources are .
it is the comment about the legal services .
there was not time enough .
what happened ?
both needed his close attention .
the debate is closed .
this could be done before the second reading .
i wish to make four points .
i hope we may quickly have a result on that .
this is for several reasons . some issues cannot be taken up for legal reasons .
what is the commission going to do about it ?
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
subject : the impact of the crisis in russia on the country 's energy production and nuclear safety
in this way there could be a positive effect on the present difficult situation .
mr president , i wish to thank the commissioner for his reply .
this is the practice adopted by most member states and that approved by the commission .
do you share these concerns with me , commissioner ?
mr president , i agree completely .
the question is included in the council of ministers ' work programme .
the eu has a responsibility .
the commission and the eu as a whole have to deal with this .
thank you commissioner for your answer .
it is clearly not .
such systems do exist in the other member states .
i would simply like to thank the commissioner for his response .
it is not acceptable . the eu has to look at this .
have they no rights under eu law ?
it does not make any sense .
that is not acceptable .
i am prepared to be extremely open in discussing these issues but , so far , i still keep my opinion .
that is quite clear .
thank you , commissioner .
and we also said that we will try to find the best possible way to carry the matter forward .
i still do not understand those business criteria .
that is all .
for practical reasons it will be difficult to increase the use of this type of energy .
however , as you know , it is you in the european parliament together with the council who have the final say in budgetary matters .
but in addition we need political decisions .
that is something we hope all the member states will follow up and make use of .
what do you think ?
many thanks , both to you and to parliament 's services .
why was next to nothing then done ?
never again is this parliament 's aim .
i also have a number of questions for the commissioner .
never again !
after all , they should apply throughout the world . but that is the way it is .
on the matter itself , however , we entirely agree with him .
this is a key area for the european parliament to be involved in .
we need to ensure their safety .
things had reached a point where the european union just had to do something about it .
the union had to act .
the debate is closed .
and , above all , we need to have the cooperation of the governments , the international financial institutions and the private sector .
it is unacceptable !
this cannot be true !
let us be very clear .
let there be no doubt about my support for that .
i have three comments of a general nature to make on this .
that has also been mentioned .
mr president , there can be no doubt as to the need for a global transport strategy .
that is a good thing .
the debate is closed .
much more needs to be done in terms of public transport too .
we thank the rapporteur for his excellent report .
the debate is closed .
with the reform of the structural funds and the process of enlargement towards the east , this is a crucial time .
it is also important to job creation .
my question is this : what is the commission 's response to this development ?
mr president , my thanks to the commissioner for his answer .
i hope these negotiations will result in success .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( applause )
now is not the time to begin discussing the issue .
( the minutes were approved )
in that regard , with the council and the commission present , i wish to make a number of political points .
that is a step in the right direction .
regional cooperation , on the other hand , is an important step in the right direction .
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the presidency and the commission for the reports they have presented to us here today .
that is of vital importance .
i should like to hear the views of the council presidency on this point .
this is what we want to see .
but we must not get carried away .
i should like to make that quite clear .
we will continue our efforts , to the end of our presidency at the very least .
but i will say more about that during the next debate .
the debate is closed .
situation in kosovo
within the last few days , the presidency has also presented ' project home ' to its eu partners .
we can have an opinion on it , but it is only one of many .
i have nothing more to add to what the presidency has already expressed in very clear terms .
that is unacceptable !
enough is enough !
do something !
just as there has been a great deal of talk in this house and at the united nations , but we have not actually done anything .
mr president , there are a number of questions i should like to ask .
in the face of all this , what is the key question ?
the question is , who can make the decision ?
but then we have to actually do what we say .
that is why i do not believe any of you .
i do not believe you when you say that you want a solution !
then there will be change in kosovo .
but what are we going to do ?
mr president , i think it is time to draw a line under the situation in kosovo .
the security council must decide in the next few days on whether to take military action .
the people of kosovo cannot understand this , nor can our own citizens .
here today , we are doing just about the same thing .
nothing .
nothing .
nothing .
we all agree on that .
finally , i should like to address one more issue you raised .
mr president , i very much support what the presidency said , including the last comments .
we need to change this state of affairs , but as i said the time has now come for action , not words .
i want to make that position absolutely clear .
that is also something we should welcome .
( 2 ) ensure effective application of these provisions .
i also support the specific proposals of the commission :
why not ?
that is why i did not vote in favour of the report .
the rapporteur makes some extremely important points about this .
these were a great success .
that is why the commission communication and the report we are voting on today are of such interest .
it is essential also to guarantee the quality of that employment .
not everyone agreed with me but i still believe that .
own resources ( budget procedure )
the next item is the commission statement on own resources and the budget procedure .
it is an important report , not only because of its content , to which i will return , but also because of the point in time at which it is being presented .
article 10 of the own resources decision states that the text should be presented in 1999 .
i would , however , like to put them in context .
that is the first point .
something must be wrong with the system there .
they will find it hard .
( applause )
mr president , the question now is who is going to pay for eu enlargement ?
i thank the commission for its statement .
europe or the member states ?
why not talk about trade ?
that is what we should be discussing .
mr president , i just want to say one thing .
it is very important that the commission come forward at this particular time with a communication on resources .
that is the approach we will take .
that is one part of this whole report .
the decision was taken by the commission just before 12 .
of course we are against it .
that is one side , and that is clear .
secondly , we are in favour of transparency .
this has been the first public debate on the matter .
the debate is closed .
this cannot go on .
we believe in particular - i myself , like the green group - that a motion for a resolution is unacceptable for the following reasons .
some activities have already been developed at european union level .
i believe that the european union does have the resources to deal with this situation , more resources than we sometimes draw on .
that is something that should concern us .
these are difficult issues .
we must all play our part in dealing with this problem .
we have to be seen to act .
however , resources are needed .
it is something that we are all aware of and are working on .
that is why we must call upon solidarity from all other countries as well .
the debate is closed .
i think that is important . i should like to thank him for that .
i think we should ask for a report as soon as possible .
i am not saying that there are no problems .
we must draw attention to any problems in that area .
at the present time the concern is rather with economic developments taking place in that part of the world .
that is quite true . nevertheless it is one of the few specific things where europe as a whole can do something more .
i hope that the commission will say that it will take an initiative on this point .
i hope that with next year 's report we can say that things are better than they are at the present time .
i would like to comment on some of the key points .
and so we shall be .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
that is very kind of you .
that is true .
it is certainly not a state in any real sense of the word .
this is the position of the commission and the member states .
thank you very much for your reply , madam president-in-office .
that would be my response to your question .
a number of questions have in fact already been put to the president-in-office .
this is the position of the commission and the member states .
if so , from what areas , and why ?
secondly , this is not a new subject .
i have one question for the president-in-office .
that is precisely our procedure here .
mr president , i only have one question .
that is not in question .
i should like to take up the second part of the president-in-office 's answer .
is it a question for member states or is it an initiative that must be taken by the european union ?
thank you , madam president-in-office .
thanks to her once again .
that is the aim of amendment no 11 .
however , we are still concerned .
three years is not enough .
we need at least five years .
as well as that , funding is extremely important .
we need to increase the amount of funding .
we must now take the opportunity before us .
at the first reading the commission accepted four of parliament 's amendments .
however , the commission considered that the political compromise in the council was the best that was available at the time .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
in the short time i have available , i will focus on four of these amendments that are of particular importance to both the rapporteur and the committee on the environment .
firstly , i should naturally like to stress the issue of funding .
some progress has been made since the first reading .
we say that from a legal point of view .
the debate is closed .
activities in favour of consumers
we have to be able to say what is necessary .
i have some reason to believe that the council would accept some amendment of this order .
we look forward to their proposals , perhaps next week .
for us that is the crucial point .
we support the commission proposal .
so we consider it most important that key consumer organisations also benefit from these resources .
the consumers need these resources , because they have a great need for information .
consumers themselves have a major responsibility .
consumers first !
further developments in respect of consumer policy and health protection are provided for in the amsterdam treaty .
the debate is closed .
it is really my hope that this will form part of the work to create an area of peace , security and freedom which we have been talking about since the treaty of amsterdam .
as a result , i hope that the directive will be adopted and implemented very soon .
the debate is closed .
i think that is most important .
but it is more than that . in fact this directive is much more - if we take a serious look at it .
why ?
let us implement them !
the commission and the council have accepted the amendments adopted by parliament at first reading .
i too hope , as has been said already , that the council will adopt this amendment by the rapporteur .
here we have one !
the debate is closed .
so we have a crisis .
this is certainly true .
and this is particularly true in terms of the court of justice .
i think we must now take a serious look at the situation as regards the defence of the community justice system .
in the commission 's view , the proposed system should under no circumstances be approved in its present form .
and this is precisely the point here .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
we will look into that for you .
( the minutes were approved )
the second point is the following .
the research market changes very quickly and the results of research must also be put to use very quickly .
it should be an aspect of all financial aid that the eu makes available , including that given to research , obviously .
despite that , for the reasons given at first reading , the commission cannot accept them .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
an energy framework programme naturally has a great many consequences .
energy policy will play a crucial role in this .
but it is of course clear that a great deal must be done in this field .
enlargement is on the way .
this also means that the energy sector must play an important role in this respect .
i believe this is the right approach .
the programme is already under way .
we must not let go of our concerns about energy ; we must keep them in mind .
mr president , when we talk about energy , we are talking about a way of life and a policy of security .
is this our aim ?
we do not have time to debate this now , but i believe that it is clear .
that is just how things are .
what are the priorities ?
what will we do with existing nuclear waste ?
that would make a lot of sense .
it is my job to express our group 's position in this joint debate on energy .
it has our support .
we welcome the framework .
there are far more aspects to energy than just environmental aspects .
not all aspects of energy are included in this framework .
i hope the commissioner will do some work on this .
there are five reasons why we need to change our energy policy .
the environmental reasons are clear .
nuclear power is certainly not the solution .
the first concerns the legal basis .
i would like to comment further on two points .
however , in a programme to which all countries make a financial contribution , the money cannot only be used to carry out research and work on the safety of nuclear energy .
i think we must also provide significant support for the efforts made by countries no longer using nuclear energy to move away from this type of energy completely .
it does not allow us to bring about a change of direction in energy policy .
this requires effective measures in the areas of both energy production and use .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission will agree with many of the amendments you have tabled .
as far as enlargement is concerned , i completely agree that energy has an important part to play in the enlargement process .
at this point , however , let me make a comment about nuclear energy .
as you know , it is up to each country to decide whether to have nuclear energy or not .
as you have heard , the commission can accept most of the amendments tabled .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
welcome
in this respect , it is therefore essential to have an appropriate budget available .
i therefore think it is essential that we have parliamentary monitoring and greater transparency .
i would first like to congratulate our rapporteur .
i think , too , that we should be pleased with the fact that in its common position the council has taken over almost all the amendments adopted by our parliament at first reading .
i did not have the opportunity to speak earlier , and i want to do so now .
we do not want to create conflict , but we have every right to question each other .
the europe of citizens is , in many regards , the europe of consumers , and for this reason i shall also vote in favour of developing a sustainable food policy in the interest of consumers .
i therefore voted against the proposal .
it is an excellent objective , but is it enough in the long term ?
we are therefore voting against the report .
joint motion for a resolution on kosovo
we are very far away from this !
it is not the first resolution the european parliament has adopted .
but this is not enough .
i think that such an initiative would be common sense .
this must also be an urgent task for the council .
we believe the decisions must be made at european level .
madam president , she was 20 years old .
what have we done over recent years ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but there is a certain time problem to which i would draw attention .
this is also referred to in the motion for a resolution .
there was no agreement on a political programme .
they must show that they can provide stability .
in this , they need the political and financial help and support of the european parliament .
the debate is closed .
madam president , we are concerned about one of the great women of this house .
why ?
this then is the first and most important aim of this resolution .
what can the european union do in relation to this matter ?
if we continue they should help this time too .
there are several reasons why a solution has not yet been reached .
since then nothing has happened .
i only hope that the resolution is adopted in its current form , because i believe it can really achieve something .
nothing is being done .
i am given to believe that the court has , in fact , not heard anything about this case because it is not yet time for the court to do so .
'
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
well , it is not .
but , if there is no agreement among them , the commission will put forward a proposal for appropriate legislation in this area .
the debate is closed .
a resolution may not be enough for a problem of this nature .
in other words , we believe that the united nations should be more democratic .
the un is important and needs to be developed .
we now come to the vote .
this really will not do .
there is another problem .
conditions change .
i hope that it would not take so long .
we are not certain how it is going to work out , any more than we are certain about any research programme that we have .
but it has made considerable progress .
this is what members have to do if they want the information .
we welcome the commission proposal .
this will not really do .
it is hard to say .
however , that is a matter to which perhaps we can return .
the debate is closed .
a few months ago the decision was taken as to which countries should be involved in the euro and adopt the single currency .
we always talk about 11 countries , but in reality there are one or two more .
there is still a great deal to be done .
the debate is closed .
the commissioner is now sure to tell us that they all find favour with him .
i do not like it .
this applies to both old and new areas .
those were some of our priorities .
so why does the commission not set priorities ?
this is not in the interests of society .
what reason does the commissioner give for this ?
thus , there is every reason to provide the necessary support .
priority must be given to this in the new five year programme .
it must not be like that in the future !
as regards the budget , i know that additional funds could turn out to be necessary .
these are two different things .
mr president , i have a point of order .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i have it here with me , madam president .
some of us have other work to do .
( the minutes were approved )
it should do the same for the second reading , but it was not mentioned .
we shall look into that .
the other amendments can be put to the vote together .
i have therefore voted against the report .
what has happened ?
we must also support the regional market .
the whole industry is in crisis .
farmers throughout europe see the european union as being responsible for agriculture .
we have to find funding for that .
there are other issues .
what other measures could be taken ?
europe 's farmers need help now .
i want to address four points .
this is the best opportunity to do so .
i am doing so , obviously .
( applause )
but you all know that many member states have still not implemented that directive .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
but what do we mean by further measures ?
however - and i think it important to point this out - , it is not the farmers who are responsible for this situation .
what is the situation like for the consumer ?
we really have to think of the cost to the common agricultural policy in our negotiations .
i think we will agree .
i congratulate the rapporteur .
that is an important aspect of the proposal .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions )
why is this quality policy important ?
of course , we talk about these things and then , in agenda 2000 , not enough attention is given to quality , taken in the environmental sense .
all these aspects are in fact to be given further support under agenda 2000 .
but that is precisely why we first need a clear strategy .
at this stage , it still seems a little too soon to take a final position on this question .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
however , there are a few comments we should like to make .
there are two important points here .
i particularly want to thank the commissioner for being here for this report .
i am not going to do that .
i wish to draw special attention to the environment , with new environmental products and new environmental systems , as an area for development .
but there is still a great deal to be done .
we can make a certain number of conclusions from the report .
the debate is closed .
they have just left one member behind to make sure we do .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
our group has tabled several amendments in this direction .
for all these reasons , our group has not been able to give its support to this report .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
it is now up to the council .
you know there is an old saying that you can never have too much of a good thing .
the joint debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions )
i think we should congratulate ourselves on that .
statement by the president
( applause )
we congratulate them .
we are very pleased for him .
( applause )
( the minutes were approved )
welcome
we shall welcome him here tomorrow .
agenda
the next item is the order of business .
( the order of business was adopted )
i have not had an answer , and now you say that there are no questions in connection with the agenda .
i asked a question , and a very specific one at that .
mr president , if a number of groups have not asked for this , it is because we do not need to deal with it this week .
mrs green , do you wish to take the floor ?
and i believe that he is not speaking on behalf of his group .
i hope it will be available as soon as possible .
commissioner , it is not just safety conditions during transport that matter .
should such matters too not be mentioned in this report ?
we must do that another time .
but i wish the commission every success , and of course we support the proposal .
for this reason , i welcome this proposal , which i consider to be very important and which will ensure greater safety in transport .
the debate is closed .
this is precisely the point that we must discuss .
i consider this to be a proper and important measure .
this cannot and should not be allowed .
this is something we should consider in the context of enlargement .
at the moment the commission is involved .
this is of crucial importance .
this is an issue to which we will have to return in the future .
the debate is closed .
these countries are ireland and germany .
i would like to know the commission 's opinion .
we in the agriculture committee take this matter very seriously .
we in parliament must support the commission in its efforts to put pressure on the member states .
we all agree in principle .
we do not need to change it .
how should we address the problem ?
a final comment : without farmers there would be no environment .
this is no longer the case today .
that is why this matter requires special attention and action .
we must find a solution to this problem , through education first of all .
however , that is not enough .
this is her first day in this parliament .
the debate is closed .
why ?
we call upon the commission to act .
i believe this to be a very important conclusion .
why are they a cause for concern ?
i would question that .
we can then use this as a basis for specific health protection measures .
the debate is closed .
i have two questions to the commissioner in this context .
and my second question concerns transport and energy .
we need to take action .
perhaps you can do something about it ?
i am pleased with this communication , but only as a first step .
let us change that .
i welcome the commission 's concern for nature in europe .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
the same applies to me , madam president .
( the minutes were approved )
statement by the president
this is therefore an amendment to the agenda .
my group is in favour .
( parliament approved the request )
decision on urgent procedure
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
let us now turn to the individual budgets , beginning with our own .
these are the most significant aspects of the budgets for the ' other institutions ' .
is this right ?
we must not be taken in by this .
discussions continue on some aspects .
it is the result of many parliamentary initiatives .
we wish to support it .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the economy is crucial to job creation .
the second point is research policy .
on both matters , we received the support of a majority of the committee on budgets , and for this i wish to thank the rapporteur in particular , and her colleagues in the budgets committee in general .
let us hope that it will work in practice .
this will give an opportunity for cooperation between different programmes .
the problem is that people do not know about it , which is why we need to develop a better information policy .
we know how important they are .
but we look towards the future as far as the amsterdam treaty is concerned .
now a few comments , both on the debate on next year 's budget and on the 1998 budget .
we have taken account of this .
mr president , first of all i would thank the rapporteur for her work .
in that sense , it was particularly important for me to hear about the matters of particular concern to parliament , and of course to understand them .
obviously , i will bring these into the council 's discussions .
( applause )
as the commissioner said , if we adopt that strategy the commission will have to call on own resources from the member states earlier in the year .
i turn now to the different areas .
we have problems even in our group about this .
the reality is that the majority of our group will be voting against the amendment which will put the money on the line .
finally , mr president , the court of justice .
let me move now to comments on other institutions .
i move to the commission budget .
that is the purpose of that amendment .
it always said in the amendment that this was up to the second reading .
in budgetary terms it can be said that parliament has made much progress , together with the commission and the council .
unfortunately the same cannot yet be said of the council .
i hope that the presidency will have more success at second reading that at first reading .
but there is still a problem in the commission as a whole .
europe 's social cohesion and public health are again at risk .
a different form of cooperation between the european parliament and the council is essential .
now for some more specific issues .
the first concerns humanitarian aid and the ecu .
we do not think that the best approach has been taken .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen . it is done ; we have a budget !
many thanks to her .
we have a budgetary role and we have a budgetary control role .
i believe that this is not the way to go .
this is what happened .
'
finally , we have the increase of over 5 % in the budget for external measures .
this is also open to question .
i know all about these discussions .
that is a good thing .
where do we , the european parliament , stand ?
i should like to add something on research .
commissioner , i have a request for you here .
this is an important point .
it is about the following problem .
my final point concerns the issue of the other institutions .
that will not do !
( applause )
all of us are with you in that .
( applause )
and he has set an example for us all .
you have been an example to all of us and for us , as members of parliament , you are and you will remain the example to follow .
( applause )
but it happened .
thank you very much for your support today .
or has not been up until now , at any rate .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the fact is that a good environment must be a concern in all our activities .
it will certainly be in everyone 's interest .
however , i do not agree with his view that it is the farmers and the farmers alone who should pay .
implementation requires more than legislative action .
i cannot understand why parliament cannot accept such a thing .
under the amsterdam treaty , the eu is called upon to act in the important area of public health .
as should be the case with the application of all new research , transparency and proper information for consumers are important .
agriculture as an industry is three times more important to ireland 's economy than to that of many other european states .
i will not labour the point .
the same thing happened last time .
i would call on my colleagues who proposed it yesterday to think again .
so i ask you to think it over and not to support it in the house .
obviously i do not share that view .
this will improve the commission 's control over the expenditure and will increase our confidence in this respect .
we asked the commission for a report on those measures .
i believe this is important .
i hope that these programmes continue into the future .
we have brought forward proposals to address many of these problems .
i propose a completely different approach .
mr president , i certainly would like to make a small contribution to this debate .
is it going the right way , or where are we going wrong ?
farmers cannot continue as at present .
we need to have a new look at where we are going .
we need to have a new look at our markets .
we need to take a positive position on the way forward .
i refer to the education and culture programmes .
although it was not , we were .
i should like to draw attention to one final aspect : training .
a full year later , nothing has been agreed .
our experience with this procedure has been good .
has that already happened ?
is it going to happen ?
in view of the motion , we will certainly also have to take further clear action on this .
it cannot be and it must not be .
we are in favour of enlargement .
mr president , if you want problems over this in one or two member states , that is the right way to go about it .
i will put off any solution for ever and a day .
amendments have been tabled to that effect .
it is a first step in the right direction .
we should tell farmers that we have made a real effort and applied real resources .
we should draw attention to that .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this is the last budget of this parliamentary term .
it has been my first term in parliament and in the committee on budgets .
in so doing , we have done a very important job , but that is not enough as a political authority .
the next six months will be crucial , not only for the budget of this parliament , but for the future of the european union .
on the subject of own resources , we should not avoid any of the issues .
we are seen to be responsible .
a few comments on the additional amendments which have been approved .
one last thing , mr president .
you see , the money does not go to small farmers .
so we shall need a legal basis for that .
i think that the many , still far too many , people in our countries who are out of work have a right to expect that .
that is why i shall reply only to those questions put by members who are here now .
mr president , i put a question to the council too .
the joint debate is closed .
this has not been done for years .
we must hope that the council also heard what you had to say .
what is the council doing here ?
i hope a decision will be taken to that effect .
well , mr president , it would have been better if this problem had been expressed more clearly , not least in the council 's report .
the second is agenda 2000 .
now for the content of the report .
we need strong institutions , as this report also says .
we need a strong single currency .
in reality , we are dealing here with a very crucial point in the question of a ' people 's europe ' .
one is the question of the financial framework .
that is my serious question to the commission .
so we need to be specific about what it is our citizens want .
i therefore do not understand the point that is being made by the institutional committee .
there was balance with six .
there is balance with 15 .
obviously , we must look at what remains to be done .
it is clear .
the instruments are there .
these points are clearly set out in the treaty itself , so we therefore know that another intergovernmental conference is going to be required , and it needs to be held soon .
that is all i have to say , but just one more word , if i may .
i cannot understand why a request from a member has not been given consideration .
commissioner , thank you very much for your offer .
the debate is closed .
the question is : how to deal with this situation ?
let me , however , give you my own views on the issue .
allow me to mention a few points , perhaps .
they all concern an aspect which you have mentioned .
which strategy should we in fact be developing in future in view of this situation ?
we should not talk around the issue , as we simply need it .
no , we need an international agreement on investment .
and why not ?
but the developing countries too will benefit from this agreement .
this positive development is a direct result of investment .
but these have nothing to do with the investment agreement .
however , the crucial issues are : who takes part in the negotiations ?
this is really crucial .
i know i am right .
does this mean that we are against all agreements ?
no , it does not .
in short , democracy should still have a purpose and a future .
i would like to draw your attention to the fact that the french government is not alone .
but this protection is to be put before the rights of citizens and the rights of the states .
no , world peace is the result of an agreement between democratic governments who create and protect it .
of course not .
i believe that the most important thing is to go into what this agreement is actually concerned with .
not at all .
that is the reality of the situation .
you cannot force investment to take place .
you can do what you like .
that does not mean that there should be any agreement .
i said that quite clearly and i have said that many times before .
if that was heard by the honourable member , she heard what was not said .
all of that is clear .
what does that mean ?
i said :
that is what i said .
and we do not have anything at all against this .
i hope you can agree with me on this , as that would already be important progress .
mr president , i do not know whether you share my opinion .
it will have been well received at home .
the debate is closed .
we know all about those problems .
that is indeed the point of this single market .
all in all we have certainly made some progress .
that means that we - or industry - have another five years .
then it will be up to you how quickly you can deal with it .
that is naturally of great importance for industry , which does much more international business in this area than in any other .
i do think that we can try .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i should like firstly to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work .
we think that the common position is in large part acceptable .
it has for the most part taken in a large number of the amendments we tabled at first reading .
we hope the commission will do so also .
in the main , therefore , our group can support the present amendments .
but there is one amendment i would mention in particular , which is amendment no 1 , because it is the only solution to the problem .
there is no use trying to do that .
unfortunately , we cannot accept the other amendments .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
thank you .
thank you .
you will be included in the list .
its role is now like that of parliamentary governments .
thank you for your attention .
that is also in our own interest and will ensure that we have the conditions for stability and growth in the union .
it is not just a question of technology , it is a question of future jobs .
there is still much work to be done !
( applause )
they are what people want to hear .
in some areas - employment , external relations , home affairs and justice - europe needs to be doing more .
now we must make it work in practice .
then we must make the most of the high level of integration achieved by our countries .
take the example of the european strategy for employment .
why ?
but the commission does not work alone .
the first area concerns the economy and society .
or is it a crisis of the system ?
for that to happen there has to be the political will , of course .
this applies to not only to monetary issues , but to economic matters too .
there must be real political will behind it .
i would now like to turn to the third area in which changes are needed for the union 's future : institutional reform .
and soon there will be 20 - and more .
the second point concerns the reform of the institutions themselves .
europe is not an end in itself .
in that sense as well the moment is right .
i believe in a strong european union .
it is and remains important to us , as it should be .
the members of this parliament were not always sure what this summit would be about .
at least that is what i hope .
but more needs to be done .
this is an extremely important project , in view of the situation in russia .
these include , for example , human rights .
that is all very well .
a statement from you in this direction would be very welcome .
as far as expenditure is concerned , i would like to stress that solidarity must continue to be one of the main guidelines for the union 's actions .
it is time to consider a possible change in the way we look at our resources .
and what about europe ?
and our foreign and security policy ?
that is the point .
we need to know who does what .
i agree with what he said : there is a need for both more and less europe .
in my view , we also need a political europe .
mr president-in-office , there are some things we do know about the future of europe .
one day you will not be able to avoid the real question : what is all this for ?
so they are to be left out of the discussion .
we must start discussing these questions about our future and the institutional issue .
well done !
we simply need a strong commission and a strong council .
what is the problem , you might ask .
the problem is that there is no demand for any such thing in the member states .
one example is the foreign and security policy , about which there has already been some discussion today .
i too believe that this is an important decision .
this is one task the commission has set itself .
thank you for this debate .
many thanks !
( applause )
thank you very much for that speech , mr president-in-office , and i believe the president of the commission would also like to say a few words .
a common economic and monetary policy requires greater coordination on economic policy between the member states than ever before , in order to guarantee effective development in the future .
the responsibility comes down to the national parties .
it is not just markets , people too need to have confidence in this europe .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i share many of the views already expressed in this debate .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .
we cannot therefore support paragraph 11 .
the report also goes further than the amsterdam treaty requires with regard to foreign and security policy .
and that is all .
that will not make a good common foreign policy .
it is not .
i have had the same experience .
i am very well aware that we still have many problems in that area .
mr president , thank you for your statement .
thank you very much !
situation in kosovo
the council 's political committee is meeting at this moment to consider further european union measures .
we will do all we can to achieve that .
he is to begin his work in kosovo the day after tomorrow .
that is a cause for concern .
we have funds available for that , it is a matter of coordination .
we will continue our work on that .
that remains to be seen .
who could make us believe that ?
who are they ?
i would really like to have an answer to that .
is this our only concern ?
these , to my mind , are the real problems .
i am pleased that it has not come to that .
i want to stress this point once again .
that has been our position and it is still our position .
we hope that the general affairs council can provide the necessary legal basis as soon as possible , but this aid must also be made available as quickly as possible .
we in europe should provide the necessary support .
i am right , am i not , madam ?
i am well aware of how difficult this is .
that is all the more reason for us to get down to work .
no !
this is how we can begin to make a contribution , in my opinion .
that is certainly true .
it has not been mentioned much during this debate .
why ?
that too was raised during the debate .
that is at least a first step .
what has happened in kosovo may be a positive step , or it may not amount to much at all .
however , i do not accept the view expressed by some members here that we must take military action under all circumstances .
that is the council 's position .
we should continue to take this common approach !
i simply cannot understand this .
mr president , i have a number of comments .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i should like to thank the commissioner for the information he has just given .
my group is concerned for the citizens , for social stability and democracy .
mr president , i should like to thank the commissioner for his statement .
there are many reasons why this can be so .
that is why i think we must take a very practical approach to this problem .
today the economic and financial crisis in this region has had very serious consequences , and not only for the people there .
the question is what are we doing to achieve this ?
what can they do ?
there needs to be a framework , a culture , a set of institutions that work .
that is what a market is .
there have been others , and the fact that at a given time things may get out of control , for very specific reasons , must not make us give up .
the debate is closed .
this will bring new opportunities for economic growth and employment .
we need to look at quality .
that is not the real world either .
here i can only agree with the rapporteur .
we need common eu rules more than ever before .
the reasons why we voted against it are very clear .
the second rule is competition .
they are his words and i agree with him .
how we move forward towards an information society is a very important matter , and i wish to make three points in this respect .
i think not .
i believe this to be of essential importance .
but what are we doing in the public field ?
this debate has brought to mind the first discussion we held on what we have called the information society .
why ?
never !
what we have here today is something quite different .
of course they have , if they are doing a job .
the competition rules remain in force .
the key question is a quite different one .
but that is not the point .
and does the report mention any of this ?
not in the least .
we still have a positive balance here today .
if we do not create the appropriate market conditions , we will simply find others trying to take over that market .
then it will not happen here .
that is the real problem .
we asked questions about this in the green paper .
so that no longer needs saying here .
of course it must , we have already decided that .
that is not the problem .
true enough .
i hope that will be the case in future discussions .
i would , however , say that there can be no information society without rights , either in europe or the world at large .
it is an important one .
that is what we need .
that is the problem .
the debate is closed .
a great deal .
one thing is clear , however .
i believe that is the point we are discussing today .
the euro 's external value is the result of monetary policy .
i agree .
after that , the european central bank will start to apply its monetary policy .
one more very urgent matter , mr commissioner .
he is not yet able to use them .
as the report states , what is required now is greater coordination between the governments concerned , and between european governments and the governments of countries outside the union regarding the management of the international monetary system .
the debate is closed .
protection of workers
we welcome any initiative taken to achieve that and this is one such initiative .
this is nevertheless a start .
and the european union has done a very great deal for health and safety as part of its social policy .
we did not in fact support all the amendments .
we voted against two of them , amendments nos 1 and 2 .
amendment no 2 is wrong in principle , because member states are asked to give financial aid to companies in difficulties .
there is good reason to adopt this approach .
that is quite the wrong approach , in my view .
that is quite unacceptable .
that would not make sense .
according to one of the rapporteur 's amendments , member states may need to provide financial assistance .
that is not what the amendment of this directive is trying to achieve .
however , i will , of course , be voting in favour of this report .
why has this not been done ?
people 's health should take priority and it is about time these urgent decisions were taken .
the debate is closed .
that is another reason to have this communication at this time .
however , it is having no real effect .
so that is not a single market : no competition there , no help to the consumer .
i wish to congratulate her on her report .
i welcome the commission 's initiative in this area .
the debate is closed .
we hope that it can be implemented .
amendment no 5 is from our committee too , and takes up the council 's question .
so it is up to the european parliament and the council to act .
the reality of course is rather different .
but now we need action not words .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as a member of the committee on budgets , i am always concerned with speaking out in favour of fair structural conditions .
i think it is necessary to offer better training in this area .
commissioner , i have a further question .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
that is the second time this has happened .
thank you , madam president .
thank you for those comments .
once again , we shall look into the matter .
( the minutes were approved )
thank you for your support .
( applause )
my group is in favour .
my group is in favour of voting .
mr president , on a point of order .
i would like to ensure that this is clear .
can we carry the previous vote over to the motion for a resolution ?
of course .
the rapporteur has asked for the floor .
on amendment no 4
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
these are two different resolutions , and while they may say the same thing , i have to put both of them to the vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
let not a single ecu be taken from the farmers !
this is a step in the right direction .
but what can the european council do ?
moreover , with the euro , the european union will become a world power on a monetary level .
therefore , there is an urgent need to develop these policies .
in this model , the commission would become a true government .
we therefore cannot vote for the resolution .
it has become essential to consider the economic aspects of this problem .
the commission proposal is not good enough .
these amendments will have our support .
there is still much to be done here .
this is due legal process .
this cannot be allowed to happen .
the european parliament is not a court of law .
i certainly support every part of the resolution from all the groups concerned .
and in this respect , i believe that this has been an extremely important decision .
the question is what we do with him now ?
it is the justice system that must take the relevant decision and we all hope that that decision will indeed be just .
we hope there will be effective cooperation not just between those two countries , but between all the member states .
almost .
therefore , the european union should have a foreign policy that is based on the defence of freedom , democracy and the rule of law .
thank you , commissioner .
let me say , however , that in my view parliament was right to put this subject on its agenda , and that the house has used this time to good effect .
so what should be done ?
that should not be in his report .
i wish , ladies and gentlemen , that we were as clear about what we are doing in other areas as we are about nuclear energy .
why ?
it is a difficult job , and funding needs to be made available for it .
madam president , during a previous debate on nuclear power , i expressed a certain number of concerns about this form of energy .
that is the crucial problem .
what does the commission have to say about all that ?
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
madam president , i think we have achieved a good compromise on this report .
indeed , we are not talking about small change .
but , in these circumstances , it was difficult for me as rapporteur to draw any final conclusions as regards the environmental effects of this programme .
what is it that we want ?
how far do we want to go ?
what do we need to have before we can say that it is good enough ?
there may be many reasons for this .
this means that some people have received money for doing something they would have done in any case .
we must return to this issue again when discussions are held on the legislative proposals for agenda 2000 .
it also goes back a long way as far as this term of parliament is concerned .
in my home region , the farmers already have quite some experience of these things .
who has ever mentioned that ?
so who can decide ?
that problem will not go away .
in fact , they note that the objectives have not been achieved .
madam president , thank you for the ten minutes .
i shall begin with my own three minutes .
that was the aim behind these environmental measures .
my third point concerns the funding issue .
here i agree with you .
so i am in agreement with you here .
we must ensure this does not happen within the european union .
i do not have any problem with that .
thank you .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i find that unacceptable .
i therefore voted against the whole report .
the local authorities used to have more scope to decide how to implement the programme .
that is why we should support it .
let me mention four more points .
of course they do .
those are the comments i wanted to make regarding those two reports .
we have also provided these authorities with appropriate guidelines .
after all , these regions are where the people of europe live .
the debate is closed .
all well and good !
when we pay out money , we must also be sure that there is proper control .
that is not good enough !
we need to have proper control over the use of all these resources .
do you want to make things even more difficult ?
what is the reason for that ?
therefore , let us look at the subject under debate .
what , in fact , is it all about ?
the second was the enlargement from 12 to 15 countries .
i cannot agree with this approach .
however , i would really like to know why certain environmental measures are successful in some countries but not others .
we heard about this in the earlier debate .
so there is a good opportunity for us to debate and find the best way forward .
i am a little concerned about it .
these measures are important , and i welcome the proposals in this area , commissioner , which you have made in the agenda 2000 framework .
but now to the business in hand .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i would therefore like to put the following request to you .
but this has nothing to do with the minutes .
i see that there are no comments on the minutes .
( the minutes were approved )
mr president , on a point of order .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , i feel that i must comment on the result of this vote .
i voted in favour of the report .
but this is not the case in this report .
people need it and use it .
therefore , this is a serious problem .
and the problem is by no means new .
they are also small countries ' only protection .
it is an excellent basis for the green paper .
it is not clear from the report why the commission and parliament should take this on .
in my view , the european parliament does not need to make resources available to promote cooperation .
that was long ago .
now comes the ' but ' .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
perhaps we might set them an example here in the european parliament .
the debate is closed .
the people concerned were not able to carry out the project because they had no money to pay for it .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
parliament has now come to the end of its agenda .
i hope , ladies and gentlemen , that i am successful .
statement by the president
welcome
are there any comments ?
the parliament has had an opportunity to debate this question and has made its views clear .
i do not understand what has happened .
can you tell me what has happened to that request ?
clearly it is not on today 's agenda .
clearly , if no decision has been taken he will have nothing to tell us .
mr president , on a point of order .
we have to hope that we never have to do that again .
we must look forward and not back .
i have not received an answer .
i am not saying that the commission was not right to do this . but it is not enough to be right ; you have to know how to be right and the commission does not know .
this really is a matter of principle .
( the minutes were approved )
enlargement
the next item is the commission communication on progress reports on the countries which have applied for accession .
i hope they will reach you as soon as possible .
we know more and we understand better .
this was the only way to be fair , and to be seen to be fair , to all countries .
mr president , on a point of order .
it was the commission which said that it would present its report today .
mr president , let me do mrs green and our president too something of a favour .
i think that is a far better idea .
i have no programme .
it is not me who makes the agenda .
you have just approved the agenda with these changes .
why do we say that ?
he will of course need a certain time for implementation .
i am talking about the group of six .
my only answer is that i hope this is so .
so it is very close .
what is going on ?
these decisions are always difficult .
so the answer to the honourable member is : no .
sustainable integration can only be achieved if all the community institutions , and of course also the member states , take the appropriate initiatives .
although energy , transport and agriculture are without doubt particularly important sectors of integration , of course they are not the only relevant policy areas .
we need to make changes in these policies in order to improve the environment .
we are indeed therefore working very hard to ensure that this proposal is adopted .
i am very pleased with the comments they have made today .
it is not enough to say these things , welcome though the words are .
we need to do them as well .
it is not enough to say there is a need to do it .
this resolution goes in the right direction .
it is most important for our citizens to be aware of the true nature of the community 's legislative institutions .
and we need to do it well , because then the member states will have a good example to follow .
we have made a number of demands .
every six months at least , we want a joint council meeting between the environment ministers and other ministers for agriculture , transport and so on .
i do not believe it is enough to speak of sustainable development in a general way .
on regional and structural policy the commission 's proposals are good as far as words go , but not enough has been done in practice .
we have to take action , and to do so we need the right instruments .
but at the same time we need a sense of common purpose .
we not only have the right strategy , i believe we have the only possible strategy .
we know of no other , we know of no better .
we should be equal partners , and here it will be important to act at community level .
i agree with parliament that it is a good thing that the presidency and the commission are having this debate with parliament today .
it is a community project .
only if all the parties involved accept and understand the situation can we hope for better decisions to be taken .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
my final point concerns the special provisions .
that is all i have to say , madam president .
in this way we can ensure that there will be no safety risk of any kind .
here too , account must be taken of consumer protection .
it must be said that we do not have this at the moment .
we already have a considerable number of scientific reports on the subject , and we should further develop and support these initiatives .
however , there have been problems with the implementation of this in certain member states and thus the commission 's current approach is welcome .
we have the instruments available .
i have tabled certain amendments .
let me begin my reply with a general consideration .
it is a fact of life !
as we heard during the debate , a number of member states have done nothing at all , so we must do more .
overall , the report takes the same line we did .
we do not agree with the following points of the report .
in our view , that would be going a little too far .
as soon as we have it , we shall set to work .
the debate is closed .
the commission has not done this .
i have done it as rapporteur .
it cannot .
but we cannot in my view do any less .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this house wanted this legislative proposal and with just cause .
mr president , i do not want to follow the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights in their discussion of whether this report is in order or not .
that does not mean , however , that all of us on the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection follow her entirely down that road .
i should therefore like to make the following comments .
we shall then be able to discuss it again in the house .
in some member states , the changes in question were made a long time ago .
that makes the single market work better .
that is one point .
naturally there are a few problems .
not that this house ever wanted changes here .
to that extent , it is a good thing not only for europe 's consumers but also for agriculture itself .
in what field ?
that will be the right time to do so .
that was not in the commission proposal !
so what about the commission 's right of initiative ?
we can discuss that .
let me say something about their content .
we will be having it .
we are still at first reading .
so the commission cannot adopt those amendments .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
culture 2000
i would also like to mention the development of european cultural resources .
the first concerns cultural cooperation agreements .
the second point i want to mention is the budget .
it is a programme which will develop as time goes by .
what has the commission proposed ?
we should have had a longer debate .
one conference was not really enough .
it is now and not later that the european union must become both an economic and cultural union .
mr president , if i could begin again , i would start with culture .
but actually the work is only just beginning .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , that is the commission 's position .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i am sure members will agree with me in this respect .
it should not happen .
it does not deal in any respect with the social agenda .
it will really help the companies of the european union .
that is where the amendments should be included .
this is why we must also look at the political aspects of these issues .
but let me tell you first what i like in all of this .
this is as it should be .
this is the point the committee on employment and social affairs is making .
the whole thing would then make sense , and our proposed amendments should be seen in this light .
yet this should never have been in question .
of course not .
mr president , i think there is a fundamental problem here .
but of course he is a new labour member .
that is something which the commission and the council should look at .
i am very pleased that this is accepted for the first time in many member states .
nor do i think that the changes it makes are essential , if i may say so .
i agree entirely with what the commissioner said .
the debate is closed .
they want to know clearly who to go to for what .
but to what extent are these funds used ?
i have a few more points to add .
the debate is closed .
education programmes
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
all we can say is that this is the only thing we can really do to help people to become good european citizens .
as rapporteur , i have been concerned from the start to address the following points .
we have one or two more points to make .
this idea was brought up during discussions on next year 's budget .
unfortunately , this is not the only thing these programmes have in common .
excellent projects are often developed under these programmes to promote that kind of thing .
however , there are a number of very specific practical problems .
education is a task for europe .
it goes without saying that europe is an education community .
mr president , i shall not be able to comment on all the excellent reports we have heard today , since time is short and i wish to focus in particular on the programmes concerned with young people .
i hope we will move towards that in the future .
i want to make three clear points .
new labour clearly does not respect her as much as members in this house .
so far she has not done so .
i think that changes will have to be made here in future .
we need more money .
that is the important point .
we need to change the way we think .
thanks to their efforts , you can give your opinion during this same sitting on the reports relating to the three programmes .
in my opinion , it is very important that these issues are being considered at the same time .
and i accept the amendments that go in this direction .
mr president , i should like to put a comment to the commissioner .
the debate is closed .
these are the amendments we can accept .
however , we cannot accept the amendments of a budgetary nature .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i said most of them .
we will be voting that position .
what you have said has already made parliament aware of the issue , but we will consider it at the appropriate time .
so let us stop here .
on amendment no 11
but i really cannot accept this amendment .
we have already said enough about the free movement of workers as a political statement .
let us go no further with that discussion .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i think we all agree on that .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the principle must always be that the rules - whether national or european - which protect consumers best must be applied .
only in this way can the member states take a decision on the matter in the council of ministers .
what i would like to talk about , however , are the serious legal problems presented by certain amendments .
in fact , it is the commission that has the power of initiative in terms of legislation .
it goes without saying that i support fully the draft legislative resolution proposed here .
first of all , i should like to establish that this programme of activities is of fundamental importance .
it could be made more effective and more relevant , for example .
that is why i will be voting in favour of this report .
on the whole , we also support the proposed changes to the programmes .
the new proposal for which we have voted is quite different .
the issue of the free movement of workers should be the subject of its own report .
we will stand by them .
i am voting against the report for the following reasons .
it was quite right to stress the value of a good outside assessment of the commission 's activities .
in short : the commission should do less , but do it better .
are there any comments ?
i would like to have a response on this matter , mr president .
something has to be done soon and we have to face up to it .
this is not the right time to ask it .
you know the way to put questions to the commission , so use it .
this is not the time to put questions to the committee , nor to the council .
you cannot have the floor .
since there are no further comments , the minutes are approved .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
mr president , i just wanted to make a point of order .
it is not in my power to do so .
( parliament approved the request )
( parliament approved the request )
( parliament approved the request )
we hope we will come to a conclusion now and take a decision .
i believe that is unacceptable .
that was our priority .
this is a very serious matter that we are dealing with today .
we must have the data if the committee on budgetary control is to do its job . this is a serious matter .
the presidency had to make it change the legal basis .
what conclusions should we draw from this ?
i will come back to this later .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we are less concerned with them .
that is why the national authorities have little experience there .
full use is not being made of the instruments at hand .
let me end on that note - i thank you for your attention and hope for further good cooperation between parliament and the presidency !
but what is to be done ?
but now allow me to turn to the report itself .
there are , however , some points for concern .
but time is short .
mr president , i have three points to make on this report .
there are three main points .
we should help them to implement these programmes in the interest of europe and in their own interest .
that is what our citizens expect of the european union , and it is absolutely vital to the security of the european union as a whole .
first things first .
we should do all we can to promote confidence in the euro .
each will have its own job to do in any future system .
the protection of the euro will be the responsibility of both the community and the member states , however .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
so the commission was right to propose a programme to deal with this problem .
most but not all of these amendments were accepted .
mr president , parliament has expressed the wish for changes to the common position .
the debate is closed .
no !
but we must also make that clear under this directive .
i would like to believe that the commission will accept all these amendments .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , the same thing happened to me yesterday .
( the minutes were approved )
that is not the point , mr president .
that is not the problem .
decision on urgent procedure
president .
mr president , this is an issue which we have had to deal with before .
i put the request for urgent procedure to the vote .
why ?
so much for that area of the agricultural policy .
the aid has indeed reached the people in need of it .
in this report , we have established some significant things .
i think this is a very important point .
but that is your decision !
we were asked for such an opinion by the council .
in conclusion , may i offer our thanks for the excellent cooperation we have had with parliament .
i therefore have two questions .
secondly , can we expect a report on this specific issue , or can we call upon you to provide this ?
you also mentioned this in your report .
we will have a great deal more to discuss on this issue .
but i would like to make more specific points .
that is an overall assessment .
have you received these reports yet ?
and if so , what is your assessment of them ?
i would therefore like to ask : has progress been made ?
is this coordination currently taking place ?
so that was the end of that .
that naturally requires there to be cooperation with the member states .
i know that is difficult , but we must do something about this .
however , we have heard that this is precisely what is currently being prepared by the commission .
however , i must make two points here .
we have referred to a few points in that area .
that should be taken into account in this decision .
i understand your concern , and we will discuss this again .
we have also referred to this in the relevant special report .
i can only say in this discussion that the nature of the task is not the same ; it is quite different .
( applause )
in the agenda 2000 proposals , the member states carry the main responsibility for the financial control of the structural funds assistance .
the new commission rules come into effect for the implementation of the 1999 budget .
that is mentioned in the report and it means that in that sector there was no financial impact on the budget .
we are not there yet , but we must not give up .
the debate is closed .
employment in the union
that is an extremely good thing .
but things could be even better .
but i do have a problem with the proposals put forward by the european commission .
it is no different in other countries of the union .
what are we doing about economic coordination ?
what use are we making of these opportunities ?
i am not coming down in favour of one proposal rather than the other .
it is important that the employment guidelines are actually implemented under national action programmes .
that is the conclusion which the union 's citizens reach .
we will stand by them in that .
this culture of information - i would even go so far as to say joint management - is a step in the right direction .
i should like to focus on one aspect , commissioner , which is extremely important to me .
but that means too that women must get at least their fair share of any benefit from such measures .
secondly , we also want a clear commitment to more training opportunities for people currently in work .
this stability plan is more concerned with monetary stability than with the stability of employment .
furthermore , why not propose a review of the central bank 's key role ?
mr president , the commission 's report is on employment in europe in 1998 .
it is not really possible to work in these conditions .
perhaps not enough change , but at least some .
these are the main points .
it is time now for clear decisions to be taken .
this means that growth on its own does not create as many jobs as we need .
we also need structural measures in the labour market , and it is to this that we should turn our attention .
a year ago i presented to parliament the first set of employment guidelines .
your comments and those of the house have been taken fully into consideration .
i think that is going to happen .
we need better implementation , but i think we will be successful .
but that is not the point i wish to make .
we will have to consider how it is going to be done .
the debate is closed .
it is the same date in both cases .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i would like to make it clear that the request does not come from our group .
other groups ask for them as well .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
in the committee on budgetary control , i was the only one to vote against .
as it has done already .
i cannot support the use of legal procedures of this kind .
mr president , a model for political action in europe is the market economy , or at least the social market economy .
the consequences of european monetary union , of the euro and of enlargement to the east , on which our committee has often asked for information , are not mentioned .
i think we have a new process here .
and i do not think there are too many problems .
that has not really been taken into account .
there is , however , a problem .
and why was that ?
because what is the european social model ?
that does nothing to make it any more real , however .
there is a different basis for social policy in the individual countries .
we do still need to improve matters there .
on the whole , the new programme is an excellent basis for the eu 's social and labour market policy in the next few years .
that will not bring many people into work .
i would also like to comment on the social dialogue .
let us be clear .
there will be the impact of the employment strategy .
we have a budget line to do all this in 1999 so we are going to continue to develop it .
i ask for your support for the plan .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
social dialogue
the amendments approved by the committee do not stand in the way of this .
the commission has not provided anything new .
i would now like to address a key issue .
i am concerned about the role of parliament in this whole process .
we could put it this way , mr president .
it is for this reason that i really welcome last week 's decision by the commission .
this is another success and i hope to do the report .
the social dialogue is necessary at both european and national levels .
this is a very good report .
you know where i stand and where my support is on that point .
we understand that great progress is being made , and certainly i support that .
there are real problems there .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but they are not within their rights to decide this themselves .
i believe that this is a good report and we should support it .
mr president , these relations are also extremely important as far as jobs are concerned .
in my view , things can get better here if not only the eu authorities but the us authorities too take greater account of social and employment issues in rural areas .
we must move more quickly in future with the new measures .
certainly not !
do we know what we want to say on the new issues of society and regulation ?
yet we in the committee were only able to see it when the vote had already taken place .
mr president , the debate about the united states and europe is an old one .
why will europe not accept them ?
i believe that we are and must continue to be partners on equal terms .
however , we obviously need to do more .
my thanks to france .
mr president , i would like to make a few comments .
earlier this year , parliament approved a resolution on the environmental , health and consumer protection aspects of world trade .
the commission 's communication does not take sufficient account of them .
but there is no question of that .
therefore the principles here are very important indeed .
there are a number of questions that we need to ask .
it needs to be shown up for what it is .
what had to be said has already been said by the other members .
that is the first reason .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
what view does the commission take of these recent developments ?
there is no need for the commission to present a new proposal .
are additional security measures necessary here ?
i have been trying for a number of years , without much success .
we will have an opportunity to discuss the matter further at that time .
i thank the commissioner for her reply .
i hope that is not the case here .
i want to thank the commissioner for her very full reply .
mr president , i understand the concern .
monitoring of these projects is therefore subject to national legislation .
this was particularly important for the commission given the significant increase in the number of new projects .
do you know anything about that ?
in other words , is it possible that my country will have to return money to the european union and the commission ?
if this is the case , parliament could agree , in particular , to the proposal for a structural fund regulation with general terms and conditions by the end of the current legislative period .
the regulation could then be finally adopted in may 1999 .
i hope very much that parliament at least will do this tomorrow at the first reading on the reform of the structural funds .
however , as was already said , this is the commission 's proposal , and the council and parliament still have to agree to it .
the same is not true of the community initiatives .
the question which is always asked in this connection , of course , is the question of how much .
how does the situation look for the next support period , as far as you can tell ?
or what about the present commission 's term of office ?
or perhaps the term of office of the next president of the united states is the appropriate period of time ?
the position is , that we will not carry out our part of the agreement if the united states does not carry out its part .
i hope that the commission will take that view in its relations with the wto .
i would also bring to his attention some more recent events .
we have made very good progress on the market access question .
there are other aspects that still have to be considered .
commissioner , thank you very much for your answer .
you must do one or the other .
i am very pleased to see the commissioner here .
we get very little opportunity to speak to the commissioner .
nevertheless , commissioner , you may take the floor if you wish .
there is absolutely nothing new in this .
there is nothing more in it than has been available in the past .
we are talking about the monitoring of elections .
so where do we go from here ?
the commission will make that request before the second reading of the budget .
i am quite sure that we cannot achieve it in 1999 , but i think 1999 has to be the basis for further developments .
that would help us .
but the dialogue did not take place .
of course this also applies to the democracy programmes .
i wish you every success , and i thank you for your attention .
or should i say that things are not that great ?
i very much agree with you that a solution should now be found to this particular issue .
rather , we want to stress that we are the home of human rights and we can therefore give others assistance .
why could we not do this ourselves ?
commissioner , it would be good if you could do this .
i would also like to ask what problems you had with external support .
so above all let us agree on where we stand .
the commission cannot do all that itself without outside assistance .
i think that is the main priority .
the debate is closed .
once again , my thanks go to the rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
these are things which will also be good for jobs in europe .
i believe it is time now for us to move forward in order to give the citizens of europe an economic democracy .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , we are talking about the future , and the future is very important for everyone .
i would ask the commissioner to take this a little further .
the debate is closed .
we have come back to that proposal in this report .
this , however , can and should no longer be the task of this house and its members .
the debate is closed .
we must therefore pay particular attention to developing this sector .
that will create many new jobs in europe .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it is only a matter of time .
i think it is possible to reach agreement on that point as well .
european monetary union is the first step .
the second step is social and environmental union .
that is the only way to develop a european economy .
that is crucial .
the rapporteur 's proposals are therefore a step in the right direction and i support them .
and what do we find now ?
i believe there is every reason .
mr president , everything has been said , but not by everyone and certainly not by me .
for that reason , i should like to add a few words on the subject in general .
why ?
they have asked us to do this and there is no reason not to meet their request .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i wish to make that point .
i am not sure why that should be of such importance .
since there are no further comments , the minutes are approved .
agenda 2000
the commission will also take part in this dialogue .
i believe that overall we have made good progress here .
what was the reason for this ?
however , parliament does not just have a legislative role .
clearly , until there is agreement on every aspect , there will be no agreement .
what is the real issue ?
considerable efforts are still needed before we are prepared .
this applies to reform of its policies .
it will happen again today .
perhaps i might try to list one or two of these points .
we want to decide agenda 2000 during this parliamentary term , before the elections .
let the council do the same !
you may be sure we are aware of that !
the people of europe must be able to have confidence in the european union 's decisions .
in fact the people do not want less europe , they want more .
the second major task is to reform the common policies , with particular reference to agricultural and structural policy .
the third task concerns reform of the european union 's institutions .
under the amsterdam treaty , the european parliament has a new role to play .
instead of real values , we see monetary values - a currency .
time will show this to be the case .
what progress have we actually made ?
the debate is closed .
welcome
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this requires political will and clear objectives .
i believe that this may help the process .
as in the case of the cohesion fund , we shall have to ensure a good balance between the two areas .
in that respect , we welcome the commission 's proposal , subject to the amendments we have tabled , which we hope will be taken into account in the further discussions .
let me add something on the amendments , because in my view the order of the voting list is wrong .
to start with , i fully support the rapporteur 's point of view .
is the political will really there ?
however , money is not everything .
he was right .
it really is a very , very good model , much better than all the other things that have been proposed .
but this is not the case .
structural funds would then be needed .
that was the problem .
we have , however , tabled two amendments on which we would like to hear the commission 's position before the vote on this report .
it is amendment no 2 .
far more important , however , is amendment no 1 .
we believe such a step would be quite wrong .
but be that as it may .
that means the programmes have to be of a high quality .
regarding the proposed amendments , i should like to make the following point .
however , i would like to stress the following point .
welcome
( applause )
mr president , on a point of order .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we voted on 12 amendments with one vote .
welcome
you are quite right .
amendment no 2
( parliament adopted the resolution )
welcome
( applause )
this would not be good for this house .
everyone is aware of this situation so i will not go into it .
that is no way to achieve what you want .
that is all you can do .
i would ask my colleagues in this house to agree that we vote on it today , and that we also vote in favour .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
they have the same rights as those who can hear , but while this is obviously the case in the united states , it is often not so here in the union .
this is completely unacceptable in the single market .
in any case , i hope that this resolution has more of an impact on the member states than was the case with our resolution of ten years ago .
we have decided to vote for the report for the above reasons .
i voted against the report for the above reasons .
the council , commission and parliament should all share responsibility for this .
the new social action programme is very important in the union 's development of its social and labour market policies .
'
in principle , we do not believe that social and labour market policy should be a matter for the union .
i do not believe that this is what we wish to achieve .
i will therefore vote against this paragraph .
i welcome the report 's aim of increasing employment .
we should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on this important report .
i have therefore decided to change my position in the final vote .
european integration is a whole in which all europe 's citizens should be involved .
therefore , we must welcome the commission 's wish to develop the social dialogue in these countries .
in quite a short time the issue of the social dialogue has again come up for debate in the european parliament .
so the european parliament should now say that this cannot go on .
it did not do so .
i do not share his view .
but i do not want to go into that any further at this point .
the committee on employment and social affairs was particularly concerned with social and employment policy questions .
if that applies in europe , it also applies in the integration process .
let us perhaps look back a few years , or even longer .
the debate is closed .
structural funds
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the same applies to the single currency .
in that context , the structural funds play a very important part .
but reform is necessary .
therefore , as well as having a good technical document , we now also have a good political document .
we shall be voting on that tomorrow .
but as the budgets committee we are concerned by two things in particular .
so , we as a committee welcome the new rules being put forward in this way by the commission .
the amendments are to all five reports and are technical amendments .
by this i mean the environment , culture and social services .
it is also necessary to use local employment initiatives to create more employment .
these are new priorities for assistance that have the support of all groups .
perhaps the fisheries policy is not such a common policy as the agricultural policy ?
in our opinion there is therefore no reason for it to continue to exist in its present form .
the structural funds have this democratic approach .
there are not enough european lead projects .
i should particularly like to thank her for the commitment she has shown .
we agree on the basic direction to be taken .
of course europe should also play its part .
i support this completely .
the proposal is too general .
what is our decision ?
why has the same thing not happened in the fisheries sector since it , like agriculture , has its own common policy ?
this morning we have already heard a great deal on the subject of enlargement .
this is an important issue but it is not the only one .
the long discussions in the committee on regional policy have achieved a great deal .
i shall have to stop there .
we have reached that point now .
let me turn now to the individual points , and firstly to the cohesion fund .
we hope the house can accept our amendment .
with regard to objective 2 , i do not agree with you .
i fully agree with you on the three community initiatives .
national assistance is better and i would support it .
that is an act of justice .
european integration has not quite reached that stage yet .
the commission has done its best .
the commission itself has proposed it , and we all know that special measures are needed .
mr president , the structural funds have been a great success for europe in ireland .
then we can at least take measures to prevent them or reduce their impact .
the aid measures by the international community are now under way .
thank you for your attention ; i am of course available at any time to answer further questions during the debate .
the european parliament , with the support of the council and the commission , has always expressed strong political support for the integration of this region .
it is time to act .
their main concerns are the following .
unfortunately , this has not always been the case in the past .
but that is for now .
the people concerned must have a say and a right of control here .
a great deal has already been done by countries all over the world , including in europe .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we have heard it many times .
that is part of it .
a majority of central american states have seen their development set back by years .
this too has already been discussed in the general affairs council .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
mr president , madam president-in-office , thank you for your report .
parliament is also prepared to do so .
that is quite unacceptable !
that is where we must try to achieve our results .
implementation of the existing agreements is vital .
can the president-in-office or the commissioner tell us what the problems are ?
the resolutions mention specific areas where we can provide support , and i entirely agree with these .
not very much - at most a resolution here in parliament .
mr president , i would like to thank the president-in-office for her statement .
i think our commitment in this situation should not be to one side or to the other but to success .
i would propose two measures here .
and we made every effort to achieve that .
yet i believe that is not the right approach to take .
what is important is to make progress towards peace .
i think that is precisely what we must all do .
mr president , the commission has an important role to play in this matter .
i wanted to make that clear .
that is a key point that has come out of this debate .
but when all is said and done , implementation is the key .
we have a contribution to make .
there were a few mentioned .
so that is a positive development that we can support .
the debate is closed .
we must act now .
there are various areas of this type in the european union .
madam president , i would like to speak about the proposal for a regulation on structural actions in the fisheries sector .
i would consider that point , which was also the subject of our discussion in the committee on employment and social affairs , to be particularly significant .
on this we are in full agreement with the commission .
i do hope the commission will take the committee 's proposal seriously .
that is why the commission cannot support a number of proposals on implementation in the report .
i think that would also take account of some of the problems that you have mentioned here .
in the past i have always made this point clear , and it should be made clear here as well .
i think that is something we all want .
a final important point on the general regulation has to do with parliament 's role in the application of the structural fund regulation .
it does this .
the first is the amendments concerning the field of application .
i think that before we work on a new legislative proposal , it would make sense for us to discuss it together and see if we can reach agreement as far as possible .
however , let me be clear .
support will still be available for these groups .
the debate is closed .
madam president , i would first like to welcome the president-in-office of the council .
this is all well and good .
i think that more information is needed .
in this respect , it would be appropriate to consider what measures we are prepared to take in order to prevent this .
sometimes the results show that they are right , and sometimes not .
let me now focus on the new proposals on rural development .
the european council itself , moreover , has expressed the view that the commission proposals offer a basis for further reform of the common agricultural policy .
thank you .
could you make your statement at the end , or do you wish to speak at this point ?
what stage have are reached in the reform debate ?
moreover , we need real reform .
and what if we do not ?
do we want that ? do you want that ?
this is a good idea , and we have nothing against it in principle .
i think it will be best for everyone .
madam president , commissioner , mr president-in-office , i would simply like to make two points .
a european agricultural model does exist .
and what of the world market ?
this is also the price we pay for european integration .
i hope more consideration will be given to these needs in future .
we should ask ourselves what we have done wrong .
we are the people with the responsibility within the commission and parliament .
we are the people who have to point the way forward .
we are the people who have to find and ensure that there is a way forward .
i fully agree that the union must plan its course for the future .
why do we need this policy ?
i think the need for reform is more or less agreed .
it is therefore very important for us that support should be given to rural development and agriculture .
the criteria for support should remain the same .
support will also continue to be provided for areas and sectors which have special problems .
after all , the problem is not one of production .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of our group i should like to express support for mrs green 's proposal .
but we should like to stress two points in particular .
statement by the president
they have their established powers .
i will not allow any further debate on this question .
if we vote in favour here , that would support the view of the committee on regional policy , and then we would have to say for all three : they are in .
that is why i should like things to be clear .
but it was adopted - the result was quite clear .
that is why you have to put it to the vote .
but it was adopted - that was the decision of the house .
i therefore believe that i must stand by what i said yesterday .
( parliament decided to refer the matter back to committee )
before the vote on the draft legislative resolution
( parliament decided to refer the matter back to committee )
i should like to make that clear here .
before the final vote
( parliament approved a request from the rapporteur for the matter to be referred back to committee )
madam president , i do not want to be held responsible for this .
i think that we should act in line with our rules .
in that case i should like to request that the report be referred back to the committee responsible .
( parliament decided to refer the matter back to committee )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament decided to refer the matter back to committee )
( parliament decided to refer the matter back to committee )
i understand that most members agree with this .
( parliament agreed to the proposal )
we voted against this report for the following reasons .
however , we could not vote in favour of the final resolution .
and what about the different areas of agenda 2000 ?
in terms of the structural funds , the first two objectives are very different from the third .
in this respect , there is a need for reform of the structural funds .
i have decided , in the main , to support the social democratic group .
unfortunately , in the final vote i had to vote against , because
we have voted against the report on the cohesion fund .
it does not come under the eu 's regional and structural funding , but is direct aid to those countries .
the cohesion fund is very important with respect to economic and social solidarity in europe .
as such , i indeed support the report as presented to us today .
social and labour market policy must continue to be a national matter .
the fund is also to encourage local and regional initiatives on employment .
today , only two common policies exist : the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy .
so much for the positive comments .
much remains to be done in the field of asylum and immigration policy .
there is no common return policy .
this cannot and must not continue .
this will certainly have an effect one way or another .
my group would like to add two further conditions .
i believe there is good reason for this .
that is why we cannot accept these two proposals in this form .
however , this all goes without saying .
these are not my words .
this is a very important measure and i hope it is successful .
we all know what that would mean .
it has to be one thing or the other !
that is clear .
there is no doubt that the commission needs to consider once again here whether its approach is really the right one .
that is why , in the motion , we call for humanitarian aid , as well as food aid , to be provided .
it is therefore an excellent thing for the commission to have taken this initiative .
time is short .
it is really an economic problem .
we must address all the questions of food , health , the economy and political stability in one programme , if that is possible .
and so to the question of food aid : when you have problems in common , you have opportunities in common .
i welcome the content of the motion for a resolution now before us and we also regard this as important support for our work in this field .
that too we could not allow .
finally a few words about the more specific humanitarian aid .
the debate is closed .
i therefore believe that with this resolution , parliament will support their efforts , in line with public opinion throughout europe .
the debate is closed .
and that is the nature of the motion for a resolution before the house today .
international criminal court
as far as we are concerned , recent events provide reason enough to set up this international court quickly .
we want the criminal court to start on time !
mr president , commissioner , we are dealing with a specific case here .
that is not enough .
more progress is needed .
our joint resolution does that .
i should nevertheless like to say a few words on behalf of my group .
perhaps this matter could be raised in that context !
that is true both of our own countries and our partners .
i agree with all that has been said about the international criminal court .
the commission is also naturally pleased at the successful conclusion of the conference which set up the court .
what i have mentioned here is part of this .
thank you , commissioner .
i shall bring this up again , but there is already a decision on the matter .
the debate is closed .
we have therefore voted against the report .
we would simply like to ask whether the national , european and global levels that already exist are not enough without a community level as well ?
in relation to the two proposals put forward by the commission , madam president , i would like to congratulate the commissioner .
the practice is , of course , due to two points .
in my opinion , both aspects are very important .
the debate is closed .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this is certainly not the most important report of the week .
we did actually have two reports on the subject .
however , it is clear which direction we are going in .
that was already clear to us in the committee .
we wish to achieve the same thing for amendments to the joint list .
that is what is provided for in the amsterdam treaty .
we support this because it is parliament 's responsibility to do so .
i think this is the wrong approach .
allow me to begin with the technical aspects of the document .
i do not share his views on the legal basis .
however , the commission is not a government .
the commission is not supported by a majority in the european parliament .
the commission has no specific comment to make at the present stage .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
we shall see what can be done .
i wanted to vote against it .
( the minutes were approved )
we shall take it into account .
it would be better to give more authority to member states and to the council .
what are the important points then ?
i should like to single out the five most important points made in this proposal .
we shall be voting for the amendments .
i think that is too much to hope for .
the issue involved is of key importance for the future of the young people of europe .
i would hope that the rapporteur takes this into account next time .
let us now look at the amendments tabled by the european parliament .
therefore , the commission cannot accept this final amendment .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
wto : financial services
what is this report about ?
moreover , this agreement comes at a good time .
that is our task for the future .
nevertheless , there are some problems .
however , i would like to address another aspect of the issue .
for that reason , the markets are not free .
however , this is precisely the case today .
there is an urgent need for reform here .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
mr president , i would like to say on behalf of the commission that i agree with what you said .
if the euro is a success , integration will soon follow .
i say perhaps , because no final decisions have been taken yet .
it is not the first time .
we are clear on this and always have been .
it is indeed a matter of culture .
unfortunately , there is another candidate .
i would not wish to measure myself against him , to fight him for the job .
so what do you want ?
i have even done something which was perhaps not right in legal terms .
well , i will not accept that .
let us be quite clear about it .
the reason is technology .
why not ?
why not give them that freedom ?
true or not ?
only the commission is in a position to stop it .
the commission accepted that long ago .
that is not what it is about .
that is the reality .
we discuss these issues a great deal in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
that is part of democracy .
it has involved a great deal of discussion .
i also consider them to be a completely essential part of our culture .
what is the position ?
just come and see what the results are .
let us talk seriously now .
why ?
that is why , that is the reality .
that is a fact .
that is how the system was .
that is my experience .
may i ask you to do that ?
as i have already said , i will not do that !
the debate is already closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is the case !
why ?
perhaps you think about this once again .
welcome
thank you .
agenda
the order of business for today and tomorrow has been adopted .
however , the following changes have been proposed :
that has not happened .
i would therefore ask you to put my proposal to the house .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i welcome this proposal .
we should have had a proper debate !
( applause )
i cannot do that , it is against the rules of procedure .
i put the request for urgent procedure to the vote .
the commission of tomorrow
the next item is the communication by the commission on ' tomorrow 's commission ' .
it is now the turn of parliament and the council to play their part .
however , i must say a few words about it now as it has already become a matter of public debate .
this is something of a first in our organisation .
in this context , i must draw your attention to an important point .
we are therefore all responsible to some extent .
now , i would like to ask you : when do you want it by ?
you asked about information .
of course , that is important but it is also very important to have the will of the majority .
which must be implemented in 1999 .
we must implement the decisions which have been taken .
that is something i would like to make very clear .
this is perhaps what has happened with us . we have to some extent become victims of our own initiatives .
but nothing has happened .
those were the two questions i wanted to put to you .
there must be reasons for what happened .
we have never seen anything in that respect .
this is absolutely clear .
this applies in all countries .
i cannot see any reason why this should not happen .
the member states will not just be left with management powers .
mr president , i have two questions .
if so , would you be prepared to let the committee on budgetary control have them , in confidence of course ?
in reply to your second question , all i can say is that i do not know nothing about it and therefore cannot give you an answer .
however , as president of the commission , i cannot answer your question .
european council
employment remains the first priority .
here we can at last see a change for the better .
so more jobs were created in europe last year than in the united states .
we expect practical results to be achieved by the time of the european council .
europe has an important contribution to make in this respect .
good progress has been made with the enlargement process over the past five months .
firstly , an action plan to establish an area of freedom , security and justice .
obviously , i will start with enlargement .
let me begin with employment .
the first concerns the european investment bank .
clearly , investment is needed at present .
several countries have referred to the need for a dialogue with the european central bank .
the second priority is enlargement of the union .
welcome
i welcome them to the house .
what concerns them most is unemployment , as the minister said .
we have achieved much with the amsterdam treaty .
what about investment in europe ?
this decision must now to be taken .
one is the question of financial aspects of the agenda 2000 .
if the president of the council were here i would ask her what the strategy of the presidency is in this respect .
this is quite a major point .
it is not .
we would like to ask what is the position of the presidency on this ?
that is a difficult task .
we should try together to make this clear .
one of my colleagues mentioned it a moment ago .
but again parliament is not being asked for its opinion .
mr president , i have three things to say .
my second point concerns agenda 2000 , which is certainly an issue which is not going to go away .
my last point is that we should turn our attention to the issues of foreign policy , especially in relation to turkey .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i must begin with one general comment .
i believe the decision by parliament and by the commission and the council was the right one .
we must support it where we can .
i think that is an important point .
i think it should apply to other countries too .
one need only look at russia for an example of that .
the parliament has already approved all the new legislation needed for administrative reform .
of course we can only welcome this .
i refer you to the conclusions of the report on that point .
the rapporteur also referred to that .
there are two issues which must be of concern .
firstly , nuclear safety .
we must take action there .
it is one thing to adopt reforms and another thing to put them into practice .
i should like to make one more point .
mr president , i would like to draw the house 's attention to the issue of nuclear safety , which is one of agenda 2000 's priorities .
we welcome what is being done .
we welcome the commission 's reports .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a very important debate .
let me say this .
so we agree on that .
the joint debate is closed .
eu / turkey relations
this is the way forward .
turkey must respect the rights of all its citizens .
this means that we will have a clear list of the progress , or lack of it , that turkey has made on the political , economic and social requirements .
where before has such a thing ever been proposed ?
in what country ?
but what is the european union ?
i think this is something that turkey will have to understand .
what are those values ?
that is the point !
there is one further point which this report does not mention .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
equal pay for equal work .
that is just how things are , and they will be no different two years , five years or 20 years from now .
for that reason we must address the problem now .
why ?
so what are the other proposals ?
there is another reason .
that is why we are here .
that is also what i should like to say of this proposal .
that was the first success .
of course , it should not be so .
let us also be entirely open .
for me this is fundamental .
time is short .
in particular i congratulate the rapporteur .
he has done it .
he has done it with the colleagues and the committee of legal affairs .
overall we believe in equal work for pay of equal value .
mr president , i speak today on behalf of my group with regard to the proposal put before this house .
finally , i want to draw members ' attention to one other point .
mr president , to us and to every member of the european parliament , it is not the money which matters most .
european parliamentary office is an important office .
it will need to be more important still in future .
why such attention ?
what will the council do about it ?
it has our full support .
that is not what transparency is all about .
we do , however , have a good opportunity to improve the draft by means of amendments .
i hope we will be able to support other reforms which we can decide for ourselves .
obviously not .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there are many things in the european union that are still far from european .
this even applies to the european parliament .
under the terms of the proposal , our conditions would continue to be different .
i do not agree .
but it is good that it should not continue for longer than it needs to .
the debate is closed .
who should speak for the euro ?
but the union we have is an economic and monetary one .
it is not their job .
i will only give one example .
it will be there to provide information for ministers who speak for the community and nothing more .
that , however , must be our objective .
this cannot help our economy , especially as it comes under more and more pressure .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to thank the house for having included this item on the agenda .
let us discuss the form of the agreement .
there is an economic side and a monetary side .
the debate is closed .
monetary and financial crisis
we therefore welcome the approach proposed by the commission .
we need action .
the market too can have a share in this .
i should like to consider three important questions raised by your rapporteur .
why ?
the second question is what europe 's role should be .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
however , it is a serious matter .
so far , so good .
i think it will encourage the security service to continue its activities for the benefit of us all .
( the minutes were approved )
i would ask you to draw my attention to them then .
i should like to think that we can continue to call ourselves members of the european parliament .
what is your position ?
before the vote on the third part of article 4
after the vote on article 4
we do not put principles to the vote , especially if we have decided on a text .
this point is therefore closed .
that is the one and only reason !
that has to be possible !
this is a motion .
i cannot now go back on the vote .
mr president , may i try to help out here ?
we have not voted on that yet .
the vote has taken place , and we are not going back on it .
in this way , everyone can see how to vote .
i would say very clearly that i am not going back on what has happened .
mr president , what you have just done is very serious .
i can put that to the vote .
that is the text which i am going to put to the vote .
they cannot both be right .
may i draw your attention to one point .
we vote against part of the text .
it says :
i cannot do any more to make things clear and establish what the house 's decision is to be .
and what is this text ?
that is quite simply where we are .
i quite agree with you .
under this rule we should have had a financial statement , which we have not had .
that is not yet the case , however .
that means all cases of legislative initiative .
if necessary , we should have to vote again on article 5 .
moreover , it was an amendment tabled by your own political group , and you were in favour .
i shall ask the rapporteur for his opinion on this article , since i am in doubt here .
i should therefore like to hear the views of the rapporteur .
i wanted that to be made clear so as to avoid any doubt .
after the vote on paragraph 2
we shall therefore first vote on whether to put this compromise amendment to the vote .
if they were not - although i think they are - they would not be included .
no , we cannot go back on a compromise amendment by means of an addition , or in any other way .
before the vote on the motion for a resolution as a whole
but this request concerns the resolution as a whole .
let us be quite clear .
we cannot add something to it which did not form part of the compromise .
that is not a point of order .
it is my responsibility .
it will have the final say .
but this has been adopted .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
madam president , our group voted against because we want a clear and fair text .
i have a question i should like to ask .
we have had a rather trying morning .
i hope the council takes this into account .
i have a number of problems with the report .
people should also , as a matter of course , pay tax where they live - even members of the european parliament .
we voted against the report for these and other reasons .
the european parliament should have taken a decision on this long ago .
i am therefore voting against the proposed ' eu tax ' .
the fact that this was even a possibility is a serious matter .
it also means that this principle will have to be accepted in respect of community tax as well .
it is now up to the european council and the ministers responsible to make the next move .
for those reasons , we will vote against the report .
however , the european union is a political project , not an economic one .
what will be the response ?
significant progress is too long in coming .
i support this proposal and have voted in favour of the report .
and it seems that that is what will happen .
parliament has now come to the end of its agenda .
are there any comments ?
they therefore stand adopted .
i have parliament 's resolution .
( the minutes were approved )
agenda
i hope that it will be possible to vote tomorrow , at the end of the morning sitting .
you are quite right .
then we would not have a situation like this .
as article 1 states , at a later stage parliament will also follow the management of the programme .
i now have a final comment on the specific programmes which are going to be discussed in a moment .
there are a few comments i should like to make .
of course , the amount is not as high as parliament and the commission had proposed .
we view the commission 's proposal in a positive light .
the waste must certainly be brought under control . you are responsible on behalf of the people in this respect .
however , there must also be scope for fundamental research , which should be as independent and objective as possible .
are there any comments ?
who should decide ?
this is a question that i raised yesterday as a point of order .
this is not mentioned .
madam president , i would like to make a point relating to question time .
( the minutes were approved )
decision on urgent procedure
if not , i shall put it to the vote .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
i would therefore ask you to call members back so that they can take part in the vote .
thank you .
i am therefore in favour of it .
( applause )
the only question now is whether the commission has done enough to meet those five demands .
we hope that these amendments will be approved and that the necessary balance will be created .
however , to make this decision , we need to have the necessary information .
it is important for parliament to know this .
no , clearly not .
what can prevent them from doing so ?
( applause )
nor does it make any sense to say that we cannot be too hard on the commission in view of our own problems .
political and national elections are one thing , ladies and gentlemen ; our debate is another !
in such a case , however , i would like to see one or two others go as well .
it is completely unacceptable that two , three or four years should go by before political decisions are put into practice .
i think not .
need we go on ?
clearly everyone must take his or her own responsibility here and now .
that is not the issue at present .
those are the very words you used .
there would be no sense in such a move .
we in europe are always right and we in europe always act as we should .
( applause )
since this is not a point of order , you will have the floor at the end of the debate .
what can , what must the european parliament do to force the necessary changes ?
this may not be enough .
the european commission 's management can and must improve .
the answer is obviously that we should not .
that is wrong .
they do not always have an impact on the budget but it is still too high .
we must draw the right conclusion .
we need systems which control well and we must find these systems .
that is a major task .
this should include experience in both financial and human resources management .
you know what i mean .
for us , not all the work has been done .
many issues come from the past .
much remains to be done .
the debate is closed .
no one has it .
1999 general budget
i thank you all .
the 1999 budgetary procedure is coming to an end with the european parliament 's second reading .
i believe that we have reached an agreement that both parties can accept .
i would now like to look at what is , in my opinion , a serious political issue .
the commission then put forward the required proposals .
i believe that this is a basis for a successful europe !
i have prepared an amendment to the motion to this effect on behalf of my group , and hope that it will also meet with the agreement of the house .
i should also like to make a second comment .
finally , i am pleased that the council has also agreed to increase the budget for consumer and health policy .
as a committee we have not achieved everything that we wanted to achieve but , at the end of the day , we have achieved a budget that we can certainly live with .
i do , however , have a number of concerns .
i would like to express my thanks once again to the general rapporteur .
it has been an extremely successful budget procedure .
thank you , mr president-in-office .
it is now voting time .
not everyone can say the same .
we voted against this report .
madam president , the 1999 general budget for the european union is the last budget which will be adopted by this parliament .
the committee on budgets has made that very clear to the commission .
they will remain after this budget for the future .
i hope for the best for the future .
we are left with the problem of what to do .
madam president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur for all her hard work on this report .
last year , it was clear that there was not enough money left in the social fund at the end of the year , and the same thing is going to happen this year .
some people , including our own rapporteur , said that a new culture is developing .
but then the question of whether we agreed under the treaty was a different matter .
with or without an institutional agreement .
but it is not technical for the public .
we have achieved this .
the agenda 2000 resolutions will be vital for the budgets over the coming years .
i know what is going to happen now .
but has parliament actually achieved anything ?
one final point on the structural funds .
that is a matter of principle .
but we have shown this .
we have done our part of the work .
the debate is closed .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , 1999 will be the last year of this commission .
it will also be the first year of the euro .
i , too , believe that the internal reform of the commission , as i have already said , is a priority for 1999 and i will come back to it later .
i will begin with agenda 2000 .
as a result , 1999 is the year of decisions .
madam president , another priority for 1999 is the creation of the area of freedom , security and justice .
we need to encourage the member states to become aware of this need , and this will again be another of the commission 's priorities in 1999 .
i would like to mention , in particular , a number of key points .
the first is public health .
on the one hand , there are the institutional reforms themselves .
why is this necessary ?
there are , in fact , three .
i will hand these on to the next president .
we each have our own role to play .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , these are the main issues in our 1999 programme .
moreover , why are the proposals that did not see the light of day in 1998 not then included in the 1999 programme ?
very little has been done .
there is a problem there that you must be aware of .
i would now like to move on to your 1999 programme .
the second priority is the treaty of amsterdam .
that is a point that we should also like to stress .
but i do not think that this was the problem .
that is what i think .
you have made a number of proposals that i agree with .
you did not say anything about this in your speech .
so i think we have a lot to do here .
secondly , i am concerned about growth , employment and all our efforts in the social field .
i am concerned about food safety and everything to do with it .
what progress are we making there ?
i should like to hear what the commission has to say about these comments and questions .
the second point concerns the political context .
firstly , where is europe going ?
i see no such response in your text , nor did i hear it in your speech .
mr president , mr president of the commission , allow me to address a number of issues .
and the right direction , mr president , can only be to set a course towards the process of european integration .
there is also amsterdam to consider .
then there are the wto negotiations for the year 2000 .
and what if europe wanted to be european ?
thank you very much .
there is just one problem .
but employment is not and cannot be the only issue .
social policy is more than just labour market policy .
i wish you every success with this .
the key word is agenda 2000 .
the key word of transparency should not remain simply a word ; we also need actually to put this transparency into practice .
instead , you should say that you will propose specific legislation in the year 2000 .
and i could continue .
clearly , you have already put up with enough of that today .
i will stop there .
i believe that we will do all we can to ensure that this programme can be implemented , for reasons that you know very well , because 1999 will be an important year .
some of you have also raised the matter of the reform of the commission .
under the new treaty of amsterdam , however , the president of the commission will have an entirely different role to the one he currently has .
agenda 2000 is the main issue .
i still believe that the political will does exist and i am very pleased to see that it is there .
we have put forward a number of proposals on this subject and we must work on them .
it is therefore in our interest to develop political dialogue with the us .
the third point raised is , of course , employment .
the debate is closed .
at the moment , i cannot give you an answer .
the only thing i can say is that it is now time for questions to the commission to begin .
question time ( commission )
we really have , therefore , taken every possible measure .
we cannot do any more .
if they do not , then you cannot make up for it .
we really cannot do any more than that .
i should like to ask the commissioner where we are with this matter .
the commission is taking this issue very seriously .
commissioner , i welcome your reply and thank you for the work i know you have done .
two years on , still no action .
and we have to say that some results have been achieved .
this is one key point .
this principle is obviously in force .
since then a number of important actions have been taken .
thank you very much for your question .
this is the best way of making progress with these questions .
action is needed at both national and eu levels .
and in what respect has this been considered ?
i welcome the commissioner 's reply .
people like it .
if there were , obviously we would have problems and would act .
that is not the case .
as far as i and my services can see today , that is not the case .
there is no doubt on that point .
once again , we welcome the government 's policy , on the whole .
this must be clear .
that is the stage we are at now .
thank you , commissioner .
that may have been the case - it does happen .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his reply .
i shall return to the subject later .
information strategy on euro
what does this mean ?
all these issues concern us particularly as members of this european parliament .
the same is true in other countries too .
the problem is , however , that most countries have not yet taken a decision on that .
the point of no return has been reached .
it must take into account questions raised between now and then .
some countries will need more while in certain cases more is already being done .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is really what my report is about .
so the commission and the council have to get their act together .
why ?
so what can we do ?
in that respect , we do not support the proposal .
we do not believe this .
it does not go far enough but , having said that , it is the only report possible at the present time .
we need a guarantee fund and instruments of stability .
however , this was not the case .
the scope of this text is very clear .
we will be making proposals in this respect before or during 1999 .
he has said nothing on that .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i hope that the commission will follow us .
it is a small step but a good one , and above all it is a step in the right direction .
i will now turn to the second proposal , on which the council has not made a decision .
you may only ask a question .
mr president , i must tell the commissioner that we can reach agreement .
the debate is closed .
several of these have been adopted by the council , in whole or in part .
two important points remain which i think need to be raised again .
firstly , an administrative note .
as regards the two amendments , and firstly the transparency of the decisions taken by the committee , this has been a matter of concern for a number of years now , not least to parliament itself .
i hope the house will support the amendments we have tabled .
of course they are talking .
i welcome this report .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i congratulate the rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
it is a very necessary report .
it is absolutely necessary that we do this .
that is one aspect of it .
the parliament agreed the ban in the first place along with the committee on fisheries .
of course this cannot be put into effect until the ban itself comes into effect and we believe we should let the position stand .
this is a first step in the right direction .
i would also ask the commission what additional control measures it will be taking ?
my other points concerns the motion for a resolution .
it now has an opportunity to do so .
the debate is closed .
i would stress that these conditions have been established by the committee on budgets and accepted by the committee on agriculture , and are , in my opinion , of great interest .
this was based on an amendment proposed by our committee .
the united states are of the same opinion as concerns their food aid programme .
therefore the commission cannot include these products in the current food aid programme .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , we discussed this matter at yesterday 's meeting of the committee on budgetary control .
we have always given strong support to animal protection and consumer protection in this house .
if she does not wish to try it , then she does not have to turn up !
i do not know .
that is all i can say .
( the minutes were approved )
welcome
the next item is the joint debate on :
the second point is enlargement .
the third point is monetary union .
we now have this action plan for the common area of freedom , security and justice .
one central issue was and still is the question of employment .
on the whole , the objective was achieved .
you are aware that the commission had presented a communication on public investment within the framework of the economic strategy .
i believe that there are four main aspects .
the first is to promote employment , economic growth and stability , as i have already mentioned .
the second is to improve security and the quality of life .
the third is to reform the union 's policies and institutions .
why have we heard nothing about it ?
the 1999 budget and the research and development programme have been mentioned already .
i very much hope the change will be a positive one .
i think that is quite essential .
we discussed important issues together .
we know that .
there are now decisions in this area , not just discussions .
mr president , i would like to thank both the president of the european council and the president-in-office for their reports here this morning .
we offer our thanks .
it is political will that matters .
amsterdam did that .
and you did that .
together we can do that .
i would like to mention just a few issues concerning third countries .
this is a good idea .
that is true , but that was not your job .
believe me , they can do it better !
this is the case with the reform of the institutions .
whether this was a summit that set a new course , only the future can tell .
what are we going to do with our children ?
where shall we put them ?
how can we guarantee their integration into society ?
i would like to address a second point , employment policy .
this would mean a reduction in the eu budget over time .
what has come through is that there were negotiations about money .
perhaps that was a better system .
we are very much in favour of that , and parliament must do the same , but so must the council .
when , then , mr president ?
that is the way it is !
what does that mean ?
there will always be national interests in europe , just as there are also different regional interests in each member state .
in those areas that i follow - foreign affairs and defence - it is my view that real progress has been made .
( applause )
the good thing now in the european union is that we try to work together to improve society .
but we also need to stress to the us that we need fair trade .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
recent events have shown that this does not work .
i cannot support all of this resolution .
we thank the rapporteur for this important report .
nevertheless , i note today that agreement has been reached on the 1999 employment policy guidelines .
the same applies to enlargement .
unfortunately , the president-in-office said nothing about that .
this is a political decision .
there is nothing further we can add .
but we have had enough discussions now .
the debate is closed .
human rights in the world
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i believe the european union has the means and the instruments to act .
but we also need political will .
i wish to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report .
this has been approved in the report .
i have just one or two points to make .
i have some comments concerning the legal aspect .
then there is the political aspect .
really , i give up .
we must keep it up .
people want to see an end to it , they want no more children going to war .
but what is the real situation ?
now we must make efforts to ensure that it does so .
because a successful fight for human rights is a contribution to peace - and we all have a right to peace .
why ?
naturally , we agree with the priorities set for human rights .
this is a case in point .
why is there such violence against women ?
of course not .
respect for human rights must , however , begin here at home .
that is the very nature of the human rights issue .
human rights are now a priority objective in our external relations and our development cooperation .
other partners include the international organisations .
we shall do that as well .
the next commission will certainly need to try to improve matters there .
dialogue and institutional cooperation are necessary if we really want results .
the joint debate is closed .
human rights in the union
did we have anything to do with it ?
i do not know whether we did or not .
i simply welcome the result .
this european approach to human rights should lead to progress in a number of areas .
the first of these rights is the right to life .
i believe it is essential that this report be voted through .
clearly , however , we need to agree what all of this means .
what should we do ?
i see no point in discussing this matter any further .
we must of course set a good example within the union and provide the best possible protection for these rights .
question time ( council )
ladies and gentlemen , in today 's questions to the council there are several groups of questions .
only then can and should we take the appropriate measures .
at present , there is no commission proposal or communication on the matter before the council .
i welcome the president-in-office 's reply .
i should like to thank the president-in-office of the council for her answer .
i believe it is possible .
that is my answer , mr president .
i should like the president-in-office to answer three questions .
thank you !
that is what i wanted to say .
that is what i have to say in reply .
but i believe that nevertheless at this point we must continue along that road .
but i have already said all that .
to date , the council has received no proposals on the matter raised by the honourable member in his question .
for 12 years i have been trying to make the council and the commission aware of this issue .
in the light of that , i am sure you will allow me to refer you to one of the basic principles of european union action .
much remains to be done .
without his efforts and his authority over the past 12 months , we would have achieved much less progress .
nevertheless , it remains to be seen how that plan is implemented .
in general , we support the amendments tabled by that group , as well as those tabled by the rapporteur .
this does not exist in all countries , but should be seriously considered .
unfortunately , i do not have time to discuss this .
it is not really good enough any more .
there are other amendments to come which are in my opinion unacceptable , at least in the context of a discussion on human rights .
the protection of the young , ladies and gentlemen - those of you who call for it - is in my view a human right .
this goes against the european convention on human rights .
to respect the law ?
so what is just ?
unfortunately , very often this is just talk .
the debate is closed .
but who are they ?
there are two or three aspects that i see as important .
i would like to draw your attention to two aspects that are going to be subject to amendments .
and that is quite something , i think .
on behalf of my group , i should like to focus on two things which are most important to myself and to the group .
my first point is that not just some of us , but all of us are concerned about our citizens ' safety .
but that is quite another matter .
these are important issues .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , all the european institutions talk about the citizens ' europe .
this is acceptable thus far .
i consider this to be unacceptable .
i know that one group is now against this .
this is an amendment tabled by our group .
we do not think that is necessary .
i would like to mention one final point .
mr president , i believe that the idea behind this directive is a good one .
reduction in price would be very difficult to agree .
the debate is closed .
we must be able to do something about this .
it would only make the data more difficult to use .
that is the reason why we cannot accept this amendment .
but naturally such standards can be created .
we shall therefore start on the technical work which this requires .
however , we shall do what we can , and we agree that it would be good if we could get these changes implemented .
the debate is closed .
there are four instruments .
in this respect , i welcome the rapporteur 's amendment , and i fully support it in order to achieve a little more transparency for the consumer .
this idea is not a new one .
i shall now give the reasons why we cannot accept some of the other amendments .
we cannot accept this .
the debate is closed .
the result is nevertheless a very important one .
this proposal is a step in the right direction .
so the commission cannot go as far as the european parliament might like at the present moment in some areas .
and now i will give some of the reasons why we cannot accept the other amendments .
the commission therefore cannot accept these amendments now .
it will be some time before this is the case .
the debate is closed .
agenda
are there any comments from any other groups ?
mr president , you know as well as i do that this is a very urgent and very recent issue .
i have no problem with that .
the house must decide the changes to the agenda .
i am sure there will be no problem but the house must decide .
we do not at this point need a resolution .
in the circumstances , it would be appropriate to have a debate without resolution .
i shall put to the vote the question concerning the motion for a resolution .
i shall open the vote to establish precisely whether or not a motion for a resolution would be appropriate .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
nevertheless , it is important that we should at least hear what the president-in-office has to say .
is that so ?
' the proposal for a decision shall be put to the vote before the motion for a resolution .
mr president , that is precisely what i said .
we have a decision and a resolution .
we do not agree with this .
on the basis of our rules of procedure , this means that the matter must be referred back to the committee on budgetary control and the debate must continue between parliament and the commission .
i would also add that we as a group have every confidence in the president of the european commission .
i should like to end by making the following point .
that would be the right thing to do .
( applause from the right )
we find such action unacceptable .
we do not believe these are the same thing at all .
finally , on the political question .
we are not all in agreement .
mr president , i have two comments .
mrs green , this is not the time to continue with this subject .
let us see you vote for it then - those of you who have voted for this .
this is not the time for a debate on a matter which is not on the agenda .
you can have that debate at the proper time .
after an important vote members will draw their own conclusions and will adopt their political position .
i say the same to the rapporteur .
it has been referred back to committee .
in the committee you will continue as the rapporteur .
we need to do that before we can refer this back to committee .
i did not make the rules , but that is what they say .
we cannot vote again .
it will go back to the committee now .
that is the only course of action available .
i will not allow more debate on that question .
the committee on budgetary control has not , however , done so .
they could have done this some time ago already and now the rules stand as they are and must be applied as such .
the commission discussed yesterday whether it should make a statement only after the vote .
the position is the same .
you are not aware of this , but it is the case .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we are very pleased about this .
this is why we did not vote for this second reading by parliament , it being a step towards additional expenditure .
we know what we want in future .
'
'
therefore we cannot support them .
there was no final vote , since the report was referred back to committee .
look at what you voted on .
many people doubt that they will .
in reality , they are only increasing them .
we cannot continue to go about things in this way .
' .
however , defence issues should , in our view , continue to be decided at national level .
it takes up a number of principles and values which form the basis of the work carried out by parliament in the area of human rights .
in this respect too , their particular idea of what is right and wrong seems to me to come and go .
' in everything , do to others what you would have them do to you . '
i should like to know when that will now take place .
agenda
during the discussion one group was not prepared to allow the vote without debate .
as you know , all groups must agree on such a procedure .
but what we do not want is a vote on something that has not been discussed .
if we are to have a vote then we must have a debate .
before there was only one group taking that position . now there is another group which does not want to vote without previous debate .
people would then feel that they had the opportunity to deal with it .
do you think it is necessary to vote on the proposal ?
i do not think so .
the next item is the statement by the commission on the situation in iraq .
the third point concerns humanitarian aid .
let me return to the point i made at the beginning .
we know he has used it against his own people . we have every reason to believe he will use it against other people .
the second question we must address ourselves to is : was this the right time ?
and yet we know that the next six months are going to be crucial for that policy .
but it has an even more urgent impact .
we act because we must . '
why ?
so what can we do to help achieve some progress in the region ?
but the eu could nevertheless make an effort in this direction .
the only form i can see this taking at present is humanitarian aid .
this is the reality of the situation .
this , mr president , is the true state of affairs .
where is the security council 's resolution ?
long live iraq .
the debate is closed .
if we do that , i believe we shall have done what is best for ourselves too .
the debate is closed .
international organisations such as the union also have an important role to play .
that is why it is so important that we stop this practice .
it requires cooperation at international level .
the commission has a responsibility .
europe has a responsibility .
this is a very important resolution .
it is a very good resolution .
this is the key .
then we can implement it across the union .
but i do not think this is the time to go further into such matters .
this resolution today is the least we could do .
the debate is closed .
welcome
but the european union must also support global agreements .
there is one positive aspect .
i am rather pleased about that , because we do not often mention it .
and they are sure to be here now .
we must keep up the pressure .
we should not give them the opportunity to do so .
but it is not enough .
i do not know the country .
our information is again very different .
we call for action by the commission and the council .
i therefore hope that the commission and the council will see the situation in the same light as this parliament .
but this is no solution to the present problem .
that is why i believe that we in the european union must do all in our power to put a stop to this .
we should therefore ask the un to apply itself to this matter and step up its action .
the joint debate is closed .
no , mr president .
let 's not have a debate .
the amendment is clear .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
on a point of order , mr president .
the system is in crisis .
however , much more remains to be done .
i have therefore not voted in favour of the report in the final vote .
with respect to the resolution , i wish to draw members ' attention to a number of points .
this is important .
this is what is difficult .
it would be a good idea to view this as a european issue too .
only then can a directive be a good directive .
finally , there is the role of the social partners .
this remains a vital issue for the future of europe .
mr president , the rapporteur is right in saying that the commission 's action plan is not specific enough .
why are all the other european parties taking so long ?
little remains of this view in this resolution .
to my mind , there are three important requirements .
we must not do that !
why ?
the time has come when the government and this house have to face up to the reality .
the debate is closed .
these are the main points i wanted to make .
how we get there , however , is where we do not agree .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this is extremely urgent , commissioner .
the form and content of the text must be of a high quality .
the joint debate is closed .
ladies and gentlemen , i should like to welcome you to the last sitting of 1998 .
are there any comments ?
i referred to this yesterday .
we take note of that .
all we have are the results of the vote in part 1 of the minutes .
the problem is that there was no final vote .
they stand adopted , and that is what it says in the minutes .
that has already been done , and that will be the last time for this year .
( applause )
however , i wanted to refer to yesterday 's minutes .
that should therefore be made clear .
( the minutes were approved )
madam president , on behalf of my group i welcome this commission report and hope that it is accepted today with my proposed amendments .
other states were involved before and others are involved now .
but the objectives too are different .
he rightly states that education is an essential part of the development of these countries .
we need more money for this programme and all education programmes to make them a reality , for the new member states in particular .
for all these reasons we should support this programme .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we have already seen this in the past .
i hope that the council and the commission will support me in this approach and , commissioner , i would also like you to give me the commission 's opinion .
due to an administrative problem , it was not included .
i also wish to take this opportunity to note that the question of resources is very important .
this is an important issue .
it is an excellent report , and we do not have too many excellent reports .
i believe this is one of the most important issues .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
before the vote on the draft legislative resolution
i would like to know whether this is the case .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
what conclusions can we draw from this ?
clearly that is necessary for a single market .
if all member states have to agree , it may take rather longer before a decision comes .
if that is case , i should like to hear it from the commissioner .
if you start something , you have to see it through .
today we are going a stage further .
to a great extent , the single market has become a reality .
mr president , i welcome this report .
as you know , a lot of work is being done in those areas .
ladies and gentlemen , the action programme for the single market is now in the last few days of its implementation .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
thank you , mr president !
the change of government in germany has made this possible within the eu .
parliament has now come to the end of its agenda .
i would therefore like to offer them a special word of thanks .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
the following amendments have been proposed .
could i ask the president of the commission if he is in agreement with this procedure ?
the president of the commission agreed to this proposal
parliament approved the proposal
voting is not a technical act , but one of great political importance .
i put the request from the green group to the vote .
brussels
the next item is the joint debate on :
the president of the commission will speak after that , and then we shall continue with the debate .
if it is not , then we should decide so now .
so be it !
my group has done more than its fair share in this respect and we will support every effort to continue .
we may wish we had .
but at present we do not have such a right .
applause
applause
applause
we think that is important and i will come back to it .
applause
because that is what this is all about .
we risk a major political crisis .
so this is , in the true sense of the word , a debate on parliament 's confidence in the commission .
we cannot put down a motion of confidence .
applause
take the euro .
so it is not your political actions which are in question here .
applause
applause
applause
why should that be the case for the european commission ?
some will answer : ' but that is the law ' .
the commission has no legal right , as has been said , to do that .
this is a reason , according to some , for giving the commission a vote of confidence .
applause
there have been others during this parliamentary term .
that is the problem .
applause from the green group
applause
applause
this was a significant new step along the road towards european integration .
let me return to the idea of confidence , mr president ,
there is much to be done .
let us continue along this road together .
i refer to the negotiations on agenda 2000 .
this too is a question of confidence .
that was a serious matter then .
so we have to reach agreement .
action has to follow .
it is the commission 's job to put its house in order .
i shall make it public and will forward it to the european parliament .
my second point concerns priorities and the resources available to implement them .
many measures have been taken or are currently under way .
if there is one area where we have to work hand in hand , this is it .
let us discuss it .
applause
applause
applause
but i want to show good will , because we all need a strong commission .
we want and we need a strong commission !
applause
applause
i was pleased to hear you say you will accept your share of the responsibility .
i would like to hear rather more of that .
applause
and we need clear proposals for change .
but the crisis is not always used to make a new beginning .
applause
i still believe that together we can achieve this .
we could not help but feel that way , and we did .
what is the position regarding the others ?
applause
you said we are to work together .
applause
applause
applause
parliament cannot force them to speak .
applause
applause
why is this ?
this is our question , and we naturally want an answer .
i have a question , however .
i would like to ask whether other members of the commission are also prepared to accept a share of the responsibility ?
so what does the commission do , what does the commission president do ?
applause
do what has to be done .
applause
there is only one direct course of action which you take .
let us talk about responsibility .
but we are not concerned with a political assessment here .
thank you for giving me the floor , mr president .
but there is one thing i would like to point out .
that is what i did .
it is a fact .
let us discuss it .
but part of the work has been done .
part of it still needs to be done .
i may have done things which in policy terms were wrong .
applause
the debate is closed .
applause
applause
applause
the fight against unemployment is the most urgent concern of the people of europe .
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
so why do we want to carry on with integration ?
applause
where do we need more or perhaps less europe ?
we will all have to consider them .
firstly , europe needs more democracy .
applause
applause
applause
we want to take the initiative here during our presidency .
applause
applause
everything , or almost everything , has already been said on this subject .
agenda 2000 is one of these .
my second example is that of our relations with russia , that great country which , despite its present difficulties , will always remain a great country .
applause
the president-in-office referred to resources .
applause
let us encourage the people of central europe !
applause
we would ask you to take that into account !
mr president-in-office of the council , we wish you success during your presidency , for your success is europe 's success .
applause
i wish you every success there .
applause
there can be no doubt about that .
we have seen that this week .
applause
mr president-in-office , i want to welcome you and your presidency on behalf of my group .
we have confidence in you , mr president-in-office .
we have just heard you speak .
let me return to the financial aspect of agenda 2000 .
of course , i know europe must be based on solidarity .
i know that a compromise has to be found .
we do not question that .
i will do that at the end of the debate .
let me to start with the current situation .
applause
applause
to come back to agenda 2000 .
that will have to be the basis on which parliament and the member states must reach agreement .
mr president-in-office of the council , let me say a few words in regard to the discussions in our member states and to the internal political debate in our own country .
that is simply not on !
applause
so do give us a little help here .
that is not the only reason for the reform , let us be clear about that !
let me also say a few words on this institutional reform .
what does the european idea mean ?
that is a difficult process .
this has to stop !
applause
you cannot go on like that !
applause
mr president , on a point of order .
so how can you draw such a conclusion ?
colleagues , i always welcome this kind of debate , but it should not go on for too long .
what reforms are needed in agriculture ?
what problems from the past need dealing with ?
applause
that is a majority .
but there is more to social policy than this .
i believe this presidency has made an excellent contribution in this respect .
we find ourselves at present in a special situation .
let me thank you most particularly for your words on institutional reform .
applause
that is certainly one example .
in this parliament i speak for my group for environmental policy , consumer protection and health policy .
i know that the general public often do not know how legislation is made in the european union .
in fact they are not quite sure how it is made in their own member states either .
but transparency also means that it must be clear what the member states do with the eu legislation once they have approved it .
applause
you know and we know that some of the member states are more concerned , and rightly so , about the problem of the financial contribution .
what a number of people in europe do not understand is rural development policy , agricultural policy .
applause
we hope so .
is this the right approach ?
i think not .
let us hope for success .
in my opinion , the wrong question is being asked .
the european parliament has already come out in favour of the cohesion fund , as did the european commission when it considered the matter .
finally , enlargement is a major issue .
to return to our debate , i just want to go into one point , the question of kosovo .
where is that step in a political direction you referred to a moment ago ?
for there is nothing they can do where they are .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , i too want to speak on the subject of kosovo .
a final word in connection with what you said about russia .
now we finally need political agreement within the council .
europe cannot allow that to happen .
quite obviously it is not strong enough yet .
we will have to find an answer to this quickly .
we want europe !
we have common interests .
there is no doubt at all that germany 's political approach is a european one .
under the new government , germany will continue its commitment to europe .
applause
there are no changes here .
applause
that will not do europe any good , nor for that matter will it do the stability of our currency any good .
that is a key point .
i think we are all aware of that responsibility .
applause
this is a central aspect of the necessary structural reforms .
that is a point that will certainly be taken seriously in the discussions .
the political decision is taken at brussels .
that is the second important point .
we have to discuss them .
and then there are the structural funds and the cohesion fund .
the european parliament must play a central role here .
with the best will in the world , we were not able to do so .
applause
applause
today the situation is different .
thank you very much , mr president-in-office .
the debate is closed .
transparency in the european union
however , we need not go any further into this , since it is all in the report .
it would be appropriate for me to end with a comment on this .
the citizens of europe have a right to that .
much remains to be done .
yet we should not go quite as far as most of the amendments , especially amendment no 4 .
when are we to see some action , and what principles will be included ?
the rapporteur points out that greater transparency is vital for the future of the european union .
i should like to go further on this point .
as regards the commission president , i should like to make one small comment .
it is a good start , although it does not go far enough .
they must not even say anything to the european parliament , because it is not in our interests to hear what goes on in the commission .
my group will vote for their report .
that is the real aim .
applause
i should like to refer to several key aspects of the resolution .
action has been taken in this regard .
the debate is closed .
so the rapporteur is quite right to question our own system .
who makes the rules ?
that is all very well .
are we trying hard enough to make our work public ?
how can we improve that ?
we need to make progress on all these points .
this is another reason for the union to set an example !
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission is still present in the house and is today taking part in our debate , which i feel is right .
europe needs this rule .
or does the president of the commission have to be a member of parliament , and , if so , why ?
much has happened since then .
we must find the balance .
it must come about as soon as possible .
there is no question about that .
the debate is closed .
clearly , we believe it to be unacceptable .
i would like to end , mr president , with two important comments .
under the proposed system we have no power as parliament to discuss the intergovernmental decision .
what we want to see - and that is the objective - is a greater guarantee of quality .
under the new proposal each country will have its turn in future , according to a given order .
mr president , a great deal has already been said , and i will not go over everything again .
the debate is closed .
europe agreements
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
that is very important to the stability of europe as a whole .
this also applies to competition policy .
this date is now long past .
these measures must also be brought into line by the end of 1999 .
mr president , as rapporteur i thank the committee on external economic relations for its effective cooperation and i would like to present my conclusions .
under these circumstances we must consider whether we can simply take the same approach to all of them .
they too need to be discussed .
but we also have to ask what more we can do .
we must not allow that to happen .
these small but important issues have yet to be put right .
i should like to support this view .
but may i just make one point .
i do not think that this would be good for them .
mr president , i too wish to stress that those four reports can have a positive effect .
i believe that such comments are necessary in a debate such as we are now having .
this was what happened within the european union itself .
as you all well know , even today there remain a great many problems within the european union .
the basic rules have already been agreed under the europe agreements , what we are now discussing is their implementation .
finally , i should like to make a point about state aid .
we also had to do this .
it takes time and money .
the countries know this .
one final word on this , ladies and gentlemen . there is at present still a great need for more transparency .
that is clear .
we do not have any direct responsibility here .
we have to talk to each other , even when it is a question of aid .
the debate is closed .
i also found that there were certain human rights problems .
this must be made quite clear in the committee on external economic relations .
unfortunately , european industry does not take that view .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
my question is therefore : how many countries have still not implemented the directive ?
i should like to start with the last question .
we see no reason why we should in any way change these objectives at this time .
i should like to thank the commissioner for his response .
therefore , it is not for the commission to rule on this matter .
thank you , commissioner .
i cannot give you any other answer at the moment .
i do think , however , that we can do better than we are doing at present .
as a result , i referred the matter to the legal service .
this is the situation in which we now find ourselves .
' this is how things stand at the moment .
i cannot do more than has already been done .
you may ask what other course of action is open to me .
thank you , commissioner .
action should be taken .
i am sure she would support that point of view .
however , i would ask him to go further .
are you aware of this , commissioner , and can you do anything about it ?
that is the position , madam , as i am sure you know .
i should like to thank the commissioner .
i am aware of parliament 's position , but i would ask you to consider that that is the very purpose of institutional dialogue .
it is also up to the member states to address themselves to this matter .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
we are still discussing what is the best way .
thank you , commissioner .
it is for this reason that we must now go further .
this is the only solution .
this would be an excellent proposal if the union had any powers in this field .
it is high time we implemented them , but how ?
as a result , the assessment of the union 's policy is , in principle , a positive one , taking into account that we need time to develop the programmes .
that is the only request we have received .
this is an issue that should be discussed within the european union .
finally , i must point out that this debate is far from over .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
that is our first priority .
you should do that more often .
that is why we ask the commission to carry on working with the current legislation .
this means there is no guarantee that the system will always be available .
there is , however , one problem , which is the question of funding .
but there has been no progress in that direction either .
i would stress two further points here .
in short , it is within our means .
this too should be given due consideration .
we therefore have no need to support the new amendments .
i should now like to put a specific question to the commission .
this position is also in line with that of the council .
so now and then we should also try to do so through political decisions .
i should like to make five points .
naturally i am very much aware that europe could decide to have no system at all .
mr president , the same goes for me .
i would welcome that .
the debate is closed .
i believe parliament could live with it .
that is why the draft directive that the commission presented to parliament last year was such a welcome development .
mr president , commissioner , a great deal has already been said about the importance of this issue .
we are therefore pleased that the rapporteur has carried out his work so quickly .
so i look forward to that .
a central issue in the directive is legal effect .
first of all , i should like to thank the rapporteur .
the report has been of great assistance to us .
we have also been able to accept a good number of amendments .
in the end , we did not make any progress at that council meeting .
on the technology question i have already said what i think .
the debate is closed .
this is a matter of some concern to us in parliament and so we have tabled 11 amendments to the common position .
we know more research is needed and that it is under way .
we must therefore look at air quality in general , and not just at the situation in specific areas .
it is not enough to say that it is simply not possible .
what is required is a strong political will .
but some day the people of europe will call them to account .
i am pleased about that .
we are also able to support amendments nos 3 and 4 .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
that is all i wanted to say .
are there any other comments ?
there are not .
the minutes were approved
we had a meeting yesterday and discussed what action should be taken .
agenda 2000
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
if agriculture policy changes , the funding of it naturally has to change as well .
what , in the view of the agriculture committee , should not be in the guarantee fund ?
all the structural measures under objective 1 and community initiatives .
management of the funds must of course remain under the control of the commission itself .
the agriculture committee has tabled a number of amendments to improve things here .
we want the commission to report to us on this every three months .
i am not , therefore , giving my own opinion or that of my group , but that of the committee .
the impact of these changes was , of course , considerable .
that would be the level set by brussels .
applause
you are well aware that i do not do that .
i may be wrong , but i do not do it !
those are my comments on the agricultural side .
applause
in addition , there is an important internal debate on what society demands of agriculture .
crucial here are , however , the positive effects which the reform will have on the economy .
let me now turn to the individual amendments you have proposed .
i can certainly support any efforts to find new markets for agricultural products in industry .
we should not , therefore , accept changes of this kind .
i can only comment on the main aspects of the changes here .
that applies just as much to the social as to the environmental criteria .
that is why it does not make sense .
applause
that might mean , however , that after the vote we have to ask you once again whether you can accept the amendments .
we have indeed come a long way together in this respect .
we cannot accept that .
i know the commissioner is aware of this .
what funding is available for agriculture ?
that concerns germany in particular .
this should not be supported with public money .
more should be done here !
we wanted to reach a compromise .
we are in agreement with that support .
we should not go down that road .
perhaps he should show them to me .
can you ?
it is european culture at its best and high quality food always has its own price .
there are at least three reasons for this .
we have the means to do so .
is this really your aim ?
is this really our aim ?
agenda 2000 also requires us to provide for enlargement to include countries of the east .
this situation is unacceptable , commissioner .
for me , the commission 's proposals on agriculture go too far .
i have a few comments to make .
i have taken note of the second point .
parliament adopted the resolution
we have decided not to support this report .
i hope the council of ministers will also take parliament 's position seriously .
human rights and labour rights , on the other hand , are no longer mentioned by those in favour .
why is this the case ?
and this is a good thing .
we have to have standards for trade .
we are all agreed on that .
mr president , by way of a point of order , i have a request to make .
what form does the commission propose the reform should take ?
this is the first time i have said that to the commission .
i do not , i live in the country , but i am well aware that this is so .
it is not right that a few members and the commission are speaking on behalf of farmers .
there are currently no problems with production , commissioner .
what you have to do is propose an end to all the production aid .
enough is enough !
commissioner , we have already established a european agricultural model .
we have tabled amendments to a number of the proposals which have been put forward in parliament .
we also have some other amendments .
mr president , commissioner , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , the development of the common agricultural policy is a concern for all of us .
the second point i would like to discuss concerns the employment situation in rural areas .
agricultural policy demands reform .
mr president , i also wish to welcome the president-in-office of the council .
i am quite sure that he is well aware of that situation and will make sure that we are in a strong position for those wto negotiations .
i should like to air one or two things which have already been said .
this means that the course for a successful financial reform must be set now in the context of the negotiations on the common agricultural policy .
in conclusion , we need reform .
this cannot be allowed .
the time for questions is long past .
but to achieve the same result with less and less money is , in my view , a very difficult task .
perhaps this reform is the last available .
then we will be in agreement .
i welcome that .
i would like to add the following .
we must discuss whether this makes sense for the future of agriculture .
applause
but i do not know what he said on this issue so i cannot comment .
i would like to discuss this with him .
the result would be a great waste of resources if this were not the case .
but perhaps we should also discuss this more in public than we have done in the past .
a great deal has been said about the extent to which agricultural policy must also be social policy .
the debate is closed .
but i do hope that it will not be necessary to go that far .
i fully agree with you on this .
so here we must be prepared to reach a compromise .
this is far from being the case with animal products .
certainly not all countries will be able to start at the same time .
but that is not the issue here .
that is it , really .
it is now 1999 , and as the president-in-office said earlier , all we have to do now is to adopt it .
what is the current situation ?
we are now at the stage of the legislative procedure where parliament has adopted a position on this issue .
the commission has adopted some of parliament 's amendments .
so what should be done ?
but perhaps it is already in the text .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
there is an internal council document which was to be discussed .
they may not be able to achieve that .
the same , to some extent , applies to parliament .
you are aware of the current situation .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
from the council 's point of view , it cannot say anything further on this matter at the present time .
i really think this is a good start .
we would really like to thank you for that .
it could not be found .
i therefore share your concern in this matter .
i would like the council to pay due attention to those two conditions .
however , i also believe that it would be better to address your question to the commission .
the last time was yesterday .
mr president , the council 's position on this issue is clear .
i thank the president-in-office for his reply .
i agree that it is very difficult .
we consider it to be quite an important matter .
we will also have other opportunities to discuss this issue during our presidency , and also with the countries in the region .
it must firstly be discussed in the council , and only then can such a decision be made .
opportunities for the future can of course also be created through structural change , as you know very well .
this is a really important objective of the union 's regional and structural policy , in the opinion of the presidency at least .
in order to achieve this , it will actually be necessary to achieve greater coordination between the different policy areas and also to establish clear priorities .
first of all let me thank the president-in-office for his response .
unfortunately that is the situation .
priority should be given to this in any future negotiations .
it is a very serious matter .
i would like to thank the president-in-office for his response .
the increasing use of drugs is one area where there is common concern across all member states .
this is a very difficult issue .
thank you very much .
that is a good example from colleagues .
i can go along with the rapporteur on all these issues .
i would make one point , however .
this is what concerns me .
so some of our competition money could well be used for development rather than aid .
i should now like to reply to one or two specific comments .
i come up against this problem more and more .
more and more i am asked ' if the others are doing that , why should not we ?
' i feel i have to point that problem out .
it goes back to the time of ireland 's accession .
and there are established rights .
and that is what was agreed .
another question is what the rate will be for companies .
the debate is closed .
that is too high a price to pay .
i would ask the commissioner when parliament can expect to see this proposal .
we already agree on the approach , so i think the proposal is actually already there .
it is a question asked many times before , commissioner , but one that is not going to go away .
we would even go a step further in some areas .
for these reasons , we cannot accept the proposed amendments .
the debate is closed .
what can parliament do ?
i should now like to hear him comment on the state of play .
obviously , there must be cooperation .
that is what is needed , not legal regulation .
however , they have also tabled some amendments relating to the interests of the general public which we can support .
at the same time , i think our european debate has to go further than that .
markets will want to know what the rules of play are .
in my view , we have also taken forward the debate on the information society .
in fact , europe has also made progress in this field .
two issues that were agreed and discussed recently give some cause for concern .
i am one of those who hope he will keep up the good work .
we all share in that hope .
the debate is closed .
that is something i believe we can all support .
the debate is closed .
that is social policy at its best .
things cannot go on like this .
as to your questions , madam , i really cannot answer them , unfortunately , and i will tell you why .
that may well be so .
there can be no question of my coming out with a commission position as such today .
however , this has not been done .
only then can we speak of ' communication ' .
the commission has not yet decided what measures it will take .
and how could it be ?
the commission has yet to make a proposal .
once it has done so , we can see what parliament has to say .
you can do it tomorrow if you like ; the opportunity is there if you so decide .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
we take note of that .
the minutes were approved
the next item is the joint debate on :
i would now like to refer to a few practical points .
i just wanted to say a few words about that .
i would now like to address a number of different points , taking one subject at a time .
the first is asylum and immigration .
relations with third countries are particularly important in the field of justice and home affairs .
my next subject is eu enlargement .
i welcome the fact that we are not just discussing these issues today alone .
we will continue that practice .
i shall now turn to my second point .
i say that simply because we know very well that this is of special interest to europe 's citizens .
as you know , this convention is of great interest to europe 's citizens .
but let me return to the convention itself .
this too was a very positive development .
i have no doubt that this too is a very important step forward that should be brought to the public 's attention in an appropriate way .
i am sure i do not need to tell you that this decision will be a rather important one .
i think it is right to draw attention to this .
applause
another important priority last year was enlargement .
this is something we should welcome and encourage .
cooperation in justice and home affairs obviously has a place on today 's eu agenda .
ten of these proposals were based on commission initiatives .
the member states presented 11 proposals .
mr president , on a point of order .
you mentioned that we are under great time pressure .
i think that can be done through the committee or by other means .
it does not always happen , unfortunately , but nevertheless a good many proposals are put to us .
i think that internal security is an extremely important issue for the public , and that people want to have both freedom and security at the same time .
i have no more time to deal with any other points .
we find that unacceptable .
that would already be a significant step .
however , information does not mean control .
you have expressed your agreement , mr president-in-office .
thank you , madam president-in-office .
that is what we have to vote on .
i put the request from the green group to the vote .
this is an important moment in the life of our institutions .
i would first like to say a few words about the resolution .
applause
mr president , i want to express my welcome and thanks to all those who voted with our resolution this morning .
applause
applause
there is a second point i would like to make .
from now on , you are going to have to work with parliament .
applause
applause
this must change !
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
mr president , the resolution that has just been adopted is a good text .
our group has already done so in the past .
applause
applause
i welcome this .
they are in fact a result of the nature of the institutional system itself .
we want to put an end to this system and give the control of the european institutions back to the nations .
there is still a long way to go .
that is unacceptable .
applause
we need to reform these institutions if europe is to make real political progress .
there are obviously a lot of things that need to be put right .
i congratulate it .
what have we done ?
what have we done ?
we have done three things .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , where do we stand now ?
the motion on which we are now voting is not a motion of confidence as the rules do not allow this .
finally , europe is at an extremely important stage .
if we want the commission to improve its management , we need to give it the time to do so .
the best thing it can do for the european union is to go .
nevertheless , this is the beginning not the end of the process .
this was done by the european commission .
this health risk was taken by the commission .
and that is what has happened .
in fact , we have no confidence in the president of the commission .
things should not have been allowed to get this far .
i have three points to make .
this is not acceptable .
there are many things which point towards that .
so what further progress can we expect ?
applause
thank you , mr president-in-office .
the joint debate is closed .
we should perhaps bring out that point more clearly in the resolution , or at least in the discussion on the resolution .
i have to say to them : if you believe that , why is it not in your joint resolution ?
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
it is time to say that we have had enough .
that is the current situation .
we must try , however .
finally , mr president , a point of order .
the joint debate is closed .
the european parliament has always supported the un resolutions , and now is a good opportunity to focus attention on them again and put this issue back on the international agenda .
i believe that the commission has done so too .
we in the european parliament can do even more .
it is now high time it did .
the union must , of course , encourage the peace process and make its own contribution to it .
i would like to ask the commissioner a question about the peace process .
there is hope in europe and i believe that we here can also provide a response .
mr president , there can be no peace without human rights .
this is a task for the european union too .
yet this has just not happened .
not at all .
there is no doubt that the international community has a responsibility in this matter .
efforts are currently being made in this respect .
so we should provide this funding .
if you agree - and i am sure you will - then we will be able to begin to provide more funds .
in addition to this , we must look at what we can do to help the peace process .
mr president , there was one point which the commissioner made that i did not entirely understand .
we will only see the benefit of this in days to come .
the commissioner , i am sure , will allow me to tell him that he is right .
but the council will be aware of our discussion .
parliament is free at any time to ask the council to be present .
but it is the council that must take the final decision .
the joint debate is closed .
this peace process should benefit the people and their country .
human rights can only benefit from such efforts .
they are part of this process .
we are not used to that here .
that was the point i raised .
it seems to me that there are two especially important points .
this takes us back to the institutional conflict between the commission and the council .
but that is a political issue .
the joint debate is closed .
with respect to our resolution let me be clear .
this is not an appropriate use of european assistance .
this is not an appropriate use of national assistance .
we should all be clear about this .
we should , and we must , congratulate them .
if we want to prevent this , then it is high time we did something about it .
madam president , most of what has to be said about this issue has been said .
the joint debate is closed .
i am voting in favour of this report today .
so it is more than just a legal problem .
this is why we think that , before any changes are made , we need to know the effects of the regulations that are in force .
however , it is clear that this is needed within the union .
cooperation in the fight against crime is necessary .
i shall return to that in a moment .
that was not the position of the committee on employment and social affairs .
what could be more important to us than our children ?
that is precisely what makes this report necessary .
both need protection and support .
madam president , much of what has been said here makes good sense .
however , it must be done in a proper way and in the proper place .
we may achieve the same objectives by going about it in a different way .
that may be the way we have to approach it .
unfortunately , it would not be the first time .
the debate is closed .
european direct investment can and must be a force for good in the developing world .
the law is the law !
that is why it is right and important that this initiative should be taken .
madam president , i should first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
is there not work to be done in this field ?
i think this would be a good idea .
madam president , commissioner , i would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the production of this report .
the governments of developing countries must be made take responsibility for the implementation of standards that respect fundamental labour principles and rights .
a certain amount of progress has certainly been made in that area in recent years within the european union and in its trade instruments and development .
what do i mean by this ?
the debate is closed .
it is extremely short .
parliament adopted the resolution
this is the direct responsibility of the member states and the commission .
it is up to nations themselves to develop this .
regional cooperation should help in this .
we must act together to ensure this .
various proposals are put forward in this document , some of them good , some of them not so good .
the union 's policy on this in all areas of the world must be based on clear criteria .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the resolution
yet i ask myself : where are the actions ?
i ask the commission : where are the implementation proposals ?
i ask the council : where are the necessary funds , the majority of which must be provided by the member states ?
two things need to be done .
employment opportunities are also considerable .
this has been said many times .
many thanks .
applause

the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the resolution
impact of financial crisis on european industry
the question that has been raised today in the house can only be the beginning of a very fundamental debate on this problem .
in this situation the left has a real opportunity .
how do we achieve a global monetary policy ?
in this context , free access to markets has a crucial role to play .
this is the union 's main concern at the moment .
the debate is closed .
joint motion for a resolution on the economic and social impact of the global financial crisis on european industry
before the vote on amendment no 2
parliament adopted the resolution
this is the case with france .
common fisheries policy action plan
we must promote stability in the sector , particularly with regard to access to resources .
these are some of the areas which are mentioned in the report .
it is a very good report .
i welcome this report .
finally , i should like to make a point in relation to my own country .
it is thus important to stress the need for monitoring to be effective throughout the community and not just in certain member states .
in our opinion , these proposals are therefore excellent and we will vote in favour of this report .
the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament agreed to the request
thank you very much , madam president .
we cannot avoid the need to continue to reduce overall fishing effort in the short term .
however , this should only be the first step to deal with it , both at european and international level .
the debate is closed .
that will be done .
it is not on the agenda today .
the next item is the statement by the commission on agriculture and the environment - towards sustainable agriculture .
i would stress the fact that it will be up to the member states , and not the commission alone , to ensure that this takes place .
to a greater extent , agricultural policy will become a matter for our citizens and farmers .
this will of course make considerable demands on both citizens and farmers .
above all , it will be made clear that a reform without environmental progress is not sustainable , either for the environment or in political terms , for that matter .
after all our proposal is that we must have a rural development policy of this kind for every rural region .
how do you propose to help the rural areas with this kind of structural programme ?
that is not the right approach for the union .
you agree with this , i know for a fact .
that is my first question .
i would also like you to tell me what you mean in real terms by agricultural practice .
perhaps , therefore , we should consider these issues in relation to their environment ?
mr president , i have two questions .
when is that going to improve ?
that is what we are doing .
i would like to know how the commission views the situation .
i should like to thank the commission for its comments .
it is not that we are not aware of the problem .
of course , there has been progress .
that is why it is essential that we take action now .
secondly , we now need to follow the commission action plan and apply the principles of a single market as far as possible .
there has to be greater coordination here as indeed there has to be on research .
this , after all , is a global industry .
european companies are not really european companies any more .
that is still on the agenda !
this is also true in defence matters .
mr president , the commission is right to have given priority to developing a european policy on the defence industry .
i hope today 's commission proposals may change this .
the issues here are not just the industry , but the legislation too .
that is the right road .
so all things considered , i think this is an important report .
why ?
what i regard as important is not so much economic competition but a policy that is independent of the united states .
we have to demand that it is !
in the end it is not a question of markets .
applause
that is my first point .
that will not get us any further .
we have proposed an action plan that quite clearly states what we can do .
but that is the very last thing we should do . that would not get us any further at all .
i too think that such actions are wrong .
the debate is closed .
environment , security and foreign affairs
civil environmental legislation should be applied to all military activities .
, security and defence policy .
the debate is closed .
the commission has adopted five guidelines that you already know about and that have been approved by the committee on foreign affairs , security and defence policy .
its stability could be vital for the whole world , including europe and the united states .
the political and economic reforms go together .
they have no basis in reality .
so what is the statement doing ?
i have no time , so i will try to mention only a few points .
no such thing !
why ?
why do you want such relations with them ?
why can you not see that ?
here we must consider three important issues , the political , the economic and the human rights issue .
that is the view of a large majority of this parliament .
our communication set out a number of fundamental objectives .
it is clearly in our interest to bring it more fully into the global economy .
the debate is closed .
regional policy and competition policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
so i do ask everyone to think about this as a real issue .
the first concerns the democratic control of competition policy .
this is discussed in paragraph 10 .
then there is the question of state aid .
i have one more proposal concerning state aid .
my group will not be voting for those particular amendments .
i believe it is important that we have had this debate .
i do not expect the commissioner responsible for competition policy to comment at the moment .
the commission and the european parliament have done good work together in the past months .
so i have nothing more to add , in point of fact .
i just have one question for the commission , a very specific question .
i know that we will want to follow up this issue .
that is done through the european union 's structural funds .
that is national state aid .
in many cases , of course , the two will naturally go together .
why do we need to do that ?
that is certainly not in the common interest of effective , free and fair competition .
i believe it would be important to have national reports on competition , like the wto national trade reports .
but the situation is different in some other countries .
it is a fundamental issue as the commission has a direct and specific responsibility in this field .
this is all i ask .
we need to agree on the objectives of this process .
you have called on us to do something about this .
firstly , there is the general question of state aid .
there is no other solution .
we must be sure of what we want .
no one has asked this question .
this much is clear .
for the moment , i cannot say any more than that .
at this point , i cannot tell you any more .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
so let me come back to our internal programme of work .
i think it is essential , commissioner , to do a number of things at international level .
i have one last question to the commissioner .
i am sure we all agree with her , particularly as she has put forward specific measures to ensure that what has been agreed is carried through .
it is for us to pay .
so , it is a good resolution .
i do not think so .
the european union must continue to support this position .
that was a welcome development .
much consideration must also be given to dialogue with the developing world .
that makes us stop and think .
that too makes us stop and think .
it is clear that this cannot go on .
mr president , commissioner , you referred to the role of the united states .
i believe the issue today is a different one .
it is about the need for the european union to take the lead here .
you referred to the key role that the energy tax is to play .
mr president , i should like to thank parliament for the debate .
it is what we are trying to do all the time .
there will be some initiatives on the internal market .
later in the year , i think , we shall have an opportunity to discuss the problems relating to the wto .
the debate is closed .
this will not now happen .
this will no longer be possible in future .
for all that , we are naturally in favour of the agreement we have now reached .
if that can be achieved , then i believe we shall have established a good community system .
it is a very important principle .
it might have come more quickly .
it is for the consumer and for the consumer 's health .
it will not be the last .
why ?
that is the view of the commission too .
that is unacceptable .
that was all i said .
the debate is closed .
i believe the european commission should express itself quite clearly on this .
this issue has been around for many years in this house .
yet all this is not enough for the united states .
who are we to talk about the financial interests of the european community ?
this is where we have not been able to accept your proposed amendments .
this country , as you know , has been without a government as such for a long time .
and so we did .
the debate is closed .
i would like to go further than that .
however , there are several points to be considered .
the new report will show us how things have developed from there .
that is why we do not wish to come down on the side of any particular process .
but that is now in the past .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this point is important .
that is the reason why we favour competition .
we have tabled an amendment to this effect and hope the house will support us .
i shall focus on two points here .
but at what cost ?
in principle , that is a good thing .
that is what is behind amendment no 1 .
that is why we propose to adopt instruments for this specific purpose as soon as possible .
the debate is closed .
jobs of the future
it is not only wrong to demand too much of people ; it is also wrong to expect too little of them .
i believe there are three priorities with regard to sustainable jobs in the european union .
i think that is a most important point to make , and his report makes it .
absolutely nothing new is being done in real terms .
let us focus on education , let us work together for the common good .
additional demand for work can be created .
it is time to act !
it can , however , do two things .
all we have to do is take them .
what are jobs with a future ?
that is not even a difficult task .
commission .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
and about time too !
we shall look with great interest at the commission 's reports on this matter .
there is one thing we do not like .
we have to have fair conditions of competition .
mr president , i should firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
but i do not believe that we are in the right position to do so at present .
naturally , i welcome the commission 's initiative to improve things and draw up a new directive , but that is not enough .
this will come , the only question is when .
how can we talk about quality after that ?
i agree with the rapporteur that this proposal is a step in the right direction , but no more than that .
let me comment now on the amendments which have been tabled .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i would make two comments in response to what you have said .
i should like to thank the whole house for that !
before the vote on the draft legislative resolution
before the vote on the draft legislative resolution
second proposal for a regulation
before the vote on the draft legislative resolution
i am prepared to accept the amendments relating to this .
so we can vote on the legislative resolution .
second proposal for a regulation
before the vote on the draft legislative resolution
this is the second reading of a very urgent and very important legislative proposal , so i think the right thing to do is to vote on it now .
i will accept it now , but for the last time .
parliament adopted the resolution
if he will do so we can deal with this report in two minutes .
we must not have the funds going first to brussels and then coming back from brussels .
i agree with the main objectives in agenda 2000 .
more support should be provided for environmental and rural development .
our group will vote against the commission 's proposal if the amendments that it has tabled are not adopted and accepted by the commission .
in that sector , the commission 's proposals are unacceptable as they stand .
we have decided that , in the main , we will support the commission 's proposals in the vote on the agricultural part of agenda 2000 .
that must be the aim of reforms to the eu 's agricultural policy .
the commission 's proposal and the report are therefore welcome .
i am voting in favour of this resolution today .
for these reasons , i have voted against the report .
statement by the president
are there any comments ?
mr president , on a point of order .
the minutes were approved
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
we are all aware of her reasons for doing so .
applause
that has not been included here yet , so to that extent this legislation needs to be developed further .
that is why there has been a call at global level for each region to make its own contribution .
various amendments proposed by parliament have already been accepted , but now there are more .
i very much support the amendments tabled by the committee on the environment .
and these are scientific results .
there are good reasons for that .
as far as the amendments are concerned , let me say that the commission can support all those which have been tabled .
one was about further proposals . certainly there will be some .
the debate is closed .
we will vote against the three amendments that have been tabled .
the proposal we have before us is just a part of this approach .
the commission therefore supported the common position in its communication to the european parliament .
i will now comment on the three new amendments .
however , the commission cannot accept amendments nos 2 and 3 .
let me end there , mr president .
thank you for your time and your attention .
the debate is closed .
the amendments look extremely technical and they are so .
we therefore welcome them to the house .
there is only one that is not acceptable to the commission .
the commission can therefore support these three amendments .
the debate is closed .
the first would ensure that parliament is involved in monitoring , over the next 20 years , what progress the directive is actually making .
i would like , president , to make a few comments .
i would say , however , that i do not fully agree with her .
finally , i would like to make one further point , mr president .
that is one of the major problems .
that is unacceptable .
it is not acceptable that public health be put at risk like this .
i support this view .
but small countries like ireland simply do not have 20 years !
i congratulate the rapporteur .
what does this mean ?
further measures simply need to be taken .
the commission cannot accept these amendments .
i agree with the aim of this amendment .
can you give an answer to that , commissioner ?
it was not clear to me .
we can accept amendment no 11 .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
we shall ensure that everything is available in good time .
madam president , i just wish to point out that i was here yesterday .
the minutes were approved
that is wrong .
this is the kind of legislative proposal that has to stop .
progress is in fact being made .
if they are approved by the house , we will vote against the report .
there is no other way of dealing with the situation .
when do you think the council will take a decision on this ?
i therefore regard this report as a first step in the right direction .
we have heard - and indeed we know - that the focus is on the environment , but also on jobs .
that is the real problem .
i very much hope it is .
there is one point i should like to make in conclusion , mr president .
the debate is closed .
naturally , certain issues are open for debate , particularly the problem of third countries .
each of these 10 was approved by our group .
we want to encourage this and will therefore be voting for the commission 's proposal .
our group can support the principle of the draft directive .
we can do something about this .
i have three points .
as far as i can see , the answer to this is a clear ' no ' .
the problem is more a global than an eu one .
but is not the real issue something different ?
i think it is .
it is , i hope , with this in mind that the council will accept it .
how will they develop ?
when can we expect to see some results ?
i do not really believe this .
i have not seen any , despite reading them all .
what is wrong therefore with tax competition ?
there is one respect however in which i very much support the excellent work done by the rapporteur .
this is why i want this discussion to be included in the debate on the european union 's own resources .
it is quite simply vital for the union 's cohesion .
mr president , i too should like to welcome this proposal to work towards greater coordination .
the debate is closed .
we therefore ask you to vote in favour of them .
mr president , we should like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done on this rather technical proposal .
the debate is closed .
as a result , it would make more sense to vote on it tomorrow .
if we have time , i hope we will be able to vote on it today .
parliament approved the commission proposal
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , on a point of order .
parliament adopted the resolution
in the motion for a resolution , we have :
for that we need :
it is essential that all our citizens should be able to use it .
in the vote , therefore , we have decided to follow the line adopted in committee by our political group .
we should like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report .
but the fight must also take place at the level of the european institutions .
on the other hand , there is also the possibility of beginning discussions on a new organisation of work .
a joint contribution at european level must be considered .
the commission has already established a number of actions to help them .
we must accept that .
mr president , we are now in a very difficult position on this report .
the whole report has been referred back .
this is a green policy with an employment objective .
it is this area of development which we believe is particularly significant .
the debate is closed .
i should just like to mention two points which i think are very important .
that is certainly not true .
this too is a question of democratic access to information .
i can support most of the amendments proposed by the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights .
so what is involved ?
i am well aware that this was also the aim of parliament 's work .
overall , the commission is thus able to take parliament 's line on many points .
mr president , i am fully aware that i did not answer .
both proposals are independent and each has its own crucial importance .
the debate is closed .
some members have also tabled amendments , and i will vote in favour of those which follow the line taken in my report , as adopted in committee .
that is where the real progress has been made .
i believe that overall we can vote in favour of this draft report .
applause
in the long term , quality is the only way this can be achieved .
but that is not what we want !
i will look firstly at the positive changes .
but that is not the important point .
you never look into developing demand .
question time ( commission )
will we have more action , not just more of the same ?
to the extent that it might concern the european commission , including as a competition authority , we certainly are prepared to look into it .
something must be done about it .
you have the floor , commissioner .
furthermore , we all want to hear what they have to say .
my question , however , is this : is the cost we are discussing state aid ?
this is what the treaty says .
it has legal force and will therefore be applied under precisely the same conditions .
mr president , commissioner , i quite agree with you .
that is the situation .
i think we are currently making progress .
do you not think that a public statement might be called for , commissioner ?
you have the floor , commissioner .
all these initiatives are currently being discussed , a fact which we welcome .
thank you , commissioner .
that is the debate currently on the agenda , but as i said , we are also having discussions with the council of europe .
thank you , commissioner .
commissioner , i would like to ask you two things .
what is your position on this ?
a decision would have to be taken at that point .
but there must of course be a basic agreement in principle between the parties themselves .
perhaps the commissioner will reply to his question as well .
when we approach the council on these matters the council always says this is a matter for the commission , the commission 's responsibility .
we come here to ask a question of the commission and the commission says ' we were not aware of this ' .
that is not the information which i have .
i would like to draw this to your attention .
but nothing significant has been done here .
that is the right way to go .
so , you may ask , why have a market organisation ?
i would particularly ask you to consider this point again .
can you comment on this ?
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
i think that this in itself is a step forward .
secondly , i believe that it is time for the european parliament to set an example .
thank you very much for your kind attention .
this is something we welcome and look on as a step in the right direction .
moreover , there are also cases of this in the member states of the community .
such a situation is unacceptable .
this would allow us to progress more quickly in terms of the policies we are currently discussing .
i would also like to say something about the two amendments tabled by my group .
we share her concern and we will continue to support her .
madam president , i have decided .
here i have a lot of problems and difficulties .
however , our french minister is no better on this subject .
it is .
immigration policy is and must remain the responsibility of each member state .
i for my part will not do so .
we have been discussing this subject ever since i have been in parliament .
yet that is very often the case at present .
this is why a european approach is so important .
naturally the commission will do its best to ensure that progress is made .
as a beginning , i have put forward a proposal for a directive on asylum procedures within the union .
in my view , this is what will happen .
we need first to put this into context .
the debate is closed .
even though it was agreed in committee , i cannot really see the point of amendment no 1 .
furthermore , the proposal also takes account of the needs of new member states .
it is now up to parliament and the council of ministers to make a decision .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i think the actions i have proposed would be effective .
we have therefore naturally taken no measures in this respect .
in fact , it was so far down on the list that , naturally , it was not taken .
under what criteria do you meet people ?
therefore , i cannot answer your question .
applause
( the minutes were approved )
we have seen the results of this .
i note that the council is not present .
parliament must continue to support that .
in this connection i want to point to one other matter .
this would be a very important step in the right direction .
however , as has been said , there is a lack of will , content and means .
the work must therefore continue .
he does this very well in respect of the role of the european parliament and the new european policies .
we will therefore support his report .
it will benefit employment and social stability .
however , it is just being created and we must think about the future .
it goes without saying , mr president , that , under these conditions , we cannot support the report .
the euro will also have an impact on certain policies .
that is what i would like the commissioner to give an opinion on .
is the commission in favour of paragraph 10 ?
the debate is closed .
this is an important point .
mr president , i would like to speak on a point of order .
that is all i have to say .
that is why reform is essential .
after all , we have seen this in the past .
it was very difficult .
of course there will be problems on specific points .
and that is indeed welcome .
as a result , and because we believe that this is an important report , my group will vote in favour .
we could not agree more .
on this much we are all agreed .
but is this really the case ?
it must become a second legislative house , just like the european parliament .
this is why my group has tabled two amendments which we would ask the rapporteur to consider .
we are not talking about europe 's general position ; we are talking about the council of ministers .
the council does not even follow its own rules .
i hope that the commission will also stress this point .
where do we stand , where do we want to go ?
that way we will keep the public with us .
at present my group cannot support your report .
this is a fundamental point .
however , i must mention two points .
this seems to be in conflict with the previous paragraph .
this would also be an acceptable solution for small countries .
this idea is very welcome and i have taken note of it .
the treaty of amsterdam requires additional efforts in this area on the part of the union and its institutions .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i would therefore like to thank you all .
mr president , that is why we should vote for this report .
in that respect , the rapporteur is right .
it is essential for the union to make progress in this respect , particularly in view of future enlargement .
however , this has come about at a cost .
however , i hope that we see it only as the beginning .
the final development will take place in the coming years .
take the guidelines on employment , for example .
there is no other way .
however , at european level serious questions continue to be raised by many of our citizens concerning democracy and the european institutions .
i fully understand your concerns over certain issues raised by the treaty and , in particular , the question of how to establish the conditions required for its implementation .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
applause
we have now reached voting time .
applause
on paragraph 11
this is also the term that was adopted in committee .
parliament adopted the resolution
this is a very important and much needed initiative .
we will take the matter up again at second reading .
while we are working on such an agreement , i , like many others , believe that this proposal for a directive is certainly an important step in the right direction .
the commission has certainly done some excellent work here .
tax policy is , for the most part , a national matter .
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
the european parliament needs to find the right balance .
what about the economic and social cost of such measures ?
that is why we have not voted against the report .
we agree with the rapporteur and the majority of this house about the objectives involved .
if so , on what terms ?
however , the following comments are in order .
progress on agenda 2000
the next item is the statement by the council on progress on agenda 2000 .
i give the floor to the president-in-office of the council .
applause
we welcome his efforts in this respect .
we , however , need to make progress on our priorities .
parliament 's priorities on the general framework regulation are , in fact , clear .
how will they be discussed in the council ?
what would be the reason for this ?
we voted on structural policy and on agricultural policy .
i am a member of the committee on agriculture and rural development and i should also like to say something about agriculture .
we understand the farmers ' concerns .
the common agricultural policy is the european union 's main common policy .
how can that be acceptable ?
and what can you tell us about own resources , mr president-in-office ?
is it not time to face up to reality and accept that this reform as proposed will not work ?
nor do they want to understand it .
mr president , mr president-in-office , i would like to ask four specific questions .
perhaps i may be allowed to mention a few of them .
i also want to make two points in connection with the cohesion fund .
mr president , i have two questions for the council .
let me also say a few words on the structural funds .
is the council aware that we must set this as a priority ?
we agree with that .
it is not that you hope for our cooperation , but that you need it .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , i hope that you will reply to three questions .
what progress has been made on this in the council ?
we are talking about a lot of money for the individual states .
and that is what we will do .
one member of this parliament referred to public opinion in the member states .
let me just point out to you that public opinion in europe is not united on these questions .
agenda 2000 can make a major contribution towards that .
it is not a question of agricultural policy alone .
thank you , mr president-in-office .
the debate is closed .
mr president , on a point of order .
at present , it really does not work !
situation in kosovo
i give the floor to the president-in-office of the council .
we must promote and develop regional cooperation .
thank you , mr president-in-office .
thank you , commissioner .
this is the first thing that must be done .
i think that three very clear points must be taken into consideration .
i believe it is a good start that work is now being done towards a political solution .
i think that these are fundamental issues .
it is time all the parties to the conflict reached agreement .
as the european union we are taking the lead .
let us continue to do so .
i say again : this is not about kosovo 's past but its future , and the future of the people who live there .
it is not a question of being right but of being put in the right .
i welcome the statement by the president-in-office .
having said that , i support the work the presidency has done .
that is the point .
first : what can the european union actually do ?
that was the only way to create the necessary political , legal and military conditions for this initiative .
and in fact all this was achieved in less than ten days .
so i do not know why it did not , but we are now in the present time .
that is an entirely different matter .
the time has come for us to take this step .
the debate is closed .
at the same time , the interests of all european farmers must be taken into account in the context of the common organisations of various markets .
in order to achieve this , the rapporteur makes several proposals .
i believe we all agree on the need for regional integration .
and the people of other regions want the same .
do we not want to support regional developments ?
we would like to say that this is a good report .
the debate is closed .
in fact , it is a little more than a technical matter .
i therefore call on the house to support this report .
mr president , i should first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work on a subject which he has presented so clearly .
when can we expect something , commissioner ?
mr president , i just want to make two comments .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
mr president , i should like to thank the president-in-office for his response .
i would like to think that when a report comes from the commission the council will address that issue .
but let me point out again that this matter comes under competition law .
thank you for that reply .
some member states even think we should not make any changes at all .
it is too soon to do so today .
i cannot answer this question today because the relevant decisions have not yet been taken .
but the council is fully aware of the problem .
no i cannot and , above all , i will not do so , for major reasons of principle .
the presidency could not be prepared for this question .
you are well aware that during question time , you can only have the floor once .
thank you very much president-in-office of the council for a very full reply .
the main problem , however , is that the people do not have the funds to pay for it .
mr president , i should like to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
there are two additional points i would like to make .
nevertheless i can provide you with some information .
does the council share this view ?
i am sure you will understand that .
if you did , you are wrong .
they are two entirely different matters .
it cannot be the presidency 's job to discuss a member state 's problems if that member state itself does not wish it .
many thanks for your reply .
in legal terms , in terms of the treaty , i can certainly give a positive answer .
it is up to the commission to do this ; the council cannot do so .
the subject has been considered several times since then .
is that not possible ?
you are here in the european parliament .
i would like you to give me a direct answer .
i have nothing to add on the matter .
of course i will answer this question .
but to date this convention has not been discussed in the framework of the eu 's common foreign and security policy .
it seems to be fact .
for this reason the council cannot give its views on the report .
i do not know where we stand .
water policy
there is much that is good in this report , so i would like to thank the rapporteur .
that is in itself a success .
i am not quite sure this is the right european approach .
the council did not show any very serious commitment .
so we have done a little better than the council .
the presidency of the council has certainly achieved much in administrative terms .
but in my view parliament 's proposal was the better one .
the committee on the environment has put forward some excellent proposals , and i cannot understand why the council is prepared to accept so few of them .
i have no idea why the council is against them .
that is why we are in favour of the proposal and why we were even more in favour of the previous proposal .
the proposal makes that clear .
we fully support the idea of a framework directive for the community 's water policy and we very much welcome the proposal for a directive .
but it will be more than just that .
in conclusion , i can only welcome this report , and the same applies to the progress which has already been made .
the debate is closed .
there are many key points in the report .
this is all very good .
this is a problem because the basis we have for making such decisions is too small .
that is why we have tabled an amendment .
for that reason alone we should not take that decision .
the commission 's proposal does not take this into consideration .
i believe it is indeed necessary to take that approach in a field in which we do not yet have the necessary experience .
i do not have the time to go into every individual point so i will only comment on a few that i regard as most important .
it is obviously very important that we put in place legislation that the people of europe will have confidence in .
even then we would still be far from having a directive .
that means it would still take years .
thank you .
the debate is closed .
i believe this directive has set a good course .
i believe that is the wrong approach .
that would certainly have been in my amendment .
i do not think this is acceptable !
we need a serious and proper approach to it .
the question is : how do we achieve that ?
how the member states apply that is of course their business .
it is the principle that concerns me .
and there is a second reason .
after all , the question of application is the key question .
i should like to mention one or two points .
we therefore fully support amendment no 1 tabled by the rapporteur .
in fact , they do not think that at all .
i would like to comment on the many amendments in groups .
let me begin with the scope of the proposal .
here i shall comment on two aspects in particular .
the debate is closed .
that is indeed its right .
we must support the commission in its demand for respect for the wto rules .
for myself , i would say that i do not regard this as a good organisation of the market .
here we must stand up for our legislation .
the points we make in the resolution of the committee on external economic relations are very clear .
i should like to make a few comments , although i do not know if i shall receive any response to them .
if it is implemented , the action will certainly be taken .
what will we do if action is taken ?
it will be difficult for them .
the debate is closed .
but it is , of course , essential to take account of the general political context too , even in the case of a technical agreement .
i would ask the european parliament to support that wish .
applause
we look forward to the cooperation and hope that the report can be implemented as soon as possible .
therefore , when it comes to the vote on this report , our group will ask that it be referred back to committee so that it might indeed be approved under better circumstances .
these areas are not included in this research agreement , a fact which i am pleased about .
this is something that i simply cannot support .
however , in this case , the situation is entirely different .
the same situation , or even a far more difficult one , may result from the elections .
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on her work .
there are two aspects to this report .
i hope that this can be a force for progress .
what has this cooperation become today ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
so far so good .
why ?
there are two problems .
there are two problems that i would like to address .
but let us turn to the business in hand .
i believe that the commission has adopted an excellent approach in the directive .
at the same time , however , a system like this costs a great deal of money - above all when there are only a few countries that apply the system .
however , in the course of the further development of this legislation , i will be in a position to give a more specific response .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but why ?
so we agree on the aim .
that cannot be our line .
that is why the commission must think again on this in order to come up with a better proposal .
this is an extremely important matter .
i would like to know whether we are going to have a statement from the commission today or not .
we take note of what you say , and no doubt the commission will also have heard your comments .
applause
however , i was pleased to note that the commissioner took account of all the amendments tabled by parliament on trade organisations .
this is one of the reasons why we have voted against the report as a whole .
initiatives to this end should be supported by the european commission .
it has not come too soon .
in fact , what does this report actually deal with ?
there will be a common economic policy and a common tax policy .
it was not an end in itself , but simply one stage further along the road to european integration .
i therefore voted against this report .
but we can and we must make the first move here .
the report is therefore a welcome initiative .
we have voted against certain points :
finally , i should like , once again , to stress that enlargement cannot take place without there first being a change in the present institutional framework .
this is clearly an unacceptable situation .
there are several comments i should like to make in relation to this excellent report .
i therefore voted against the report .
i believe that the eu should be based on intergovernmental cooperation .
we cannot therefore support paragraph 11 .
european integration will only progress in the long term if the citizens of the member states see any interest in it either for themselves or their children .
i believe instead that :
mr president , the green group voted against this report because we feel it does not go far enough .
so it was essential that we put some amendment in .
but it is still unacceptable that the environment committee should actually water down a proposal by the commission .
safety must always come first .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
nevertheless , we should not stop trying to achieve peace in that region , because peace will never be achieved there by military means .
but it may be that a hard line will need to be taken by the eu .
i am sure the commissioner will agree with that .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
enough is enough .
that goes without saying .
that cannot be said often enough .
in fact , people have been saying , quite rightly , that it is all beginning to get out of hand .
a great deal remains to be done in defence of these principles .
the european union has raised this question a number of times with the us authorities .
the debate is closed .
europe must be prepared to do something to help here .
europe can and must help , and that is what our compromise resolution is about .
the situation was beginning to improve .
the joint debate is closed .
so the european commission can perhaps play an important role in this respect .
the debate is closed .
mr president , that is not the case .
mr president , i wish to make one or two points about the vote .
with good will i do not think it will take us very long .
let us move on .
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
mr president , if we had to refer the reports back every time there were elections in the countries concerned , we would no longer vote on any reports .
i therefore do not believe that we can refer this report back .
applause
mr president , i believe we should vote on this report now .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is no way to do things .
we therefore voted against this amendment .
it is not possible .
kosovo
what do we see on the european side ?
statement by the president
i welcome parliament 's support for this approach .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is the only right we have in this context .
as the rapporteur says , all things considered , the result is better than nothing .
procedures must be clear .
the rapporteur has done her best to ensure that parliament has a say and that majority decisions apply in the council .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
unfortunately , we can do nothing to ensure that they do .
it has our full support .
we have come a long way .
let me just mention one of these .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i would ask that only members who wish to speak on the minutes should ask for the floor now .
we take note of your comment .
but we shall look into how it was possible for this to happen .
applause
that is quite clear , and we do not need to discuss it any further .
the decision has been taken !
there is no point in discussing it any further now , since the legal situation is quite clear .
applause
applause
that is indeed the case .
that was for a number of good reasons .
it would not make sense for us to have a debate without the president of the commission .
that too means we should come forward earlier , and not later .
the house set up a group which reports to the house and we have a general political debate .
that seems to me the right way to do things .
i am in favour of this decision , and i shall vote for it .
that is unacceptable !
applause
applause
the minutes were approved
we cannot agree to this proposal .
events in kosovo are having a major economic and social impact on that country .
for these reasons , i voted in favour of the commission proposal .
the european union has a clear policy here .
there is certainly a great deal of scope for such assistance .
madam president , on a point of order .
however , that amendment does not mention the subject matter .
madam president , on a point of order .
also , you did not ask for the floor through your group , and you cannot force your way into making a speech now , even though you were not down to speak .
everyone might start to do that !
as far as the rapporteur 's amendments are concerned , he has our full support for all of them .
this is a good report , madam president .
the amendments tabled by the committee on budgetary control are good too .
we shall vote in favour of them .
i should like to say a few words on that .
madam president , on a point of order .
i shall return to that point .
madam president , this is indeed a very important report .
i am not at all sure any more whether i can support this proposal .
the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
i think something needs to change there .
as i said earlier , it is a matter of money .
is there actually the political will to do anything about this ?
these are my two questions to the commissioner .
i think it is important nevertheless to have legislation - a directive - for this area in order to provide a political framework .
i should like to see this too being taken into consideration in the future .
we follow the work of the three european standards organisations with close attention .
that is the system .
now to your individual points .
so in principle all that is being done .
so they do nothing about it .
but this report goes to the council as well as to parliament , and we shall be discussing it again with the council .
the debate is closed .
before the vote on paragraph 5
parliament adopted the resolution
these countries must be included , and they must be included in a report of this kind .
transport is the means of communication which makes trade possible .
these countries must also make efforts of their own to improve their position .
we do not need to change those .
the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the resolution
i welcome the commissioner 's statement .
it is vital that we take action .
if there is a need for additional research from the community side , of course we could do that as well .
the debate is closed .
applause
statement by the president
applause
let me also make a point of order .
thank you .
i am sure the commission will have taken note .
nevertheless , i am quite prepared to agree to your request .
applause
applause
a number of members have asked for the floor .
i do not think we should continue with this discussion .
are there any comments ?
applause
mr president , i asked to speak about the minutes .
the minutes were approved
agenda
at the request of a number of political groups , the following changes to the agenda are proposed :
so i would ask for this report to be referred back to committee .
parliament agreed to this proposal
secondly , before the start of the debate .
when the time comes for the start of the debate , you will be able to make your request .
i agree .
we will support it in that .
we support that position too .
applause
applause
this is simply not true .
people ask if we have a right to even ask that question .
of course we do .
so of course we have the right to state those demands .
i welcome the council 's statement in that context .
applause
applause
applause
what can our union do ?
i have a whole list of other things it must do .
perhaps , mr president-in-office , commissioner , we too can put something on the agenda .
i agree with him .
urgent action needs to be taken on that , and very soon .
we must be clear about a number of things .
that is another demand that is not set out in the statement !
the president-in-office did not give me an answer .
the commission has not expressed the wish to do so .
did the commission wish to say something on this ?
i do not want to make life difficult for you , madam president .
the debate is closed .
what has europe done ?
i do not doubt that you have done your best .
that is one point .
madam president , i want to make two points .
that does not apply to all the commission .
applause
thank you , mr president-in-office .
the debate is closed .
but good rules are not enough in themselves .
thank you for your attention .
i have just one or two more comments to make .
finally , it is very important for safety , particularly in road transport .
this particularly concerns transport by air and road .
that is what we should be discussing .
however , that is not to say that certain areas of social policy would not benefit from having common rules .
clearly , there is good reason to find a common solution at european level .
the community directive on working time - and therefore the current proposals - are based , as the house will know , on the protection of the health and safety of workers .
management of that kind obviously cannot - and , indeed , should not - be done by the commission or by the law .
that report will address all aspects of these questions .
the debate is closed .
we have said all that needs saying on that subject .
why ?
that is precisely why we must support the dialogue with young people in turkey , with the help also of this democracy programme .
what has turkey 's response been ?
however , this will not happen and so we must decide what to do .
we know very well that a start cannot be made before the year 2000 .
i am not aware of any .
i hope that the rapporteur and other members of the house will go along with us on that .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i do not want to discuss the fundamental importance of this education and training programme .
we have done so often enough over the past months and even years .
it is in their interest to do so .
there is another aspect we consider very important .
so we need more money .
for then we really could do something for the citizens of europe , and in view of the coming european elections , i believe we must fight for this together .
applause
the council has now reached a common position .
it is important that they do .
then they might understand europe a little better .
that is my first point .
it makes it real for them .
the key point is the funding .
but as we said , the problem is the money .
the debate is closed .
we welcome his committee 's proposal .
if my group has anything to do with it , parliament will make a start on that tomorrow .
however , the internal market makes that rather difficult .
i really cannot follow that at all .
mr president , may i ask the commission a question ?
the debate is closed .
i ask the house for its support by voting in favour of this report .
they have to believe they have a future .
although the regulation comes to an end , the policy does not .
but i go further .
that is why i like this report .
what is wrong with that ?
that is what we need .
we could talk instead about regional cooperation between several countries .
that is not always clear to them .
for all these reasons , we do not feel that the report before us today is appropriate .
the final point which i would draw to the house 's attention - and this is why i say that further consideration is required - is a problem concerning the treaty .
the debate is closed .
that may well be .
you will have to give up this position , and so will the commission .
the debate is closed .
what is the balance of european action in this respect ?
i believe that this must be one of the basic priorities for the new period of development .
that is a fact of life .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report .
this is therefore an opportunity for us to use the new community support framework to promote research and technology .
the debate is closed .
i have the following comments to make .
and what is actually the point of the commission 's proposal ?
then i have a few comments to make on the essential requirements .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on this report .
this is not the case at present .
children are naturally concerned about their environment .
the proposals put forward by the rapporteur will not encourage the consumer either .
we need all of these systems .
it is not .
the debate is closed .
i should like to stress that we are all united on that point .
that is the principle , and we all agree with it .
we all have to do that .
i have done it myself .
the people who vote for me make these products .
i cannot accept that and i hope parliament will not either .
that is the first point .
i very much hope that we can adopt this report tomorrow .
we would like to make the following comments .
why ?
we shall not make any progress .
that , in short , is what we all want to achieve .
we certainly have no problem with that .
but that should then apply to all products .
it is not so much a matter of new rules .
the debate is closed .
mr president , this is an extremely important issue for the business community and for citizens within the european union .
there are two final points i want to deal with .
transport is another .
i will focus on four points .
i think that is most important .
my final point concerns the nuclear sector .
we have no idea what will happen here .
finally , mr president , a question for you .
but we cannot be sure of that .
clearly this is an important issue .
i would like to ask the commission , then , who is responsible in the case of russia ?
there are some who do not even know anything about the problem at all .
the responsibility is a global one .
legal rules already exist to deal with problems such as this , because in legal terms it is nothing new .
this is why we do not think it would be a good idea to propose new legal rules .
we now know what the commission is doing , but can you tell honourable members what stage parliament has reached ?
the debate is closed .
the most important aspect of the community 's activities in the area of health and safety at work is legislation and its application .
considerable progress has been made in this field .
these are important priorities .
they will need every possible kind of support to achieve the levels that exist in the community .
our committee has already mentioned stress , in particular , as being one of these .
we should welcome this .
it is also a part of the internal market .
that , i think , is one of the essential things which need to be done .
that too is an extremely important aspect .
of course , we cannot accept that .
i think that this is extremely important .
the third point is the question of the committee itself .
and we will continue to stress this point !
this is a major issue , but unfortunately the report on this , for which i am responsible , will not now come before this house as there is not enough time .
what is this issue all about ?
parliament has already done a considerable amount of work on these , but there is still more to be done .
this report is a good and important initiative .
so we must demand a total ban .
the first priority is to make eu safety and health legislation more effective .
measures to improve health and safety at work can make a significant contribution to these activities .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i have been trying to get the floor yesterday and this morning , so thank you for giving me the opportunity to say something now .
thank you .
that is why we voted against this report .
for the reasons given above , we voted against the report in the final vote .
given these conditions , the report should have been referred back to committee .
it is a country where there are both political and social problems .
however , this agreement only makes sense if it is in the interests of all parties .
we therefore also voted against the resolution which the house has approved today .
this was a necessary step .
however , we would question whether the european union is the appropriate authority to take decisions on many of the issues involved .
i have voted in favour of this report , as it is one of the most important in the area of fisheries to be considered by this parliament .
mr president , i am voting in favour of this report today .
statement by the president
there is a great deal of work to be done .
efforts have been made , but there is no doubt that we need to continue in the same direction .
applause
applause
are there any comments ?
mr president , what you have just said is all very well , but we should respect our own rules of procedure , especially on a day like today .
we know how difficult this work is .
i have another question .
i cannot answer you because it is up to the groups and members to take the initiative .
they want to see some money .
at the time , you said you did not know .
i would like to make one further point . i happen to know that france has done everything necessary .
i can tell you nothing more .
secondly , what was such a view based on ?
the minutes were approved
order of business
the following amendments have been proposed .
there is no need to take a vote .
mrs green has the floor .
why ?
that is no kind of a solution .
that is the first thing .
parliament approved the request
i have to be against , then .
we have a major problem of principle here in this house .
i do not think that is quite what the agreement is .
he is also a member of the committee on agriculture and rural development .
they refer to the agricultural policy of his own country .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
what then is the situation in our countries ?
women 's organisations play an essential role in the fight against violence .
the demand for support is far greater than the resources available .
for many years the issue of violence against women was discussed as a women 's problem .
therefore we should not only focus on women .
women and children are the victims of this violence .
applause
to fight against violence towards women is the responsibility of us all .
applause
mr president , i am speaking here on behalf of the committee on women 's rights .
applause
the european union has many resources it can draw on to provide assistance .
i know i speak for the majority of my colleagues here as well .
mr president , there has been some talk about the legal basis .
the european institutions did not want to hear a word about it .
that is the reason there is violence against women .
why not say so then ?
it certainly must not be discussed .
this is a very significant day .
we expect to see action across every member state .
applause
the europe which we create must be one of culture !
that is precisely what we would not want .
that is why we proposed it to both institutions .
thank you , commissioner .
women 's health
mr president , commissioner , i would like to congratulate the committee on women 's rights on the report it has tabled and to say that , in general , i support it .
we wish for even more than that : a specific programme !
more to the point , we need a policy for women 's health .
this report is much better , and at least makes clear what parliament 's priorities are with regard to women 's health .
the debate is closed .
the measures taken up to now have not had an effect in all areas or on the direction in which community policy is going .
naturally , something has to be done .
of course , the same also applies to parliament .
i have three points to make .
we want more women involved in decision making .
i include my own government in this .
but much still needs to be done on jobs and equal pay , for example .
and that is one of these positive actions .
it does not , however , mean that no problems exist .
that is the only way we are going to get any change .
you only have to look at the european institutions themselves .
that is the reality .
that is because they have to be so much better to actually get there , and we really have to address this point .
what we also have to do is make it possible for them to get to that position .
that has not happened throughout the european union , and we have to do something about it .
thank you , madam president , and thank you , commissioner .
i should like to mention a further point which i am concerned about .
the debate is closed .
why not ?
why ?
mr president , i welcome this general debate on equal opportunities on international women 's day .
so our view is that this commission proposal does not provide the answer .
elections are due there very soon .
even in training programmes this is not taken into account .
that is also what all of you have been talking about .
we are doing so with a very open mind .
there are legal questions on several aspects of the article , particularly as regards its scope .
the debate is closed .
decision on urgent procedure
would you be in agreement with that proposal ?
amendment of the rules of procedure
the first was on the implementation of the treaty of amsterdam .
that is not the case .
the rule changes do this .
i shall not go into all of them .
all the amendments are important , madam president .
the will is certainly there .
the opinion must be expressed when the vote on the full text is taken in committee .
but that is not really my problem .
let me make one final point , madam president .
why do i say that ?
these rule changes should make everything much more open .
it tabled only two amendments .
that is the result !
i am particularly concerned about one point .
the commission is no longer to be a result of the decisions of the member states alone , but in effect a common government of the eu .
parliament cannot simply take power from the member states on its own authority .
for that reason , i am going to vote against this amendment .
such a change would only add to the difficulties .
i do not think we should set about making parliament less democratic in this way .
mr president , the european parliament is a young parliament .
the same is true of the proposals relating to the consideration of the legal basis .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , on behalf of the group of the european people 's party , i should like to express our full support for the proposal for a regulation put forward by the european commission .
a number of other members as well as myself have tabled amendments on this .
there is one other point i need to mention .
it is not the case that nothing has been done in past years .
the member states would have to do so .
we want to support research .
there are problems with economic criteria .
as i said , we are at first reading .
it did not work .
that is why we want to support research rather than make it more difficult .
that is why we do not want to accept that amendment .
then we come to the question of the fund , which has also been raised during the debate .
as i already said , this is the first reading .
that is why i did not want to go into all the amendments .
in our view that cannot be the purpose of the proposal .
the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the resolution
it is very important for us to know that .
applause
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
we shall see .
that needs to be made very clear .
so it has to be ' under certain conditions ' .
parliament adopted the resolution
members of the europe of nations group are therefore in favour of this decision , provided certain amendments are adopted .
we have voted against the report for the following reasons :
so i agree with the rapporteur .
however , we can fully support these measures , as long as they are carried out at national level .
specific measures are therefore needed .
we need :
yesterday was international women 's day .
agenda
parliament approved this proposal
it is very important that the quality of legislation is right .
mr president , parliament 's committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection has done some excellent work on this report .
' .
this issue has come up again and again and the commission has done nothing about it .
even member state governments have done nothing about it .
mr president , i should like to begin by saying that this is an important matter .
i want to stress two amendments which are important .
it is not enough to set standards now and then never come back to them .
so i hope the commission will take into account some of these amendments .
i do not think that can do us much good .
i would ask you to consider this at the vote .
nevertheless we wanted to take a first step with our proposal .
then there is amendment no 12 .
if necessary , the commission will act at once .
i did say ' if ' .
and the commission does apply that principle .
but obviously we cannot make that a general principle .
and you cannot expect that of the commission .
the debate is closed .
public health policy
mr president , the development of the european public health policy has now reached a very important stage .
so what should be done ?
it will take a great deal to bring their standards of public health up to our own .
this technology is available now .
i believe that the member states have a very major responsibility .
in my view only the member states can take on this responsibility .
i would far rather see the responsibility left with the member states .
applause
mr president , there can be no doubt that public health policy is , to a very large extent , a national matter .
in my view , this is the area where the commission has an important role to play .
it has become clear from the discussion where we must start with our work .
in my view , there is a great deal we can do .
so there is a great deal to do here .
in any case , there is no need to discuss that further .
for that is certainly one of the problems .
here we agree with his assessment of the situation .
the debate is closed .
this point of principle is very important .
that is its right .
applause
for that and many other reasons we support the motion for a resolution .
so i ask you , where do we go from here ?
we have always had this commitment of access to our markets .
why now ?
this is why there must be changes in europe .
it is vital to respect the wto rules . the rule of law , international law included , is in everyone 's interests .
applause
what is the aim ?
that is in the interests of europe , it is in the interests of the united states and it is in the interests of the world as well .
thank you , commissioner , we are behind you .
the debate is closed .
own resources
but we cannot achieve this important aim on the expenditure side .
applause
i am speaking on behalf of the committee on institutional affairs .
the committee on institutional affairs had two concerns on this issue .
work that one out if you can !
applause
and yet the hard work she has put into it has made some progress towards a position that all the political groups can support .
the last thing we wanted to do was to come before parliament with so many amendments to be voted on .
she has done very well .
mr president , i just wanted to propose a compromise .
perhaps we could come to a compromise .
parliament approved the request
these are very fundamental points for the future .
in that respect it is a report of fundamental importance which we should welcome .
obviously there are a number of points which cause difficulties .
he said so in so many words .
we have heard that point before .
that is a very positive point .
mr president , thank you for having agreed to put our proposals to the vote .
what policies and at what level ?
we believe that this is the only sure way to achieve this objective .
the european commission has made a number of proposals .
question time ( commission )
thank you very much .
thank you for the answer .
is a draft convention now available ?
thank you for your reply .
thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
you have to take more into account the whole question of , not just giving aid , but fair trade .
i do not think it is appropriate to use that word .
mr president , following the commissioner 's answer i would like to put a general question to the commission .
the second is to try to make the agreement as fair as possible and take account of the special requirements of the other party .
nevertheless , these events took place in an area where community law does apply .
i do not think it is a real question .
there is no question about it .
i thank the commissioner for that reply with words like ' responsibility ' and ' individual responsibility for certain areas ' .
so i think that is enough for today !
as you know , the eu 's current action plan on drugs comes to an end this year .
during the past year , a great deal has also been done to step up cooperation in precisely this area within the union .
of course the union is doing a great deal , as i made clear in my reply to the honourable member .
the first proposal was not accepted , and another proposal is now before the council of ministers .
i agree that the issue raised is serious .
that is why the may 1998 agreement was an important step forward .
it is not true , however , to say that it has no effect .
i thank the commissioner for a very full answer .
that has already happened .
but as far as this specific question is concerned we did not find a real problem .
i would like to thank you for your reply .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
these are the rules .
thank you for your reply , commissioner .
this has now been achieved .
this is the situation .
thank you , commissioner .
but in my opinion , the committee on budgets has not reached the right conclusions .
what are we really talking about here ?
i want to congratulate her on that .
so i think we make too much of that issue .
the other point is the question of the just return .
that is fair enough !
my opinion is that it does not .
the report has nothing to say on this .
in order to develop that , the report should really be referred back to committee .
it will not be the last report by the committee on budgets to cause us problems .
this has been given a lot of attention in the present discussion with the member countries .
i once again congratulate the rapporteur for her excellent work .
the debate is closed .
we are not , however , able to accept amendment no 1 .
the debate is closed .
i would never go so far as to say that .
there are two other points i would like to address .
and we continue to support you .
and that is the basis on which we should decide tomorrow .
we think that is wrong .
there is a need for development all over europe .
that is what i want to talk about today .
i think that is the crucial point .
that is our task and i believe the commissioner should do us that favour .
i share the views that have been expressed , but there is one aspect which i should like to develop a little further .
that would be very good .
i understand that view very well .
those proposed amendments cannot , therefore , be accepted entirely .
but perhaps we will be meeting again next year !
this , however , is not the proposal before the house .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
in that regard i have taken several aspects into account .
i believe the commission has done a very good job in many cases .
i think that is the essential point .
or is that really the case ?
it is a long way from decision to reality .
i believe we should be aware of the fact that changes and market developments do not happen by themselves .
decisions need to be taken .
the market will not change this situation by itself .
i do not agree with him at all .
why do we say that ?
i should like to go back over two points .
the second point i should like to make concerns competition .
in the interests of consumers and of our environment , it is vital that this should change .
why is this ?
there is no doubt that these are two very important reports .
the fact that the work is now in hand is a positive development .
this is the direction in which things are going today .
i am pleased to say that we can accept the majority of the committee 's proposed amendments .
there are two other amendments which we do not feel able to accept .
obviously we are far from the end of this process .
the debate is closed .
we will meet that commitment .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
the minutes were approved
mr president , i do not want to comment on the minutes .
agenda
however , i would like to say two things to you .
secondly , this is a different issue .
mrs green , you have the floor .
that was also what parliament wanted .
on behalf of my group , i should like to support what mrs green has said .
that is a different question .
obviously i accept that we will not be voting on the agreement on information today .
i have to know so that i can plan a further discussion of it .
i think that the same goes for the committee on institutional affairs ; it might also need to discuss it again , since it is of course the committee responsible .
it is , after all , the one which has tabled this report here , not the committee on budgetary control .
in any case , we want to discuss it again and i just need to know whether it will be on the agenda then .
applause
applause
mr president , in this context , i should like to make a comment which in my view is important .
first of all , i would like to look at the common agricultural policy and rural development .
i come now to the third item of agenda 2000 , the financial aspects .
applause
the first is the principle that there must be sufficient funding to develop community policies .
i do not know of any type of policy that can be implemented without funding .
however , it is absolutely clear that no policy - be it national , regional or local - can be implemented without sufficient funds .
my second point - and this is no less important - concerns the question of cohesion .
if you are to bring about an agreement which will benefit the european union , you will of course also need the support of our group .
i believe that this is of crucial importance .
in addition , we must of course also say that the debate on rural areas and agriculture is a very important one for our group .
this is certainly not something you did not already know .
let me draw your attention one last time to one of parliament 's resolutions .
we really want to move forward .
at the same time , real reform is necessary .
that is an essential point .
finally , on the question of own resources .
why ?
that would be the right approach for the future .
the agreement must be acceptable to all , not only a majority .
we must not allow this to happen .
so it is possible !
i would stress one point : budgetary resources .
i hope that we will be heard .
only then should the council propose its candidate for the presidency of the european commission as provided for in the treaty of amsterdam .
for this i hope you have a good hand !
quite clearly the council and commission have been able to make no progress in the whole area of the reform and everything that goes with it .
this reform will be like all the reforms in the past .
i hope he will do that .
we certainly do not .
we need to avoid this for future programmes .
this takes time .
without the social fund , the relevant measures would perhaps still not exist today .
how right he is !
we have problems , especially in agriculture .
i have said for quite a long time that need not be the case .
that cannot add up !
we agree that there must be a policy for farmers .
we agree that there must be a policy for economic and social cohesion .
we agree that there must be a policy for enlargement .
but there can be no policy without money and i want to be clear on this point .
i have two comments to make , firstly on agriculture and secondly on the structural funds .
i want to point out that , especially with regard to the structural fund regulations , the agreement of the european parliament is required .
however , this is not what agenda 2000 is about .
we will make no further comment on this , but will simply put in the necessary work on an overall compromise .
i fully agree with all those who have said that there are many reasons why we need a reform here .
now is the only time it actually can be discussed .
that also applies to germany ; we know that very well .
parliament 's support is important .
applause
the debate is closed .
welcome
applause
situation in kosovo
the international community is prepared to play its part .
this is therefore the commission 's position on this important issue .
mr president , i should like to make a few comments .
firstly , it is our opinion that there can be no military solution to the problem in kosovo .
mr president , i should like to thank the president-in-office of the council for his statement .
i believe there has been some considerable progress .
therefore the events of the next week or so are going to be crucial .
we must have an agreement .
but we have to have an agreement first .
it is absolutely essential .
applause
that has always been my group 's line in this conflict too .
what role will the european union play in that ?
in european terms , kosovo is not another iraq .
the debate is closed .
for all these reasons , i call on parliament not to go down this road and to refer these two reports back to committee .
we have to achieve this , and that is why i really do ask that we put this to the vote today .
that is why it is important for us to vote today .
applause
today parliament must vote on both of these reports .
we must now move forward and show the council and the commission what we can achieve .
applause
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
but now that is all over .
this is also an important area of cooperation between the member states and the european union .
what is its aim ?
we cannot accept this under the present circumstances .
today 's debate is therefore very welcome .
the commission has provided us with information on this .
firstly , there is no legal basis for that kind of measure .
so for the most part , we must make do with what we have .
in general terms , social policy should be a national responsibility .
however , health is often an aspect of both social and environmental issues .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i would like to draw your attention to four points , mr president-in-office , and i would ask you to comment on these .
nevertheless , i would like to take this opportunity to mention two points once again .
not only has it made an important financial contribution , but by doing so it has also allowed the political agreements to be implemented .
financial aid is political aid .
there are two positive points that i would like to mention .
and this is something that i want to stress .
i want you to understand this .
we therefore do not want the commission to deal with any more current expenditure .
no , we will not .
mr president , just this once i really want to talk about the rules of procedure .
we , at least in my group , are fully behind what you proposed here yesterday .
the conditions you mentioned , commissioner , will of course still apply .
mr president , i would like to make a point of order .
however , i will make a note of that aspect of your comments .
how ?
something has to be done here .
at some point this system must stop .
it is not enough .
that will be a step forward .
however , i should like to ask whether , with the way things are developing at the moment , these are the only issues .
do we want to take action at international level ?
mr president , we support the two reports being discussed .
it is now more essential than ever to have a true european common security policy .
obviously , if we are in agreement from one side of this house to the other , it means that this approach , and this one alone , is the right one .
mr president , i just wanted to say that this has been an excellent debate .
i see that a large majority of the house is in favour of a certain position and its main points are very clear .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
some of them have been up for discussion for quite some time .
there are two things to which i would like to draw attention .
this is a conflict .
this technology no longer has a future .
her amendments are a step in the right direction .
the debate is closed .
we cannot tell them what they must do .
and there are reasons for this .
some of them simply had to be closed down .
a number of things have been achieved under the nuclear safety programmes .
that is not new .
we have been working on this with these countries for quite some time now .
question time ( council )
as they deal with the same subject , questions nos 1 , 2 and 3 will be taken together .
does the european council share this view ?
i should like to thank the president-in-office for that answer .
so you can see how important it is in political terms .
mr president , i would like to thank the president-in-office for his reply to the questions so far .
there is no doubt that this is necessary .
what does he propose ?
as they deal with the same subject , questions nos 4 and 5 will be taken together .
we know the answer very well .
you must also be able to give that answer .
it is also better both for them and for us that they do not become one .
the fact is that it has been decided in this way .
i would like to thank the president-in-office for his reply which is in support of the position of the commission .
as far as i know , no decision has yet been taken .
can you tell me what the political strategy of the council is to find money for the social face of europe and for the protection of the environment ?
i could add many more to this list .
as they deal with the same subject , questions nos 10 , 11 and 12 will be taken together .
i give the floor to the president-in-office to answer questions nos 10 , 11 and 12 together .
then we could form an opinion .
unfortunately i have to say that there is no guarantee of this even in states where the rule of law is fully developed .
thank you , mr president .
he says that the council has no information .
is this of no concern to the council ?
however , it is good to hear that there has been some coordination on the basis of this initiative .
mr president , unfortunately i cannot do so .
the council must answer these questions , as these matters are its responsibility .
i would like to ask the president-in-office of the council to answer my question .
who will ?
it is not possible to answer it any more precisely .
i will say it once again .
in the council 's opinion , the rules are completely clear .
the honourable member says that she does not understand something .
she has not asked me a question .
it is clear .
you know very well that members can only speak once during question time .
i fully agree with your basic views on this .
it applies to your country , my country and many others .
all of this is included in our policy .
yet it has taken four years , and up to now nothing has happened , although an application has been made .
work needs to be done under the eu framework programme , in member states and in third countries , to develop the necessary technology .
this makes european energy policy a model for others to follow .
what projects , what problems ?
i would ask the house to vote for my amendment on this subject , which has already been approved in committee .
it is this response that is unacceptable .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we will discuss these later .
in conclusion , i should like to congratulate my two colleagues whose reports we are about to consider .
we know something needs to happen , and we have the means to achieve it , and yet nothing is being done !
the commission has our full support on this .
we all know that the council does not want anything to happen .
we should start with the european institutions themselves .
we always agree .
that is not the problem .
that really should have been included .
do something better than i proposed .
you will have my full support , but we must do something .
i see increased research and the development of new technology as the only way forward .
if that is so , we might just as well go home now .
the debate is closed .
it is high time that we had transparency .
we need an initiative from the commission .
i find this hard to believe .
why ?
that is the situation for the time being .
the fact is , that has not happened .
i could not have put it better myself .
obviously not .
we said no , because we want to create competition there too , for the benefit of the consumer .
the debate is closed .
there are four points in relation to which the committee on agriculture and rural development has made changes which we believe will be adopted .
the third point concerns the time needed for implementation .
these are the four points in relation to which our committee has made changes which i believe must be accepted by the commission .
we all understand that fact .
this is not the way to go .
i should like to thank the rapporteur for his own amendments and for those accepted by the committee on agriculture and rural development .
i would just like to say a word in conclusion .
the proposals before us move completely in the wrong direction .
nevertheless i think that decisions about our own health should be left to the individual .
why ?
therefore the commission cannot accept these amendments .
i should like to know which amendments you accept .
we want an answer .
the debate is closed .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this really is a very important report .
this is what i proposed in a second report to the legal affairs committee .
in my view , it is very important that we should have a decision on this tomorrow .
these amendments are therefore unacceptable to the commission .
the debate is closed .
that will be a task for you and i next year , commissioner .
but we have not reached that stage yet .
applause
in my view the single market on its own has been a protection .
the fact that most of our trade is internal has been a protection .
in particular we must :
this is clearly not enough .
that is really the central problem for us .
if that were true , then all this talk about the problem of high unemployment would not be necessary .
nothing new there , then .
this too is nothing new .
perhaps we will also have to consider structural reforms .
applause
but that alone is not enough .
so what does the commission say on this subject ?
despite everything , 1999 will be a year of economic growth in the european union .
only time will tell .
this has been the case for some ten years now .
but what ?
that is also a particularly important task for the european union .
we must set a good example here .
this is the first problem that the economic policy of the european union will have to address .
i shall therefore only make one comment on monetary policy .
it is a first step in the right direction .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
applause
applause
i would not think that to be the case .
applause
i should like a specific answer on this point .
it is not yet certain that we will be in that situation .
parliament agreed to consider the compromise amendment
( parliament adopted the decision )
mr president , i wish to speak against .
it should demand no less of itself .
either we keep to the rules of the house or we do not !
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i believe that to be against the rules of this house .
there are some proposals in the report which are not acceptable for other reasons .
amendment no 15 , according to which it will no longer be possible to form a group with members from only one country , is also not acceptable .
this was the only area of expenditure subject to amendment .
there must be changes here .
like the majority of the french members of our group , we voted against the report as adopted by the house .
there is a need to change and reform the eu 's system of own resources .
i believe that in principle only the council should continue to decide on the union 's own resources .
this is reason enough to vote against the report .
they are not the eu 's representatives in the member states .
i could not support this text .
this means that clear priorities must be set .
as regards the more specific proposals put forward by the commission , i have several comments to make .
france 's interests are different in all three cases .
it is therefore up to the member states to adopt any decisions which may be necessary on this matter .
the debate is closed .
the european union will continue to support the development of democracy in these young states .
it is up to us to do everything we can to put an end to this conflict , to establish peace in the region , of course , but also to promote economic development .
such economic development can only benefit from the resolution of the conflict .
the debate is closed .
russia
so europe must not change its policy here .
i do not .
from that point of view , this resolution does not go very far .
clearly , this must not be allowed to continue .
' .
it is extremely important that we should try to ensure that democratic elections are held as soon as possible , and we should certainly support them .
applause
un commission on human rights
we take that response very seriously too .
applause
what can be done to prevent that ?
that is the problem .
allow me to add a little to their comments .
this also means , commissioner , that financial support is required .
russia
that is also dialogue .
the joint debate is closed .
'
the joint debate is closed .
there is more to it than that .
we have received support from all the other groups .
my group has tabled several amendments on these two points .
the joint debate is closed
this is not the time , and we are not prepared for a debate without an opinion .
applause
it should take place in the political groups , since we need to find out if we can do anything more .
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
applause
applause
in its opinion , the committee on budgets takes the same line .
the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection is of the same opinion .
but we need the resources to implement the policy .
i will be voting in favour of this report today .
situation in kosovo
there are two main reasons for this .
we are voting against this report .
this is positive .
finally , in the vote i have supported all the amendments which we tabled in the green group and which are of great importance for the future .
we are therefore voting against this report .
however , we do share the report 's concerns about the global economic crisis .
this proposal was accepted without amendment .
that is the problem .
to my mind , the question we have to ask the commission once again is whether this agreement is really the answer , or should we not actually be doing far , far more for these countries ?
the debate is closed .
the committee agreed with me on this .
we shall vote in favour of it .
the debate is closed .
welcome
once again , welcome to parliament .
applause
mr president , i welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on his work .
this right does not currently exist in all member states .
the debate is closed .
social protection in europe
we welcome the commission 's report on social security .
i know that there are a number of others who wish to speak in this debate .
but what we lack is social protection at the european level .
applause
i fully agree with the rapporteur on that point .
for that reason , it is important as part of our social security to ensure that more jobs are created .
the internal market has of course increased the need for cooperation and coordination in the field of social security .
there should not be employment in some countries with little social protection and unemployment in countries with a high level of social protection . no , thank you .
the most important question at eu level in my view is employment .
it was important to do that , but there was not always the same concern to consider the consequences .
that is far too many !
in this area , there is any amount of work to be done .
there are good reasons why political action is so obviously required in this area .
the proposals made in parliament 's resolution go in the right direction .
social protection policy is a matter for which member states have responsibility .
we have common objectives .
the debate is closed .
with that , ladies and gentlemen , we have reached the end of our agenda .
are there any comments ?
i feel he has made a very good point .
parliament approved the minutes
we therefore voted against the report .
she has therefore asked me to present the report .
the commission can also show that considerable progress has been made in these areas .
it is therefore also difficult to see the effect of the proposed measures .
so what is the problem ?
the problem is a serious social one .
the commission can agree to two of the amendments proposed .
let us now move on to the amendments which the commission cannot accept .
the commission cannot agree to such amendments .
the debate is closed .
the population issue must therefore be a social and economic priority .
applause
here we come back to regional cooperation , which i believe can play a major role .
progress has also been made in recent times .
there are of course also a number of provisions to protect human rights .
it is of course important too that this should be done as soon as possible .
we still have a long way to go .
the report that we have before us today is a very good example of what precisely has happened .
we know there are problems .
i would like to make two further points .
respect for human rights is an essential basis for all european union agreements .
applause
this is , again , made very clear in the text of the resolution before us .
applause
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we have before us an important agreement .
this item is now closed .
you may have the floor , but only if it is on a different matter .
mr president , i should just like to make one comment .
parliament adopted the resolution
this is an absolutely fundamental political problem .
only then will we have peace .
this is a good proposal .
that is all i can tell you about this matter for the moment .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
parliament has now come to the end of its agenda .
this means that , as we are coming to the end of this parliamentary term , we have almost completely prepared the rules of procedure of this house for its next term .
many thanks to the french authorities !
mr president , i do not wish to thank the french authorities .
they really are working to rule .
ladies and gentlemen , i would propose that we do not begin a debate on this question .
are there any comments ?
the minutes were approved
order of business
does any group wish to take over this request ?
i can therefore say , on behalf of my group , that we are fully behind this idea .
mr president , i have heard that the commission and the council presidency will be here today and tomorrow .
there are other opportunities for that .
it is not possible at the moment .
the order of business was thus established
statement by the commission
applause
thank you .
applause
the european union needs a strong commission with authority to act , and needs it quickly .
where do we go from here ?
applause
applause
however , we may have to go even further than that .
applause
applause

this report and the one which will follow , is about something quite different .
now is time to look to the future .
colleagues , our responsibility now is to address three principles to the council .
the same cannot be said of the council .
the present commission is also having to take responsibility for the previous one .
where do we go from here ?
these reforms will take years , but we have to start on them right away .
we need a strong commission .
a great many people , even some in this house , keep saying that all this is good for their country .
if this has been a difficult week for the european commission , it has been a good week for european democracy .
where should we go to from here , is now the essential question .
how can we get out of this institutional crisis ?
nevertheless , we need to look to the future .
applause from the green group
applause from the green group
it has been progress for democracy .
at the same time , however , we need strong european institutions and in particular a strong commission .
all of the commission must go and not come back .
the new commission will have to meet very high standards .
you know how difficult that is .
we also agree that the reform process in the european union must include all the institutions .
indeed , i believe it is necessary for us to do that .
i should like to refer to another point that was discussed here .
madam president , this is certainly the first time that the european union has been in this situation , and i hope it will be the last .
had that happened , we should not be in this situation today .
they brought the problems to light .
we have a right to information .
what do we do now ?
we are not only at the end of a road , we are at a new beginning .
we need a new balance .
i should like to ask the president-in-office a question on this point .
i hope that is the case .
the president-in-office needs to reply to that point .
it will need to be a strong commission .
these must also be our priorities .
people have to be able to see that something is being done .
this must happen , and all it takes is political will .
this was not the case a few months ago .
the real question is : do we want to have the rule of the few or the rule of the many ?
this is why it is called a democracy . '
we have even heard some of them here today .
i do not think this is enough .
let us hope so !
he has my vote .
i hope that changes will be made to the structural funds .
perhaps the council will find it hard to work under pressure of time .
here too , mr president , the council of ministers must take responsibility .
and that culture is the culture of democracy .
can we live up to this culture ?
it is not a crisis of the european union .
i would call it more of a growth crisis .
so now the line which the new president and the new commission have to take is clear .
it is high time they did .
the national governments have shown no responsibility at all in this matter .
by ' us ' i mean all the institutions of the european union .
reform of the commission is the start .
it is the responsibility of governments to address that .
and finally , president , i would say that with regard to the role of the council of ministers , we know that they meet in private .
however , while i naturally agree with this in principle , i would also stress that we shall be in an entirely new situation .
the new commission is to be approved by parliament , which will also vote in the new commission president on the basis of the commission 's programme .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
so this is a most serious debate .
there was one problem .
but there is one more point i would like to make .
but i will say no more on that particular subject .
it has been a long , hard road .
all i ask is that we move quickly .
we are currently discussing how that policy may now be taken further forward .
the idea that was put forward for further development in the energy sector is certainly one that we want to consider .
so much for the military aspect .
we know each other only too well , of course , from the committee on external economic relations .
that is something we very often experience in the committee on external economic relations .
clearly we will be voting against this report , but that is not enough .
mr president , i understand the council is not present .
it seems to me that it should be up to the president to ask the council to give a reply .
can you reply to that point ?
it has to be seen in that context .
the joint debate is closed .
as we prepared the report , we put certain questions to the council which , in our view , were crucial .
we asked the council how many people were involved and about the extent of the immigration .
certain aspects of the action plan have given me particular cause for concern .
in this context , we are also rather concerned about turkey 's part in the action plan .
we have no idea .
my first question is this : what has actually come of all the measures taken under that action plan ?
we as parliament should have given our opinion on these matters .
so there is work to be done here .
the european commission has to provide that .
this is also relevant to relations with turkey . they continue to be difficult , of course .
let us hope that we can do so .
parliament should have been able to have its say before such an important document was approved .
at the same time , the implementation of the action plan is now the subject of a review .
the issue is now under discussion in the council of ministers .
for that reason , today 's debate is of great interest as regards the further implementation of the action plan .
we shall certainly make that request .
the debate is closed .
application of community law
it is not we who draft the legislation who have to understand it , but the people who actually apply it .
but what is at issue here is monitoring application .
we have had experience of this recently in the committee on legal affairs .
monitoring the application of community law is an essential part of what we are doing in europe .
the debate is closed .
why not under 15 % ?
the debate is closed .
so i will not say it .
but i did not support her on it .
there is another matter to which i would draw attention .
in fact i tabled an amendment on the subject at first reading , which was accepted .
that is essential .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this report is extremely important in economic terms .
i think that is quite wrong .
that cannot be in our interest !
but what we are doing is precisely to protect the farmers !
in the commission 's view , this is an important and very urgent matter .
the debate is closed .
the member states of the european union make a vital contribution to these .
i think that more work on these issues is called for .
and what does quickly mean ?
where is the un ?
when did the un meet ?
why does he say nothing ?
what , then , is the problem ?
the un should not be done away with .
one final point : i am concerned about the role of the international criminal court .
the necessary institutional measures must be taken and the necessary instruments put in place .
the debate is closed .
guidelines for the draft general budget for 2000
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
it is therefore right that he should speak .
we do not know whether there will be an agreement on agenda 2000 .
we do not know whether there will be an agreement between parliament and the council on the overall management of the systems .
this is our aim in terms of priorities .
we consider that considerable efforts need to be made with regard to management .
there is a problem of management here .
applause
i too believe this is the key to the need for reform .
i am sure that this is also in the interests of colleagues in this house and all the other institutions .
applause
mr president , i am speaking on behalf of our group on both reports .
i have two comments in speaking on behalf of my group for the european parliament budget and then for the commission budget .
what are the resources which will be needed ?
what are the real needs ?
i have two specific comments .
a better institutional balance is , of course , absolutely essential .
so i very much welcome our joint call for an increase in the share of development policies in the community budget .
but is that the real reason ?
we will find out in the course of tomorrow and the day after .
i would like to focus on just two questions .
i should now like to focus on two specific aspects of the guidelines for the budget for 2000 .
my own view is that the union 's budget is on quite a different level from that of the member states .
it is very important to increase control of the quality and the sectors in the budget .
it will mean transparency .
it is the question of administrative expenditure .
we cannot accept this .
the debate is closed .
all i can say is that he is right .
i therefore believe that this amendment should not be included .
the debate is closed .
i shall focus on the management of it .
so it seems right and proper to me to draw general conclusions .
that situation does not exist at present .
what remains the same is the objective .
here parliament has a special responsibility to bring about progress through dialogue with the council .
we must put an end to that .
i agree with the debate that has already taken place and with the position of the rapporteur .
that was the problem here .
i do not think that is right .
the debate is closed .
welcome
mr president , on a point of order .
applause
the same applies today .
so what is the situation ?
and that is what this is all about .
applause
in principle , these measures already exist .
your amendment is included in the vote , but later on .
amendment no 3 goes further .
it should be voted first .
on amendment no 12
that is the case , so i cannot put it to the vote .
on amendment no 1
( parliament adopted the resolution )
applause
applause
parliament adopted the resolution
i asked on behalf of those present whether the presidency could reply to the question before the vote today .
i think this is really too much .
there is no problem with the procedure .
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution
that is the first reason .
finally , i did not vote against the resolution .
mr president , i too voted for the resolution .
we do not want information we already know !
that is why i could not vote in favour .
you can see that you have done it very well .
so much the better .
the question now is what conclusions we should draw .
we agree with the content of the report and its conclusions .
it is absolutely vital for these to be under democratic control .
not so very long ago , the union decided to provide food aid for russia .
we supported that as well .
the european parliament should therefore not be party to the agreement .
this it has not done .
thank you .
parliament has now come to the end of its agenda .
statement by the president
agenda
the next item is the order of business .
the following amendments have been proposed .
are there any comments ?
parliament approved the proposal
mrs green has the floor to present this request .
we would ask that it is brought forward and taken at the same time
thank you , mrs green .
parliament approved the request
war !
parliament has therefore already taken the situation into consideration .
the next item is the joint debate on :
if that is the case we must certainly review the issue of parliamentary control .
this is what parliamentary control means .
in other words , we call for these rights only if parliamentary control is possible .
applause
things have to change .
it is time for us to get back to work .
all proposed measures in the justice field must be brought before the european parliament .
it is nothing new .
i will start on a positive note .
i think that is a good thing .
so i shall not comment on whether or not i like some of the amendments .
i believe it is important to draw the attention of the house to this today .
we need much greater cooperation .
there are many activities which are criminal in some countries but not in others .
with regard to fundamental rights , i would say the following .
but they are not sufficient .
instead , i will look at an aspect that , to my mind , is vital and that does not receive enough attention .
but why do young people use drugs ?
yet it has still not been set up .
mr president , i am speaking on behalf of the group of the european people 's party and i think that at this stage we need to take a clear look at the situation .
further , we must improve the public 's access to justice .
the powers of the court of justice should be increased .
nevertheless , i have tabled four amendments which i hope the house and the commission will support , in particular amendment no 2 .
a solution which goes as far as that is not at all necessary .
the way that is achieved is of little interest to most people .
i would like to address a number of points which i believe are essential .
this also applies to all reports on the subject .
this must never become a reality for us .
i hope that parliament takes the same view .
central to the report is the protection of the community 's financial interests .
the union 's current action plan on drugs comes to an end this year .
it is therefore clear that measures adopted at national level should take account of the possible effects which they may have on the global community as a whole .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
yet this intergovernmental policy does not work .
are we not aware of what is going on around us ?
to my mind , this issue is of vital importance .
is this really necessary ?
that is in itself a good decision .
but it should be the last paper .
what we need now is legislation .
nothing has come of it .
if there was , it would have been found by now .
this means that in the areas of asylum and immigration we must force ourselves to think in community terms , and that is the task of this parliament .
for this reason we must open up this second possibility .
i would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is not only the responsibility of the european union .
we cannot debate in the european parliament as if these things had not happened .
that is why today 's reports are so important .
two specific questions remain in relation to the reports .
moreover , further help is on the way , both from the member states and the commission .
the rapporteur questions this approach .
it is very important to have such a system in place .
people should be able to see that what we are doing is having some effect .
a good deal of political will is also needed if we are to make the right decisions during the coming year .
the joint debate is closed .
there are also some issues concerning implementation .
the debate is closed .
so far , so good , but this is where the problems begin .
why these and not others ?
what has the commission to say about this ?
the debate is closed .
that is the reason we support this ; it is not the only reason but a major reason .
we would not even see a reduction of 1 % .
we are trying to do everything at once but this is not the time for that .
we must do one thing at a time .
i do not feel that this is the right time for it , nor is it the right time for the commission 's proposal .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , we welcome this report as a small step in the right direction .
what we need now is for the council of ministers to reach agreement as soon as possible .
the council must now make up its mind .
any increase in these levels is therefore not acceptable .
the debate is closed .
the present proposal could also be implemented using this system .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
the minutes were approved
thank you very much .
unfortunately , there are problems .
however , i do not want to continue this discussion now .
agriculture
the next item is the joint debate on :
we need europe and our children even more so .
the second is that a budget increase is required .
i understand the reasons behind this amendment .
that alone is therefore the aim of these proposals .
proposals have already been made on this .
applause
that is a success .
unfortunately , good things cost money .
i have seen this happen !
i see that you are not pleased .
however , we will support the rapporteur 's proposal on two express conditions .
what is the commission doing while all this is going on ?
we also support the rapporteur on this point .
the question we have to ask ourselves is how long can this continue ?
this is why there is high unemployment .
they are of course being discussed at this very moment .
however , as with all support policies , two points need to be taken into account here .
i therefore support the commission proposal .
i therefore particularly welcome this proposal .
that is why i should like to focus on the future .
nevertheless , i do have a question for the commissioner .
applause
direct access to information by the people must therefore be developed further .
applause
applause
applause
i give the floor to mrs green .
however , we must find a way around the problems .
so be it .
the role of this parliament in recent events has been fundamental .
we would not only support you in doing so but would also encourage you to do so .
i think all of us here very much welcome that .
for this to happen there has to be agreement between the council and parliament on the process .
this is a serious process .
applause
you must reform the commission and its services .
as the present commission too has said , there has to be a new european political and administrative culture .
as you know , this is a central problem .
applause
and that is the last thing we need between commission and parliament .
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
parliament approved the commission proposal
( parliament adopted the resolution )
applause
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
a word or two if i may , mr president .
parliament adopted the resolution
cooperation in this area should continue to be intergovernmental .
the level of these rights must be as high as possible .
the provisions in the field of justice and home affairs should therefore be a matter for national governments .
we think this is an excellent report .
we cannot accept that .
i do not think we should .
it is in this context that we are discussing the proposed joint action today .
we voted against the report in the final vote for the following reasons .
you would almost think that this was of no importance .
cooperation in this area should continue to be intergovernmental .
i have of course also voted in favour of these points .
for these reasons , i voted against the report in the final vote .
i cannot understand why no british member in this house has raised the question of what is going on here .
they should look at what is going on .
if they do , at the very least people should have the right to discuss what kind of system is being brought in .
something has to be done about it .
cooperation in this area should continue to be intergovernmental .
cooperation should , however , be intergovernmental .
on the basis of the above , i voted against this report .
for once , everyone seems to be in agreement .
the social and economic consequences of the present situation will therefore be very serious .
i wish to come back to a point the commissioner made in his speech .
i proposed amendments to this end which were approved by the agriculture committee and which i hope the commission will accept .
that is precisely why we are also prepared to go a step further .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
i should like to congratulate the commission on its initiative .
the committee on legal affairs has supported me and we have put forward a number of amendments .
mr president , on behalf of a considerable majority of my group , i welcome the commission 's proposals .
but when it comes to information rights , this cannot have anything to do with the protection of certain interest groups .
allow me nevertheless to make one or two points .
there is therefore no need for more eu rules in this area .
it should be up to individual countries to establish national rules or set up agreements , as we have done in my own country .
i should also like to thank the commission for its proposal .
there can be no doubt that this directive is needed , as developments during recent years have shown .
however , i do not think the proposal goes far enough .
this is nothing more than that .
mr president , i could have done without this proposal for a directive .
unfortunately , it was not adopted .
that is why it is needed .
it is very important for the european social model .
i thank you for your support .
the debate is closed .
working time
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
in other words , we have to discuss and vote on all these things today and tomorrow .
i am particularly concerned about two areas .
we welcome those agreements .
unfortunately in the road sector there was no agreement between the social partners .
we congratulate the commission on taking an initiative to bring forward legislative proposals .
i really hope that an agreement can be reached there .
one reason for this is the health of the workers .
i believe that protection needs to be provided for both groups .
that is one reason , the workers ' health .
i think that for this reason alone , this is very , very important .
i would see this as particularly important in these two areas .
this should be the main aim of the reports presented today .
but that is not all that is needed .
it may be the last opportunity i have to do this in this house .
two problems still remain .
if it is to be applied in the right way , it is vital that it should have strong support from the social partners .
in this respect , the directive is of value .
having made these few comments , i would in general support the proposal .
any changes which are going to be brought about in this regard can only be done in agreement with the fishing industry in ireland and in europe .
clearly the current answer is no .
the first is safety .
my second point concerns service .
nevertheless , the commission has put the proposals forward .
most of these are acceptable to the commission .
this amendment is therefore not acceptable .
that is to say , the amendment would conflict with the general working time directive .
i thank you for your kind words .
the joint debate is closed .
democracy , rule of law , human rights and fundamental rights
the next item is the joint debate on :
with regard to the council 's common position , i must mention the following issues .
i certainly hope that today 's debate will be the last on this important matter .
this is an important report .
that is why we can support this report more or less in full .
three other amendments which you accepted were important to us , the first of which is to article 2 .
mr president , i believe that these reports are very important .
i am against the two amendments .
i hope that my colleagues will follow the rapporteur 's opinion .
that is why we also support this .
after all , true democracy has only recently been achieved in some european countries .
this will now be possible in 1999 .
that is your point as well .
this is an important thing that , on behalf of the commission , i should say to the house .
the joint debate is closed .
great efforts are being made by all the companies involved .
at present , these amendments do not make much sense .
why ?
mr president , i should first of all like to welcome the work done by the rapporteur and her report .
the whole thing has to be taken in that context .
one last comment .
the commission agreed with the line taken by parliament .
of course , it is not just their effect on the environment that is a major cause for concern ; people 's health is also at risk .
i understand that .
people can live with that .
what will happen then ?
of course , it requires a considerable financial effort .
we have discussed it several times .
i am quite sure this is a question we will return to later in the procedure .
the debate is closed .
that is a competition policy which i cannot support .
that is why i am very much in favour of the best available technology being used .
there must be a rule for this .
i have two comments to make .
finally , one thing is clear .
they have done nothing about the waste problem in ireland .
that is not acceptable to the public in ireland .
so we must look to improve the values here .
i would welcome that .
this is a matter of principle .
we look forward to a successful second reading in parliament after the elections .
the debate is closed .
financial instrument for the environment
we would like life to give greater consideration to the social impact involved , and to employment in particular .
i do not think that the resources will be used in the best way possible if all her amendments are adopted .
that is wrong .
in addition , life needs special funding .
madam president , in principle the life programme is extremely welcome from an environmental point of view .
the debate is closed .
in other countries , very few organisations have become involved .
why do we always think only of industry ?
if we now include services i find this very positive .
so once again we would have adopted an excellent decision here in parliament but it would not actually be put into practice .
there is no end to technology .
now , if i may , i would like to comment on some amendments .
i hope very much that my colleagues - and the commission too - will welcome them .
i believe we all agree with this objective .
a number of our amendments , also tabled by our group , were accepted by a majority in committee .
i wish this were also the case in other member states too .
but why so few ?
as far as the most important of these are concerned , i shall now discuss some of the reasons why the commission cannot accept them .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
allow me to stress certain key points .
we therefore believe that it is only right to implement these measures .
it may be your last contribution to the development of our public health programmes , but you have made a significant contribution .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
agenda
in any case , you can put that question next time or in any other form .
applause
applause
applause
that is why it is , in my view , a good and fair agreement .
applause
our citizens , the people of europe , want integration .
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
we have achieved a quality of cooperation with russia which we for our part will certainly not call in question again .
applause
applause
in relation to the existing member states , it should be said that they too have a very real interest in enlargement .
applause
you will be discussing the development of the conflict today , which i very much welcome .
applause
very good !
applause
applause
many thanks for your attention !
our proposals for rural development have been adopted as they stand .
mr president , the union will not continue to develop with the current 15 member states alone .
that , ladies and gentlemen , is also solidarity .
the commission will fully support such an initiative .
this amendment takes account of the new situation created by the war in kosovo .
applause
applause
applause
the new commission must be able to become what it must become , namely a european government .
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
mr president-in-office of the european council , you took over the presidency during one of the most difficult times the european union has ever had to go through .
we wish you success , because that is also our success , the success of our european union .
many thanks .
applause
applause
applause
applause
i believe it is our political responsibility to do so .
applause
this concerns the intergovernmental conference .
we would like to be involved in the same way as the commission .
applause
of course there should be a new administrative and new political culture , but we need a strong commission .
the european parliament also needs to be fully involved , in the coming period .
one is what you said about kosovo .
the european council has still not provided the resources needed .
i thank him for what he said in relation to the crisis in kosovo .
i should like to deal with some aspects of the common agricultural policy for the moment .
i congratulate you on the progress you are making to date .
i would like to make three comments from a budgetary point of view .
my group was particularly concerned about that .
applause
your idea is a good one .
the council is now saying that the commission can both be and not be at the same time .
there has been a considerable reduction in the resources available from the european community .
let me give you just one example .
we welcome that .
he said that there were three main issues of concern .
that is what we want and that is what we must achieve !
yet that is what we must do today , for even in times of war we must not only think of peace but also work to achieve it .
applause
that costs money .
i agree with you .
applause
but there is one other thing i would ask of you , mr president-in-office of the council .
applause
that is the wrong direction to take .
i hope you agree with me there .
but it is just the first step .
mr president-in-office , you mentioned the issue of institutional reform .
we support this .
and then there is kosovo .
we had to do so .
so i think it will take a great deal of hard work to reach an agreement .
applause
applause
we really do want to work on this .
i thank the members of this parliament and the president for giving me an opportunity to speak here .
i wish you much success in your work and much success for all of us who are in and for europe .
applause
many thanks , commissioner !
let us do so !
applause
that is something we called for .
the debate is closed .
applause
applause
we therefore voted against paragraph 4 of the resolution .
it will not help to improve economic and social cohesion .
and france .
i would like to see more market .
this simply does not make sense .
this has always been the policy of the labour government .
this must become a priority in public health policy in the european union .
this is a compromise .
report as a whole : against .
i voted against both reports because in my view we should not create a kind of social union within the european union .
i believe we should keep to national rules in this area .
that is why i am against these two ' social policy ' reports .
everyone is aware that road transport is one of the sectors in which the social europe does not exist .
situation in kosovo
i hope we will be able to present final proposals to parliament soon .
applause
applause
there is no point .
i do not understand it !
applause
thank you , mr president-in-office .
it is not enough to talk !
applause
this is not the president 's problem ; this particular case is an issue for the political group .
it is supported by the large majority of public opinion in europe .
these are our proposals , some of which date back a long time .
that is the way forward .
applause
come on !
applause
let us respect them , even if we do not agree with them at all .
having said this , mr president , i am only going to say two things at this stage .
it is free , and members are free to speak .
mr president , i agree with what the council president has said today about kosovo , and also with what the commissioner said .
in kosovo , it is about to happen all over again .
these questions are important .
respect peace !
get out of their way !
that did not work .
we did nothing at that time .
may i now make one final point , mr president .
it is back .
war is never an end in itself .
mr president , i speak on behalf of my group and i will begin with what is most important .
so be it , then .
the conflict is after all a european one .
but that is not to say that the eu has no role .
and fight not just in the air .
europe should stop and think !
i believe that this is a very serious problem
it was not adopted and this instrument is not available to us , an instrument that would today allow us to deal with this situation in a very different way .
so , we want peace but he does not , and it is important to say so .
but there is more to it than that .
applause
could it be that all this never happened ?
what is the point ?
this is the question i think we should ask , and above all the answer that should be given .
applause
the debate is closed .
that is what we really need to know today .
it remains to be seen !
we will find out in the next few months whether that will be the case .
but we do not know . we will find out in the future .
we must ask it how it will decide in a given situation .
i agree .
this , i feel , is extremely important .
it is extremely important that the scientific basis should be in order , so that the right decisions can be reached .
there will continue to be a few cases .
we are well on the way to doing so but we must continue to work at it .
we have to pay far more attention to matters of agricultural production and food production .
who will still protect the consumers ?
one more question , who will take the lead here ?
however , i welcome this report .
mr president , i will give a very short and rather more political answer .
question time ( council )
i will answer it in political rather than legal terms .
i would like to ask him the following questions .
there are other member states which do not want it in this form .
thank you very much for that answer .
and it will continue to do so .
so if new developments force us to change our position and to take new decisions , we shall do so .
so what other means of pressure do you propose ?
we have a few reasons to doubt this .
we would really like to know .
after all , the situation is quite different .
the council does not currently consider that the use of other instruments is appropriate . i have already said that .
i would therefore ask that you all try to keep to time ; this will benefit us , as we will be able to get through more questions .
believe me , i take this problem just as seriously as you do .
i have already done so .
it is not my job nor is it the council 's job to decide what regions of europe receive aid under what criteria .
that is up to the commission .
is the council aware of this situation ?
in any case i would like to thank you for your answer .
thank you , mr president-in-office .
the rules of the amsterdam treaty apply here .
mr president-in-office , this is not the first time this question is being discussed here in the european parliament either .
it has often come up during question time .
let me perhaps point out the following and ask you to take it further or even to provide some information if possible .
no decisions were taken , since this was not a meeting of the council of the european union .
mr president , there is no answer to this .
what did they decide ? what did they discuss ?
mr president , i should like an answer .
i do not believe the situation is any different in any member state of the european union .
and we know the subject matter .
ladies and gentlemen , this will be our last question .
you have the floor for a point of order .
that is why i asked you to let me speak , and not so that i could speak for a second time on the same issue .
in turn , the president must give you an answer on what has happened to your question .
why ?
what is the reason for this ?
applause
applause
i hope that they will be taken into account for everyone 's benefit .
applause
so in this sense we can also accept the positive side to this crisis .
applause
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
in practice , this will mean a new intergovernmental conference .
if it does not happen , we can offer up thanks .
for example , people sometimes tell us that the cost of enlargement is too high .
these people have no experience .
' .
that applies to every country these days .
the same applies to the other countries on the list .
they form a whole .
applause
another area in which great efforts are needed is agriculture .
applause
i would like to make just one other point .
in my view there is much that can be done .
there is clearly a need for institutional reform if we want to remain effective .
but in turn , we also have our own requirements .
and i believe that this is very important .
and it is clear that they are making good progress in many areas , the economy for example , and also with the democratic and political criteria .
applause
what more must they do ?
now or never it must become clear just how serious we are about this common policy .
and how is the problem of solidarity discussed ?
it is a difficult process .
i hope things will move quickly , commissioner .
however , i have a few questions for the commission on this .
today we turn our attention to the other six .
but at the end of the day it is the summit itself which must decide when to start negotiations .
we are working on this at the moment and will return to it as quickly as possible .
there are still a number of important aspects concerning the rule of law and democracy which still need attention and where further progress is necessary .
now for a general comment on the economic criteria .
the question is not only whether the countries are able to adopt the legislation but also whether they are able to implement it in practice ?
we know the political efforts this has required .
we also hope for better times in this respect .
i should like to say the following on the subject of economic developments .
mr president , i will end here .
in may 1998 the commission adopted a communication on accession strategy in the environmental field .
the joint debate is closed .
these then are the proposals .
this must not be allowed to happen and the commission must understand this .
since then we have received support for this review in the course of what has been a very open dialogue with parliament .
this support for one of the most important european competition policy reforms is clearly of great importance .
it will take some time to do this .
that is not good policy as it does not protect competition .
a good example of this is the british market .
it is not being responsible .
this is simply how i see it .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
your comments will be included in the minutes of the sitting .
you can decide .
mr president , on a point of order .
i shall do as you request .
you are right that this is a problem .
i do not know where you have your information from .
well , look at that : you mentioned the president and here he is !
the minutes were approved
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the procedure has become more open and effective as a result .
thank you for your attention .
applause
applause
i thank you and them .
applause
this house thanks you for your work .
i was wrong .
i support him in his call for greater transparency .
that is certainly necessary .
perhaps i might mention a few of the many successful initiatives taken .
it is an increasing problem .
i would like to thank parliament for its assistance in this matter .
it is a good report and , overall , i agree with everything it says .
this is essential if a good job of work is to be done .
the debate is closed .
parliament has a number of problems with this proposal .
there is also a financial problem in the council .
we will be voting for all the amendments , madam president .
there is a lack of cooperation between member states .
the debate is closed .
the subject is not new .
no , that is not the case .
we are prepared to discuss external costs .
this is something we are all in favour of .
i put this down in an amendment , so i can only agree with her .
of course we must .
that is the best way to go about it .
but that is not true .
finally , it is extremely important that we should make this a european system , which is currently by no means the case .
i would like to speak on a point of order , mr president .
i do not think that this is in line with our rules of procedure .
can we agree on that ?
after the vote on amendment no 5
before the vote on amendment no 1
after the vote on amendment no 11
if you think there is another issue , we can look at that .
however , at this time , i have no reason to change this practice and the way we implement this rule .
applause
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is not a question of whether we are in favour of social cohesion .
we are all in favour of social cohesion .
applause
parliament adopted the decision
you do not need to ask it again .
applause
on the subject of the majority required , however , i think it is essential that parliament should know what majority it needs to take decisions .
parliament agreed to this proposal
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
on paragraph 5
that is the problem i have with paragraph 5 .
that was the agreement .
applause
( parliament adopted the resolution )
joint resolution on kosovo
these issues have to be raised .
we have to look at respect for all human life .
we cannot put one human life above another .
mr president , there are many extremely good points in this resolution .
the time has come for europe to take specific initiatives to find a political solution to the problem for the good of all the people in the area .
that is the issue .
however , with the best will in the world , we cannot change the past .
make of this what you will .
we are all aware of the importance of transport , particularly in terms of economic development .
there are two important points here as far as my group is concerned .
i do not think this is the right approach .
i would not go as far as this .
this is quite unacceptable .
let me make a few comments about the points of concern .
the debate is closed .
as a result , the proposal was referred back to the committee on transport .
given the present circumstances , it is difficult for me to vote for or against the resolution by the transport committee .
that is the position .
now we have to find a solution .
i ask you , is this what europe is all about ?
experience in a number of member states has shown this to be the case .
the debate is closed .
of course , european legislation will be required in this area .
the committee on legal affairs does not have many amendments to put forward here .
i hope that the commission can go along with this .
this is a growth area and should create a large number of jobs .
i thank the rapporteur .
there is no such thing .
the debate is closed .
financial services framework for action
mr president , commissioner , europe is working towards the creation of a single market in financial services .
finally , how can the commission , parliament and the council take forward this process ?
the debate is closed .
that is the second point .
instead , i want to talk about political responsibility , because that concerns all of us .
safety has no price .
nothing .
we say , enough is enough !
but we need to look to the future , and i have two , or in fact three proposals to put forward .
the issue is one of the european union 's priorities , and we must welcome that fact .
the joint debate is closed .
this is why i think the european union and , of course , the united nations must do everything they can to help in the only way they can , to ensure that the elections are indeed democratic .
all it will cost is a little money and effort .
the joint debate is closed .
i hope you are able to do that on behalf of this parliament .
that is the one and only road to freedom and stability in the country .
i hope that colleagues will support this resolution and vote with us on it .
the joint debate is closed .
we voted against this report for the following reasons :
that is why i voted against it .
there will clearly be different views about the necessary reforms .
we should pay particular attention to this last point .
too much has been allowed to go on for too long .
both the commission 's proposals and the council 's decisions should be public and available to all .
this concerns each and every one of us .
what position will the european union take in the wto negotiations due to start at the end of this year ?
the point i have made is for future reference , so to speak .
we have taken a major step in that direction today .
i support the idea that agriculture should be seen as part of a rural development strategy .
and we must welcome that .
and this will all benefit the people of europe .
but let me tell you how things are in reality .
in each case , the children concerned have been the victims of a real crime .
i would like to draw attention to a number of points which i think are important here .
it was a difficult decision for the commission .
madam president , i wish to make just one comment .
i think the commissioner has already said which amendments are being accepted .
no , that is clearly not the case .
can you tell us which amendments are being accepted by the commission ?
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
the minutes were approved
statement by the president
applause
mr president , i do not know how you can take such decisions .
was such a decision taken in the context of a commission which is dealing with current business ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i think that we need to look at this question in the context of the treaty .
applause
i do not think they are .
the position is that the legal protection of consumers will be the responsibility of the committee on legal affairs and citizens ' rights .
why ?
what was the first vote on yesterday ?
mr president , i think you need to find out what we voted on first .
that is why i tabled these amendments on behalf of my group .
it is important that more time is taken with future changes .
thank you .
the discussion is now closed .
i am pleased about that , because this is a serious and urgent matter .
europe must move quickly in this area .
this will increase .
the amsterdam treaty is one area where we can do something .
not i , to be sure !
unemployment has already been mentioned .
there is still a great deal to be done here .
that is very important to me .
applause
applause
we also called for a commission initiative in this area , but nothing has happened .
once again , nothing has happened .
mr president , allow me to say one more thing .
let me therefore welcome her here on behalf of you all .
in addition , i think their basic position is the right one .
i would like to thank you all for that too !
this applies particularly to the world of work .
they address economic and social issues in their report and , in particular , the problem of access to the labour market .
applause
that would be real democracy .
in the economic sector we are always talking about the free market , and rightly so .
that is not true .
applause
applause
the report is clearly the result of much hard work .
i should like once more to thank parliament for this report .
the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the resolution
we did not vote in favour of this report .
that is why the committee on agriculture and rural development would like the commission to answer the following questions .
that demands a great deal of work , commissioner .
i hope not , and i would like to hear what the commission has to say on this point .
i believe this resolution has to address four problem areas and that each of them is actually very important in its own right .
but progress is not being made .
the work on the agenda 2000 decisions must begin now .
mr president , i have just three comments to make on this debate .
finally , many general questions have been raised in connection with the common agricultural policy , as well as in connection with the wto negotiations .
the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the resolution
however , it is also true that very special measures are required .
without people , there is nothing to protect and nothing to do .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
applause
that should provide work for everyone !
the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the resolution
are there any comments ?
however , one of the new rules is less important within the house than outside it .
applause
that therefore is the relevant decision .
applause
i should like this particular part to be put to the vote .
however , this decision was not put to the vote because it was not necessary .
the minutes were approved
i would like to make a point of order , mr president , regarding order in the house .
agenda
well , these negotiations are still under way .
it is in any case less than clear why we need to deal with the agreement during this parliamentary term .
nothing new will come out .
so i have a problem .
we have a problem .
we have received the resolutions from all the groups .
but let me start with the specific case in question .
i will end this contribution with a comment of a general nature .
applause
the debate is closed .
that is why we have approved this resolution .
the debate is closed .
it is for that reason that it was necessary then to review the rules .
that was the main problem !
that has now happened .
it is important that we now have agreement between the rules of procedure , the treaty and the financial regulation .
however , on the basis of the opinion of its legal service , the commission should just like to make a comment of a legal and institutional nature .
thank you .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
and secondly , for the first time , job creation is seen as the most important aim of economic policy .
this would be wrong .
with this in mind , i ask you to vote in favour of this report .
can the commission and the council guarantee that they will receive it ?
the fact is that structural measures and labour market policy are only part of the answer to the unemployment problem , which we are all concerned about .
let us take the example of the euro .
we shall never get a serious strategy for growth that way .
should we step up coordination of economic policy ?
no !
i believe that this is right and proper !
with help from the commissioner , we have achieved some progress here , but the council is not doing enough .
it is precisely these areas which offer great opportunities .
well , you could say that .
last year it was possible to bring unemployment down to 10 % .
so what type of decisions can we expect ?
our opinion , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , is that it we have not achieved the right balance .
and it will be .
why ?
no , that is not on .
i shall not go back over this .
the first of these is the budgetary policy .
the second issue of concern is employment .
here again i ask the question .
we are pleased to find that all these points are referred to in the draft resolution .
you are right to stress that the european social fund must play a key role in support of the european employment strategy .
the joint debate is closed .
the commission adopted this decision last week .
this was not part of the negotiations and nor could it be .
we have achieved a really good result .
it is vital that we have the office now , and not in two years ' time or never .
but that is far from enough .
the whole question of what the office needs cannot be left to the commission .
that is what we need .
that should certainly give it enough to do .
i should like to single out three aspects of this .
it could set an example for the way our institutions could work together in other areas in the future .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we should now therefore move to a decision on this item .
i understand that particular problem .
we should close it down today .
i used to be one myself .
i should like to thank all colleagues .
the committee on budgetary control wanted to go further .
this is not possible .
our purpose is to state from the point of view of parliament where we stand at the present time .
that is an important point in itself .
for that reason it is a contribution from the committee on budgetary control and will not be voted by parliament as such .
finally , there is the economic and social committee , the only area where we do have a problem .
it was possible to talk to him .
that is unacceptable .
we will simply not put up with it .
the committee supported me .
that cannot be allowed to go on .
it is just a change of opinion within the court .
i wish it all the best .
six reports are on the agenda .
we all know what has happened .
i hope that the new parliament and the new commission will make use of them .
it is clear that nothing has been done .
it should be clear to everyone that this paragraph must remain .
i now turn to the house itself .
the reports were adopted in committee without any amendments .
i should like to ask you to see to this , because as i have said , the rapporteur was not present .
firstly , responsibility must be seen to be accepted .
it is available from the commission .
that part has been most open .
all this work has been done and now it is for the next commission to take the political initiatives .
i would also stress that the guidelines presented by the rapporteur are part of a major reform movement .
there have been issues where parliament and commission have agreed and there has been progress .
they have been implemented in some services but not in all .
that is the issue the new commission must pay a lot of attention to .
much remains to be done .
i agree with three major conclusions of the rapporteur .
we have already made an effort and i am sure we can continue .
but it is very clear that this work must continue .
the third area which is very important is the global reform of financial regulations .
there also the first communication has been done .
that is extremely important .
thank you , commissioner .
i will talk to him about the issue .
the debate is closed .
nevertheless , mr president , commissioner , parliament can go no further .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but i can say one or two things which i think are of some importance now .
several points give me cause for some concern .
this is the situation in which we find ourselves .
i should like to thank you very much for that , but you alone are not the commission and the council .
i would therefore ask you to vote in favour of this motion for a resolution .
let us consider where we stand today .
you said that it was a legal and economic issue .
is it a legal issue ?
let us just consider where we are .
and you say that we need new scientific data .
go on , why not ?
things cannot be left to the market alone .
madam president , i will do my best .
that of course we can do .
the answer is no !
it has not happened yet . i hope it will happen more fully very soon .
there is no fundamental conflict between consumer protection and trade .
the debate is closed .
just think what may happen .
it is just a small part of the answer .
but it may offer a solution in the area of services at local and regional level .
parliament had to put pressure on the council and the commission for a long time to get where we are today .
that makes no sense these days .
i really cannot see any sense in that .
some of them are very important .
that is no mean number !
the number of jobs in this sector may also increase again .
i support the amendments which have been tabled , and i hope that the council and the commission will do so too .
why did not we do it before ?
and then i have a specific question for the commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i would point out that i am in the right place , as ever .
mr president , i also have a point to make concerning the minutes .
i would like an answer here .
applause
the minutes were approved
decision on urgent procedure
parliament agreed to urgent procedure
applause
europe must be able to do its share .
the conditions for this are in place , as we will see today .
the people of europe expect this of us .
applause
applause
i consider this to be a positive development .
i have already mentioned the reforms that could and must be carried out in the commission .
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
so as the present commission has said , a new european political and administrative culture is required .
there is a third major policy direction which you will have to address , and you referred to it just now .
applause
for my group that would be a serious and significant priority .
this is important .
that is essential .
applause
without a strong commission , parliament cannot hope for any major reform of the institutions , which has been put off for years .
we have no need of a new president at present .
you referred to the euro .
however , you have not made any significant comment with regard to this request .
this is a completely unacceptable state of affairs .
we wish you every success .
the european union must not be seen by the people only as a single market , it must be a europe of common values and a common culture .
we should talk about what we have in common !
i am pleased to have heard the word responsibility said so many times this morning .
and just look at our europe .
that we expect of you .
however , the subject today is the future .
mr president , i wish to address just one issue .
that is not true !
that is my plan .
i shall not speak about defence .
let that be clear !
this applies not only here ; we must make a total , general commitment to this effect because it is part of our overall objectives .
applause
i did not receive an answer to my question .
parliament adopted the decision
however , this amendment actually concerned the paragraph on the proposal for a decision .
we shall look at it again .
but since the amendment was not adopted , there is no problem .
parliament adopted the resolution
that is a good principle .
this is not currently the case .
however , in both cases the provisions are important and must be adopted under the same conditions as the main text itself .
we decided on this even though the committee 's amendments were not adopted .
but that can be discussed .
'
we voted against the report for the following reasons :
this is not true .
for these reasons we will vote against it .
this was actually said by one of our colleagues .
i cannot call that into question .
but to a certain extent , the council and parliament must also accept some responsibility for this crisis .
this amendment was tabled by the green group .
situation in kosovo
that is absolutely certain .
they also include the security of all states in the region , the same security for all under international guarantee .
the second is economic development .
this is yet another reason why we need to stand up to him .
applause
russia has become more involved , which we very much welcome .
many issues remain open .
this is absolutely vital .
applause
mr president , on a point of order .
but allow me first of all , mr president-in-office , commissioner , to express my group 's full support for the line you have taken here today .
secondly , as already mentioned , the united nations must play a crucial role in the peace process that now needs to begin .
i support you on this point too , mr president-in-office .
this is not possible , nor would it make sense .
i therefore agree fully with the view which you expressed , mr president-in-office , and also the commissioner .
my final point concerns the regional approach .
i believe that the regional approach we have been taking is no longer sufficient , and we must find a new one .
clear support is required from this house .
our reply must be : ' europe is peace ! ' .
we support everything the president-in-office said in this context .
those of us who are concerned about this hope that we are wrong .
but we must do it .
that , i think , would have been unacceptable to everyone .
that , i think , is quite unacceptable .
it has to stop now .
we must be absolutely clear on that .
mr president , there is a just political solution .
follow it !
you can follow it and provide a real solution .
what needs to be done ?
could the presidency give us an account of the victims ?
it is time to put forward a political solution to what is a political problem .
i will do the same here today for the last time .
i am not going to talk about the future .
what interests me is ' how ' .
mr president , this is i think the second or third time we have discussed this issue .
i actually believe that , from the humanitarian point of view , the problem is one of coordination .
there are two further , perhaps rather more political points that i would make .
we hear the call for a political solution .
applause
the question should be : what must a political solution achieve ?
a political solution must achieve an end to violence .
applause
applause
he would like that .
and why ?
because then he would have what he wanted .
applause
it is a question of european security and of the future of europe .
what must it take ?
this is a question we must ask ourselves .
applause
applause
applause
thank you , mr president-in-office .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
europe is a power in the world .
we should therefore not make light of the treaty .
this is a success for all of us , and we must continue down this road .
clearly we must change .
that should be our main focus in the next parliament .
russia is indeed the most important problem in our foreign policy .
we do not take it seriously .
these are the things we need to think about .
i should like to look both back a little and forward a little .
i think we are all agreed on one thing .
in the course of the last parliamentary term , i have done my best to further that process .
i am very much in favour of the common strategy towards russia , which the president-in-office mentioned .
clear progress has been achieved here .
thank you very much indeed , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
to date we have not had any response from the council to the draft .
instead the council has put forward its own draft which is not acceptable to parliament .
do you expect us to be able to vote on such a text ?
i do not know what your reasons are , but they are not very important .
when are they to take place ?
they will never take place !
so why not ?
there is absolutely no problem with this .
applause
our own interests are clearly not a matter of great priority for us as members of the european parliament .
parliament then makes the final decision .
mr president , parliament and the council are of one mind .
parliament and the council are agreed on this .
this is the only way to a solution , because i think this is the most important point .
let us agree to start with what we have before us , discuss matters and reach an agreement as soon as possible .
nevertheless , it is essential for each party to be quite clear as to its role under the treaty .
most of the points in the amendment refer to aspects that have already been approved by parliament .
nevertheless , we must keep two points very much in mind .
why ?
you know my group .
those exist , it is true .
that means giving and taking .
we all agree on the objectives that we wish to achieve .
but what the council has now done is to present us with a completely new text .
applause
it is now or never .
and now we have reached this point .
that is not to say that i welcome the council 's proposal .
today we are concerned with the fundamental issues .
there too , there were two systems .
a solution has to be reached now .
this issue has been taken into account .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
statement by the president
madam president , i would like to ask for your help .
in view of this , i am really not prepared to speak here .
i hope our colleagues will also be with us soon .
we could do that .
it is a good report in my view and its content is entirely relevant .
i therefore fully support this idea .
the problem is simply a lack of resources .
we will also have a new commission .
that number is three times what it was for this year , for example .
our role is to ensure that there is transparency .
the debate is closed .
the institutions have already , for that reason , agreed to review the situation in the light of developments .
this has always been made clear by the commission .
the debate is closed .
that cannot be right !
that is simply not acceptable , and i shall give you two reasons why .
we do not know if he will continue to be the commissioner for transport policy .
i can understand that .
in the time since then , a great deal of work has been put into trying to achieve the present state of progress in all the community institutions .
we have always done that .
the debate is closed .
let us consider the proposal .
i have to say that to my own member state government and to others who have taken that view .
i believe that the amendments tabled by the environment committee have done precisely that .
we accept that .
i shall refer to three amendments .
this would be to the benefit of both business and consumers .
i shall just refer to two other points which have been raised in the debate .
the debate is closed .
this has been a significant success for parliament and also for both the commission and the member states in council .
we have shown that ' where there 's a will , there 's a way ' .
so i am very pleased with this .
this is her last report in her last parliament .
this is a very good consumers ' report .
this is excellent work done by this parliament .
in fact , in the three years we have been able to work together in such a way that finally this directive is approved .
the debate is closed .
civil protection
the debate is closed .
i would ask you to support this report .
i should like to thank the members of the environment committee for the support they have already given to my report in committee .
parliament has tabled five amendments .
amendment no 4 is also unacceptable .
amendment no 5 is also unacceptable to us .
the debate is closed .
that has only happened to a very small extent .
mr president , i should firstly also like to express my thanks to the rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
now we have that for most legislation .
that is very important .
i just wanted to mention these points because they are important to me .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
the minutes were approved
this is what we are doing and we will have to continue our humanitarian work for a very long time .
but it is not enough .
applause
thank you very much .
mr president , i should like to thank you for this assessment which you have presented to parliament .
applause
i thank you on behalf of my group for that .
applause
may your future go well .
applause
this does not always happen .
i would like to stress three aspects of your work .
applause
that is important .
this was essential .
there was no way out of it ; we had to face reality .
i hope that we get there .
i believe you had a very successful term of office , mr president .
i thank you for it .
that is something we must continue to achieve right up to the end .
mr president , i want to make a point of order that is a matter of form and will take only a moment .
so there is still some way to go .
the next item is the joint debate on :
i now come to the matter in hand .
let me say a few words on these points .
unemployment is the most urgent social problem of the present time .
we need to tell the people of europe that their basic rights apply in the same way at european level as at national level .
we also need a european security and defence policy if we are to implement a common foreign and security policy .
thank you for your attention .
applause
the new president will need the support of the european parliament to make a success of his term of office .
the situation in kosovo will of course be discussed .
this is all the more significant in the context of the kosovo crisis .
should we go further ?
certainly .
because there is a need for more europe , there is a need for europe to have a role in the world .
we know all that .
that is the point !
why ?
because europe demands it , because europe needs strong institutions !
so they shall be put to the vote tomorrow .
i would congratulate him , too , on his work while in office .
this does not mean , however , that this will not develop in the future and perhaps this should develop .
we are in the best position to help .
a decision must be taken to make a start on political union .
i know the will is there .
that is a most important point !
my second point concerns the common foreign and security policy .
i would like to see progress made in the common foreign and security policy .
applause
we certainly do not wish to take the place of the governments , who will have to take the decisions .
i would point out once again that you would have the last word .
this is what we hope to see .
the president-in-office of the council rightly said that unemployment is the most urgent social problem of our time .
a second step forward should be to establish better standards and values for a social europe .
the european union must keep talking and move things even further forward .
mr president , i support the proposal for peace and stability .
that is what we expect of the member states .
my third point concerns the institutional reforms .
they are all there in the amsterdam treaty .
they are all there in the various institutions concerned with security in europe .
it is simply a question of political will .
the debate is closed .
agenda 2000
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , i would like to make a point of order .
it is now up to the european parliament to decide on agenda 2000 .
what we have before us is what the 15 can achieve at this point in time .
thank you for your attention !
applause
that was a success for europe during a difficult time .
applause
thank you very much . i will do that .
welcome
applause
applause
i see that on paragraph 1 you want to begin with amendment no 2 .
applause
so everyone will naturally know what they will have to vote on later .
we are not going to open a debate on the rules now .
we do not want that , which is why we will not take part in the vote .
very well , that is your right .
we note the fact that you are present , but not taking part in the vote .
that is the decision which has been taken .
as always , i accept responsibility for the decisions which i take , be they right or wrong .
parliament adopted the resolution
applause
i should like to thank all my colleagues for the way we have been able to work together over the past 10 years .
we no longer believe in them .
i would like to make one final comment , madam president .
the social europe does not concern him .
we cannot accept that .
applause from the left
i therefore cannot give you a free hand to carry out this role .
he did not say a word about the europe of people .
with the situation as it is , it is important that the new commission should begin work as soon as possible .
we do not want a united states of europe , but a europe of nations .
' .
madam president , i was not aware of that .
we have to look for change .
that is why i had to vote against him .
i know that you , madam president , have a different view .
that is what is at issue here .
i share that view .
this is why i was prepared to adopt the council 's text .
yet the report is a small step in the right direction .
i do not support the common position on this directive .
i will be voting today in favour of greater rights for consumers across the european union .
many thanks and i wish you all the best !
what is this all about ?
of course not .
we cannot take yet another step back from our development policy principles .
are you in favour of it or are you against it ?
' it is quite clear that if something is not done now , at this stage , we are going to have a defence aspect to the eu .
it should be .
the eu is not a state , and should not become one .
so on the american side , we have actions .
and on the european side , we have words .
this is something we need to debate .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is and has been the wish of the council , the commission and parliament to achieve three objectives by means of agenda 2000 .
but it is also true that we have come very , very close to doing so .
but so can parliament !
we would not have carried off this success without having her on our side .
with our decisions on agenda 2000 we will make the european union more able to move into the future .
i have to say that , within this framework , the commission proposals on agenda 2000 were a step in the right direction .
at that time it was unacceptable for parliament .
we have achieved major results .
however , other members of my group will talk about these aspects .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first let me turn to the positive aspects .
however , the price is very high .
i regard that as the main problem with the new regulation .
but that is not a reform !
but what will happen in the future ?
no , no , no and no .
this we believe was a success .
but let us be clear about what we are voting for today .
clear guidelines were needed as to the practical implementation of the principle .
but the cohesion fund is more than this .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as rapporteur , i am very pleased for two reasons .
i would therefore like to thank the commission , the council and all our colleagues who have supported us .
and let me say again to the council : you have been aware of these demands since the beginning of the year .
it would certainly be a service to the cause !
it is now time to look at enlargement .
the council , however , decided to follow the commission proposal .
europe is able to act !
let me also take this opportunity to say something about the eu 's future structural policy as a whole .
overall this is a good start .
applause
would it be possible for the commission to give a clear statement on how these funds can be used ?
little has been said about monitoring agricultural expenditure .
is this possible ?
little remains of those criteria .
why ?
we will see how things turn out .
i want an agreement , but not just any agreement .
the funding is a contribution to the projects .
however , the total amount has been in doubt .
so i just want to go into a few very specific questions .
i also want to point out quite clearly that such important initiatives as the peace initiative also come under it .
i would like to say a few words about the social fund .
in fact parliament 's support for and contribution to the reform has been crucial .
very different views have also been expressed in today 's debate .
let me make my position clear .
applause
this is the last debate on the future of the common agricultural policy in which you will be taking part in this house .
applause
this would not be in the interests of the union and its policies .
we shall now move on to the general debate .
as a result , i must say once again that i am not going to vote in favour of agenda 2000 .
question time ( council )
you know the rules here .
it is not a question here of the presidency 's view but of what the council says .
mr president , my point of order is quite clear .
so i cannot give you the floor for that question .
i can only give you an answer agreed by the two states concerned , which you mention in your question .
i cannot go any further than that .
i must ask you to put this question to the commission .
i put that to you as a political question and i expect a political answer .
you know the rules of question time .
after that you can have your political answer .
but i am not allowed to express it here .
after all they are our partners and will one day become our partners in the european union .
but to date the commission has made no such proposal .
does public health not always take priority ?
with due respect , mr president-in-office , there really is something which you do not mention in your reply .
this is another question which seems out of context .
since we are not yet at the end of may , i am not in a position to tell you what form these proposals will take .
will the council do everything possible to ensure this ?
- because it is crucial .
thank you , mr president-in-office , for your information .
something still has to be done and more has to be done to meet the needs of these children .
i take a different view from you , but that is not the point here .
according to my information , this legal case will in fact very soon be brought before the european court of justice , which is why this is all i can say by way of an answer .
that is what the council has done !
that is the council 's job and it has done it .
mr president , i should like to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
i do not think more can be done in this matter .
mr president , i wish to thank the president-in-office for the information he has given .
in my answer i did not even list all the initiatives we have already taken .
there are a number of others .
there is also a new initiative by the united nations security council .
thank you for your reply , even though it was not really much of an answer .
i would like to ask you this : will you in no way take responsibility for this ?
you could work in cooperation with him .
the same applies to the presidency .
the situation is not what you think .
is that the question ?
i should like to thank the council for its answer .
the council cannot make any statement about the internal organisation of the commission .
that is the commission 's own business .
you will have to address this question to the commission .
the council cannot make any comment .
i also wanted to ask another question .
mr president , i should like to thank the president-in-office for his response .
but let me tell you that i do not agree with your assessment of the matter .
the european parliament 's political discussions on agenda 2000 will then come to a close with tomorrow 's vote .
i will mention four main areas .
i should like to stress this point .
this is completely unacceptable .
i do not think so !
i hope that we can work together to achieve further progress in this area .
i very much welcome them both .
we are going to vote against , as we did in committee .
as well as that we have two major problems with the commission 's proposal .
too much is left up to the member states .
that is why we are voting against this report .
we talk about the european agricultural model .
so what will we do then ?
and that is the third problem : funding .
we are aware of this problem .
we need other resources .
mr president , mr president-in-office , i shall now change the subject . i am speaking on behalf of the committee on budgetary control .
but that does not apply to the fisheries policy .
how did agenda 2000 take these views into account ?
ask the political groups to give you a little more time .
how will i be able to stop them ?
i therefore call on parliament to vote in favour of this report .
i hope i will be back .
we do not have a list system .
democracy and states based on the rule of law form the basis of the european union .
it is an agreement which we can welcome .
there is therefore no reason for it to continue to exist in its present form .
by now everything has already been said at least once in the house on the subject which we are dealing with today .
however , this alone is not sufficient .
i am sure that you will not mind if i do not quite use up all of my two minutes ' speaking time .
i welcome the fact that the individual member states have the opportunity to take part in the decision making .
however , i should like to get back to the point .
the final decision on agenda 2000 is a good european compromise .
parliament supported both initiatives , but the council wanted just three and we already had three .
so there were two too many .
mr president , perhaps i could make just one final comment to the commissioner .
if this was the case in the past , then it should certainly remain so in the future .
we can now see the results of this .
applause
they do not come from these areas .
this is not everything .
i think that we will also benefit from equal .
this is the last speech i will be making in the european parliament .
applause
i am content with that .
it is a compromise - a compromise that was a good one for my region .
on agriculture the proposals will not improve the position of my farmers .
you have been a good president .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 am .
parliament has four priorities .
that we have found unacceptable .
but this was far from the case .
but this was far from the case .
of course , we are going to take what is on offer .
now i know much better and i share that in common with this house .
the debate is closed .
that would be the result .
i continue to believe that social dialogue is important and that we must also discuss the consequences of social dialogue .
there is also the matter of social security .
i do not believe it is possible to ask the social partners to deal with the social security consequences of their agreement .
we have seen it during this debate .
i welcome this agreement between the social partners .
we have here an important agreement between management and labour .
the debate is closed .
i look forward to being able to discuss this with the council in the future .
there are certain concerns about some of the amendments .
the commission is prepared to accept all of the proposed amendments .
applause
i thank you very much for that .
we have achieved a lot on social policy .
the debate is closed .
we need to talk about those issues .
and there is so much that is positive about this agreement , so in this case the best thing we can do is support it .
in other words , many groups have expressed their concern to us and we share their concerns . first , the negotiations are not over yet .
mr president , the amsterdam treaty has been in force for just a few days .
there has been no new commission paper on which we could make a decision .
it is precisely this which i do not understand .
however , this problem of how a parliament makes a decision is of fundamental importance for me .
now let me tell you about the progress achieved to date in the trade negotiations .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i actually voted in favour .
i think that the wrong terms are used here .
he will then take a decision , as i say .
that is all .
the minutes were approved
you are quite right .
this is no way to approach such issues .
mr president , this is the last debate we shall be having on european justice policy in this parliamentary term .
what has been achieved in these five years ?
again , no .
some good progress has been made , but more could have been done .
i have only one or two comments to make .
mr president , may i begin by saying ' well done ' to the presidency .
that was not the case .
we need to be clear about this if we are to avoid problems with any cases that may come before the court .
what has now taken place is the implementation of that decision .
the debate is closed .
this is a very important area .
i feel this is important .
but again , we have to be aware that consumers need protection .
in my opinion in some areas we have not .
we should vote down that amendment .
for that reason , our group will be voting against them .
the majority of our group will vote against this amendment , because they believe , as i do , that it is out of place here .
that , of course , is consumer protection too .
i should like to refer to one or two of these proposals .
my group will therefore be voting against many of the amendments on these points .
what rules apply , and what rights do we have if something goes wrong ?
we must be able to put a stop to this .
i would like to ask the commissioner something .
let us continue along this road !
greater transparency must be achieved in this area .
there are , however , a number of amendments the commission is not in a position to accept for one of the following four reasons .
the debate is closed .
we in parliament have said that this is one of our european policy priorities .
mr president , i should like to speak on a point of order .
that will not be possible .
tomorrow , parliament will not be able to do that .
i do not think that this is the case .
mr president , on a point of order .
if the amendment is adopted , that will be done .
the answer is the same as before .
mr president , i should like to draw the attention of the house to a necessary addition .
that is what was agreed between the commission and the council .
does the rapporteur agree ?
very well .
on behalf of the members of the committee on budgets , i should like to make the following statement .
i will not go into political criteria .
we have already seen that this week .
applause
applause
it is not that we cannot reduce them but we cannot increase them .
let us consider the motion for a resolution .
it is my responsibility and i have decided . there will be no vote on this issue .
you were in favour .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
there has been enough time to establish that , and so i believe that we should vote today .
parliament agreed to this proposal
this is in yesterday 's minutes .
we are not having a debate now .
i could give you the floor on a point of order but not to make this kind of speech .
parliament adopted the legislative resolution
and that is precisely what has not yet been done .
we shall thus move on to the vote .
parliament adopted the decision
this is the aim of the draft regulations that we are discussing today .
i welcome this .
it will not help to improve economic and social cohesion .
and france .
i voted for the report .
i do not think that we have the opinion of the committee on the regions yet on these general provisions concerning the structural funds .
however , this debate is also an open one , as the european parliament elections take it to the level of all of the people of europe .
it is now up to them to have their say on the reform of european policies and integration .
this is why no amendments to the commission 's proposal were adopted in the committee on agriculture and rural development .
direct support for farmers is necessary , and it is essential for some sectors of agriculture .
we wish to see the final result before we reach a decision on the extent to which we can support it .
i share their view .
resolution on kosovo
mr president , i voted against .
! !
this is why i am pleased that the main points are once again being set out here .
applause
there are a number of general points i would like to make .
but how will this happen ?
mr president , i would give up my life for this house .
i do not mind .
the joint debate is closed .
applause
this was not to be .
on behalf of my group , i wish him all the very best for his future work .
applause
so what happened ?
the european commission must do what it can do well .
the joint debate is closed .
applause
many of the eu member states have an important role to play here .
'
what about them ?
applause
international criminal court
we should set an example here .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , when we talk today about justice and security , we can begin with an example close to home .
the joint debate is closed .
this is the first level of responsibility .
i think that is all that need be said .
the joint debate is closed .
that is quite a different matter !
these are the two community aspects that we in parliament must discuss .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will be taken in a moment .
that , at least , we were able to prevent , but we did not achieve our aim .
applause
thank you once again for all your work .
the debate is closed .
is it that in the council , the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing ?
make of it what you will !
commissioner , this research is very important for us in europe .
this is a real opportunity to find a new approach .
however , this is only the first step .
the debate is closed .
nevertheless , we need a community solution , which is why i call in my report for a draft directive or regulation to be put forward as soon as possible .
i would like to thank the committee on legal affairs for all its hard work .
i would just mention that four amendments were tabled in committee which were all positive and supported the line taken in the report .
applause
such legislation does not currently exist .
the debate is closed .
many thanks for all your work !
applause
we have included an amendment in the report to answer these concerns .
applause
this applies in the united states as well .
that is what is going on here .
let me give you an example .
this is why it is absolutely vital that these measures are taken now .
madam president , on a point of order .
they provide employment for more than four million people and they create more new jobs than any other sector of the european union 's economy .
only in this way will we be able to protect the development of the information society .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i should like to thank everyone , and above all to wish you well and hope that you will be back !
thank you very much .
applause
madam president , on a point of order .
madam president , on a point of order .
applause
'
he has not done so .
parliament approved the commission proposal
however , i have to tell the house that we have not yet received the opinion of the committee of the regions .
i shall therefore put this to the vote now .
madam president , on a point of order .
it is certainly better than it might have been .
this would create a new market for such products and would also be good for the environment .
the debate is closed .
parliament approved the commission proposal
i would like to thank all those responsible .
if we can look forward to a total budget of some eur 15 million , including the 2000 budget , then it is all thanks to the efforts of our colleagues .
applause
i would like to thank him once again for that report .
applause
applause
yet i believe in the end that the green group should support the idea of taking the project forward .
the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the resolution
nevertheless , some positive things have been achieved , above all as regards the commission 's approach to this sector .
it would then take appropriate action .
as regards the situation under the relevant international agreements , we have to keep in mind the following .
let me tell you one .
when sectors are in crisis , we must always ensure that we take the right measures in good time .
applause
the debate is closed .
parliament adopted the resolution
applause
applause
it is important to you and to me because of our own life experience . i believe that one only values what one does not have .
applause
applause
all human life is here .
applause
thank you .
mr president , i would just like to draw your attention to a small point which i think is rather important .
thank you very much .
applause
mr president , i too would like to thank you .
are there any comments ?
parliament has come to the end of its agenda .
the minutes were approved
ladies and gentlemen , we have reached the end of our work .
today , such thanks must be of a special nature .
applause
applause
applause
we should also like to thank them .
some of us have had to fight for this democracy .
mr president , i should like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to address the house .
we have seen it here today .
applause
applause
applause
everything is political . we will have five years in which to discuss political issues , but this is not the time .
applause
the vote was taken
i am not going to make a speech , as i shall be doing that tomorrow .
thank you very much , madam president .
i would also like to thank , if you do not mind , everyone who voted for me .
applause
the question of rules for members , for example , is a very important issue .
applause
applause
i want to wish you every success , on behalf of parliament , during your term of office .
we all wish you well .
applause
applause
the vote took place
address by the president
applause
applause
applause
applause
in this connection , i must tell you how i feel .
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
i thank the president-in-office of the council .
thank you very much .
applause
are there any comments ?
madam president , i would like to say something in relation to the minutes .
it seems to me that we should debate each issue in its turn .
applause
we are speaking here of the minutes .
we have taken note of this , but i do not believe that it was mentioned yesterday during the discussion .
i therefore think that the two things are different .
the next item on the agenda is a joint debate on
we could not and would not allow this to happen .
applause
the negotiations for accession have also made good progress over the last six months .
applause
we must make progress in five key areas .
applause
applause
this area of policy must be the european union 's next large project for integration , after the internal market and economic and monetary union .
applause
this is a new process .
this committee should present its report to the european council under the french presidency .
thank you for your attention .
we believe it has been a very good presidency .
applause
such action was necessary and just .
applause
this will promote stability and safety , democracy and peace .
applause
applause
there is no doubt of that .
applause
my third point concerns the reform of the eu institutions .
applause
applause
applause
this has been a difficult presidency .
but the most important progress has been in the area of citizens ' rights .
if we are to get this right , we need a new approach from the member states .
applause
applause
applause
i think some questions are in order here at the very least .
institutional progress ?
wrong !
we cannot talk in terms of success .
applause
my second question concerns the common security policy , particularly with regard to defence .
we are still not there .
i refer to the reform of institutions .
i will go further .
take note of what we do .
i now come to the fundamental aspects of the presidency .
the reality is that these decisions are taken under completely different conditions and in a completely different place .
applause
applause
applause
we must bring about confidence there and we must establish a free trade area there .
applause
applause
applause
we need structural reform in the european economic and monetary union , in the european union .
that is our aim .
we believe that we have a fair and just deal for member states .
applause
applause
i will now move on to the other main subject of my address today : the reform of the commission .
naturally , this is only the beginning and further , more important changes will follow .
first of all , let us consider the issue of health and food safety .
applause
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , this is the first time that a debate of this kind has taken place in this form .
that is progress and we welcome it .
applause
i consider it unacceptable .
applause
applause
applause
i would be pleased to hear you answer this question .
applause
applause
this must be done as soon as possible .
here we have to take the lead as members of the european union .
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
' this will be important to us .
applause
we will give it .
applause
applause
applause
applause
transparency , mr president , must not only be applied to management , including financial and administrative management , but also to political decisions .
applause
i would like to comment on these two issues .
there is an even more serious side to this !
my country 's government set up a programme of national assistance , as did others .
how much confidence can we show in you ?
at best , we can give you the benefit of the doubt .
applause
applause from the left
greater attention on the part of the commission to the fundamental rights of the citizens of europe will also be essential .
applause
this is why we , on the left , view your programme with confidence .
this is the direction in which we must move .
we expect a great deal from you .
applause
applause
firstly , the situation in kosovo .
you have mentioned some of them today .
secondly , the intergovernmental conference .
applause
i believe you will need it , but most of all europe will need it .
applause
applause
applause
applause
applause
firstly , however , a few words on developments in the union in general .
i completely agree with him .
the council , like the union as a whole , has to focus on the essential .
aid must go to where it is most needed .
applause
applause
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , i would like to welcome you here to the european parliament .
applause
enlargement of the union is essential for the stability of europe .
applause
we will have much more brussels and less democracy .
the commission also provided humanitarian aid throughout the conflict .
what has been provided so far in terms of aid ?
applause
applause
i do not believe it is .
applause
the union has to change direction .
applause
that is precisely why it is essential for our citizens to step up their fight against the objectives of the european union .
but at what price ?
this is what the authorities of the union and the governments of the member states should understand .
i make this point so that those who are new here today know that we have been talking about this for a very long time .
applause
you need it and we need it .
this is not democratic and we will fight it .
applause
it simply will not do .
applause
my country , germany , did not want him .
now he is in turkey .
i believe that the whole process of development , also in terms of society , is of great importance .
it could not be any other way .
the question is whether or not there is the basic political will throughout the whole of europe to ensure its progress .
that is what is important .
only in this way can we ensure the protection of our citizens .
mr president , today we have heard two foreign ministers speaking on the issue of turkey .
i would like an answer from the minister .
i shall see that you receive this proposal .
earlier this week , a request was made for attention to be given to the subject .
i think that you would receive a great deal of support from this parliament .
mr president , kosovo is a small economy .
that is no solution .
applause
in this way , i believe the success we are after will be achieved as soon as possible .
applause
it has been said that parliament should provide itself with the means for this action through its budgetary powers .
that is welcome .
it is important .
we have crucial decisions to make in the union and in the regulation of information technology over the next five years .
finally , of course , it will create jobs .
however , i would like to answer two questions .
the commission expressed the same position in the general affairs council .
i believe that we have to discuss the matter again with the new commission , and also with you here in the european parliament .
the debate is closed .
on the other hand , there is still a lot to be done .
this is also relevant here .
applause
there is more .
that was all i wanted to say .
i support absolutely the council 's decision to refer this matter to the court and to use all the powers that there are under the agreements .
applause
therefore , we shall meet up here once more at the end of the year .
thank you .
she said that it would be ' better if the commission had taken the step of reference to the court of justice ' .
but there is no lack of concern or consideration in the current commission , despite the fact that it is coming to the end of its life , in these issues .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
these are important issues and if it does not , then i think serious questions must be raised .
the minutes were approved
in order to be successful these efforts need , and should receive , the support , not just of the council , but the european parliament also .
now to the reason itself .
this project is about to draw to a conclusion .
the commission is trying to deal with this matter as quickly as possible but , in this regard , we also need the support of the member states and , above all , of this parliament .
i would now like to talk about some trade issues with third countries .
applause
only then will the council start to act .
applause
applause
that is a fair few .
applause
applause
so let 's get down to business .
everything the commission did , and the way in which it was done , was excellent .
he made reference to legislation which is necessary .
waste products have no part here .
we have to change this within the european union as well as with our partners outside the union .
applause
we must have european regulations .
my colleague said things of this kind can happen in any country .
but that is not all .
i am pleased about this , but still i cannot help but feel that this is still too little .
what we need here is both transparency and public access to information .
the question is how ?
what can be done ?
member states and the council must therefore both show greater transparency .
you are quite right in saying that we need new quality standards .
of course , it goes without saying that it is all about public health .
who will be able to do this ?
i think it is particularly important for this to happen in europe .
at the end of the day , that is what it is all about .
i very much doubt it .
what will be next on the list ?
we very much hope that the commission will be able to tell us .
however , such a view would be wrong .
so , in my opinion , we have to put our own house in order in this matter .
that has already been made clear here this morning .
i can see at least three .
i should like to draw attention to two matters : firstly , the side effects .
that is why i wish to make you fully aware of these two points in particular .
i do not want to know what will be next .
therefore , we all have a responsibility .
applause
i would like to return to two particular comments .
regarding this , i would like to state very clearly that food monitoring is the responsibility of the member states , of the regions and the local authorities .
a second issue which has been raised by many is the question of the use of community funds to aid farmers who have been victims of this crisis .
applause
what is the issue here ?
that cannot be the plan .
just so you know !
the debate is closed .
of course .
absolutely .
applause
madam president , have you , from your position of importance , had the time to take any action in this matter yet ?
applause
i have taken note of your request .
vote
madam president , whether amendments 1 and 4 are important or not , have we been made aware of them ?
that is a good question .
the amendments have not been given to any member .
applause
applause
as this resolution has not been adopted , we shall vote on the other resolutions .
do you agree ?
absolutely not . that would have been the case had their resolution been adopted , but it was not .
no amendment to the treaty was proposed .
however , we wish to draw attention to three points on which we do not share the group 's position .
these are :
kosovo
) kosovo !
' .
are there any comments ?
this is how we have done it in the past .
i would like to make that point .
there is a second point which i would also like to make .
i think that many here share your concern .
it is important that we find out the result of every vote .
i request that effective measures be taken .
applause
applause
that is on the agenda for this morning .
applause
the minutes were approved
the point is well made and well taken .
on the question before the house , i would like to make the following statement on behalf of the commission .
it is not taking it seriously now .
this is simply not acceptable at all .
it must do something to stop it .
i support the european union in developing its role to protect those citizens .
applause
and why is this an accepted practice , ladies and gentlemen ?
applause
applause
i am sure the whole house thanks her for her contribution .
come on .
this is the point .
thank you , mr commissioner .
but i can tell you , as you well know , that this is a matter of great concern to me .
and indeed , i have already expressed a very strong opinion on this matter on behalf of all of us .
are there any comments ?
i take note of your request .
this is the procedure .
there is no need to start a debate on the subject .
order of business
the next item is the order of business .
i have the document of this report in which it says that the committee voted it .
i would like to express my agreement on this point .
why is this ?
some , in my opinion , are necessary , very necessary , and can be carried out . others will need time .
and i would like to end by saying that this debate is good and positive .
we believe that much can be done .
it is a question of the responsibility of the commission to the european parliament .
this has to change , but we will discuss this together .
this is certainly not the case .
in this regard , clear decisions must be taken .
i would like to make one more comment in connection with this which is very important as far as my group is concerned .
this will be a difficult matter .
there are two general comments to be made .
we will certainly come back to this matter .
i believe that is quite right .
it is a policy that does not find favour with everyone .
i consider that to be an excellent proposal .
is that so ?
it will provide a basis for working towards serious reforms .
it is quite unacceptable .
however , since everyone is talking about the commission , i would like to talk instead about the european parliament .
that must change - and it will change .
now the next step must be taken .
we do want a strong commission but we also want a strong parliament .
to some extent , and others have made this point here , it is also something that we as a parliament must address ourselves .
but various things must first be done .
but the commission is a political democracy .
the talk must be of democracy .
how do you go about that ?
political reforms are needed , then , and not just administrative reforms .
little attention was given to management of the programmes .
that should certainly not be allowed to happen .
we would like to see that implemented . again , we will have further discussions on that in the committee .
a new financial regulation .
excellent .
it demands it , perhaps , because we have never had it .
we want a commission which is strong and independent .
therefore , we want you to be prepared to say no when you are asked to carry out work for which you do not have the resources .
perhaps this was pressure ?
this is not good for europe and not good for any of us .
i am very pleased to be able to say that i have no important questions to ask him in this connection .
that will benefit the european project , the success of which we all certainly believe in and wish for .
i think that this is quite a serious matter .
this is an administrative problem , not a criminal issue .
we would like to see that implemented .
again , we will have further discussions on that in the committee .
i hope you can answer some of them at least .
, commission .
we are in agreement about the objectives .
i hope that will be very clear .
it is no such thing .
i will not be able in the time available to answer all of them .
i hope that we will have parliament with us on that .
the changes i want in my view cannot come quickly enough .
they will work to the benefit of the whole of the union .
there is much more than i would like to say .
but thank you just now .
the other thing i want to refer to is the information system itself , which i think is very important .
it is an important problem but there are other issues .
in any case , why is she not here ?
but we want information from the european commission .
a clear plan in this regard must be implemented by the year 2000 .
in conclusion , i support the proposals in the report .
the debate is closed .
i want to make sure that this instrument is in fact a directive .
people want to see the legislation implemented .
a directive has legal force and we feel that is what is needed .
how can this best be achieved ?
parliament would like it to be a directive instead .
the other member states are against it .
the debate is closed .
however , we still have one problem .
i will now turn to the representatives of this group .
that would be quite in order .
that is all that i am saying , even if it is very important to get the minutes approved .
so , i turn to the house .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the time to vote for the commission has come .
together we must put europe at the service of the people .
i know you share my views on this .
we come from different countries .
a ' new european order ' .
but europe is not about institutions : it is about people .
we must now start to put them into practice .
this is now possible .
i hope that in your vote tomorrow you will give the new commission your strong support .
a new commission .
a new european parliament .
a new start .
( applause )
that is why we need a commission which is in a position to act .
we support a new culture of relations between the european parliament and the european commission .
( applause ) our group does not place party political interests above the interests of the european union .
( applause )
the first is the reform of the institutions .
this has not been the approach nor the view of my group .
many in my own group have raised this question with me .
again i return to that point today .
where everyone is responsible it can result in a system where no one is responsible .
it is high time that we had this new beginning .
it is the time for us to return to serious work .
no .
and we have received it .
but let us take a look at what he has done in the past .
where is the problem then ?
you have some experience in this respect .
secondly , reform of the institutions .
they were positive .
we will do all we can to create the conditions necessary for success .
however , we are doing all this as a means to implement european policies .
very well .
a new beginning of this kind is in fact necessary .
firstly , political responsibility must also be accepted by each individual .
we are a europe in the making .
we want to be a strong parliament and that is why we also want a strong commission .
but all in all , our wish for you is that you will be the strong commission we need , although it is possible that not all members of our group will vote for you .
but we want to go further .
i hope that this commission will achieve this .
we would then need a new political plan to deal with the economic and social issues .
however , this will lead to an increase not a reduction in the social crisis .
and this is the real question of the intergovernmental conference .
mr president , i should like to make four points .
it is not political .
it is a point of principle .
however , more is needed in order to achieve these things than you have so far set out .
so much for european democracy .
it is something that all the european institutions - the council , the commission and this parliament - must fight for together .
this is particularly true for agriculture .
in general , i take a positive view of your programme and of what you have put forward already and today .
there are , however , three things i should like to ask you to consider .
we did not get it right with the previous commission .
this is a step in the right direction .
however i would like to say a few words about fishing .
that is four or five in all now .
in your speech today , you did not say a word , not a single word , about environmental policy .
you mentioned sustainable development once .
you have shown in the past that you do not seriously mean what you say , and so you no longer say anything at all .
you have all had time to look at them .
are there any comments ?
i therefore think that the minutes should also include the first part of the statement you made to the house yesterday .
that will certainly be done .
are there any other comments on the minutes ?
our task is to vote in favour of the minutes or against them , certainly not for or against the consequences of this vote and of a statement by this house .
that is all .
are there any other comments ?
in your kind response , you said :
( the minutes were adopted )
everyone has said that this morning .
you will be responsible for the common interests of europe .
mr president , on a point of order .
thank you .
however , it did not quite happen in this way .
i should like to mention three .
that is an urgent priority .
should all go well tomorrow , we look forward to working with her on these and other matters .
either you draw up a draft regulation or the committee will do it itself , in which case there is already a text .
the start of a new commission 's work is a moment of hope for europe .
mr president , mr president of the commission , in your speech this morning you said that the commission was to become much more open .
i say this because our committee too was involved in this matter .
together we can work for the future of the european union .
is the crisis situation in the institutions to continue ?
so you will not find us voting against the resolution .
this government could have done its own country a better service .
we need stability and we need to get down to the business of policy as quickly as possible .
at the same time there is a need for an important balance between the commission , parliament and the rights of governments .
i hope you agree with that .
i wish you all well .
secondly , how can we be sure that we will get the information which we need ?
the number one priority must be the reform agenda .
this is the beginning of the reform process and we now look forward to some action .
that is something that i hope the commission will approach as a whole and not just , on a point of order , the equal opportunities of women .
there is still a lot to be done here in the services .
we must work together .
in this respect , for example , we must respect the commission 's right to initiative .
we also expect you to let us know how you think international standards can be developed .
what we now need is a common economic policy .
in europe we have three authorities concerned with this issue .
i speak from our experience on the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy .
i have asked the president to consider this matter .
enlargement is the main priority , but it is not without its problems , both for the countries concerned and for the union itself .
nevertheless , a few comments need to be made here .
but i believe that we must go further .
we want to see action soon .
you have said that you want the commission to be the government of europe .
i feel that we must discuss these issues further .
the same applies to the european commission and a european commissioner .
budget for 2000
i should like to wish you well for the future .
let us now get down to the budget .
if we had more cooperation with the member states we would not have as many problems .
that is one thing we cannot do .
the member states have to pay some time .
it will not go away .
that will be our position , i am sure .
this is a debate taking place between the council and parliament .
but this is not our role .
we do not feel that this is a good policy .
we consider this to be a serious matter .
but i want you to know that our dialogue will be difficult .
i support this idea fully .
thank you , minister .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
this is what i said yesterday and i stand by it .
we shall now return to the minutes , if you do not mind .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
the position of the presidency is that the new instruments now have to be made full use of .
and what , then , should it be based on ?
the aim is to offer a high level of protection , common to all countries as far as is possible , to those who need it .
there is experience of this in certain countries that we can draw on .
i know that it would take any amount of hard work , but i shall list those matters that are of most importance .
however , it is at least as important to consider how we may improve the situation with respect to human rights in the european union .
this is a matter for both the legal and the administrative authorities .
this would increase legal security .
i shall expect initiatives from the commission regarding the implementation of this aim , which should be achieved as quickly as possible .
the meeting will start with a speech by the president of the european parliament .
that is why it is so important for us to discuss this subject today here in parliament , too .
this is essential .
i see that as very positive .
there is certainly a need for this .
i believe , as i am sure we all do , that the list is a long one .
but how will legislation be implemented ?
and how is it involved ?
welcome
( applause )
the relevant proposal was put forward by the european commission two years ago , and was adopted by the european parliament last year .
may i ask you another question madam president-in-office of the council ?
give us here in the european parliament full control and the final say over legislation .
it is a matter of having the political will .
this is the only paragraph which can be supported .
let us move in this direction then .
there is no freedom without security , but there is no security without justice .
the union 's policy must draw on this principle .
experience so far is not so good .
however , ladies and gentlemen , at this summit we want something more specific , especially in the area of justice .
it cannot only be a summit on immigration nor , of course , only on security .
madam president-in-office of the council , there is a lack of specific proposals .
welcome
it is one example of the people 's agenda .
i believe that this is what our citizens expect .
with a common general system of values it can create for itself the thing that people first look at when they meet , a face .
i am therefore of the opinion that we should use today to bring this procedure back to parliament .
why should this be ?
it is certainly a question of european citizens ' rights .
one of the most important questions at the meeting will be the eu common immigration policy .
it was on this very issue that i based my own speech .
( parliament adopted the resolution ) ( applause )
i believe that these principles are essential for a strong commission .
let me turn to the content of your resolution .
this is not a commission report and you will receive it at the same time as i do .
let me add a further comment on this .
as president , i have to say that i need these rules in place on day one of the new commission .
i know that today 's vote does not concern only these aspects of our work together , but also what we must do together for europe .
unfortunately this was not the case .
( applause )
these are going to be difficult discussions and internal institutional reform is needed in the eu if the enlargement process is to be successful .
our group does have a group position .
we cannot accept this .
but when you come here to vote , you vote as you did !
look at your groups !
three groups said they did not have a common political position .
parliament must stop being like this !
( parliament adopted the decision ) president .
i do not actually think that he has ever been one .
as far as i am concerned , this is simply not acceptable .
i find that parliament has not made itself look any better in this matter .
however , i do not agree with voting against him .
what new employment policy ?
democratic procedure
the political content
these are the main reasons for a vote against the new commission .
nor is it a vote of confidence .
there are two aspects to these concerns : on the one side , the political side , of course we could not expect a green commission .
the majority of the commission is from the left .
. i will be voting for the new commission .
i can only say two things to him : one , that the task has been difficult and , two , that the result has been good .
i would not say very good , but i would say good .
i would also like to establish a connection with tomorrow 's debate , mr president .
we will come back to this point tomorrow .
i hope it does not happen again .
this was certainly unacceptable as far as we were concerned .
but soon , when the time comes to deal with budget 2000 , the same discussion will start up again .
i want to take the opportunity now to say that the green group will not support this .
we do not believe that to be fair .
kosovo is a special case .
i could not do this , of course .
the debate is closed .
i hope that we will continue to see him in his new role .
ladies and gentlemen , we cannot stand by and let this happen .
in future , we must turn our attention to these problems too .
now i wish to add three demands to the list already presented .
it was a long time before this decision was actually taken .
just because they wanted to be free .
and this is the time to act .
this has been said several times here .
it is clear what action must be taken .
it is a matter of respect for international law .
mr president , can i put this debate in context ?
however , we did .
and now , at long last , they have agreed .
but when will it go in ?
what had they done ?
nothing .
let us look at ourselves .
if only we could understand this once and for all .
it should not have .
but what form should this support take ?
this has actually happened now .
it is completely unacceptable .
it has to stop .
mr president , we were right to call for this urgent debate .
this is , of course , far too long .
we need strong action on the part of europe , the council , the commission and parliament .
that is my first comment .
what is wrong with us ?
let us deal with the situation as an international community .
i also believe that we in the european union must put our house in order .
i would like to add another consideration to this .
why ?
what is wrong ?
he is not here today .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
we are either in favour of human rights or , quite simply , we are against them .
should , in your opinion , two completely different issues be discussed together ?
the aim is to take the necessary decisions by the end of the year 2000 .
thank you for your answer .
is there to be a common defence policy or not ?
can we not get a clear answer to this extremely important question ?
at this stage , i should still not , however , be able to say that we can begin to talk about a common defence policy .
there are no legal requirements to the effect that member states need to take measures if anything like that should happen .
the commission is fully involved in this work .
thank you . that is a good answer .
it should , however , be possible to develop it further .
obviously , matters will be discussed within the european union but , in order that progress might be made , we shall also give all our support to the united nations .
thank you for your answer to the question .
should not it be in the open and will you do something about it ?
could the council presidency give me further information on this ?
on the basis of this act , ireland has the right to apply for a contribution by the community .
as i mentioned in my speech just now , the council has had no proposal from the commission in this area .
i would like to thank the president-in-office for his answer .
) mr president , it is true that the free movement of people is a central principle in european union policy , which , moreover , has been implemented .
) mr president , i agree with the honourable member entirely .
mr president , mr member of the council , i think it is not enough for the european union to be concerned .
) mr president , i am very much of the same opinion as the honourable member .
is this issue of any concern to us ?
question time is closed .
are there any comments ?
you have asked a question , as is your right , but you must understand that i am not really in a position to give you the answer you would like .
( the minutes were approved )
the next item on the agenda is the following joint debate :
and the commission 's statement on the situation in kosovo .
they are taking the matter in hand themselves .
there are no authorities there .
that cannot happen following a decision by the council alone .
" that is not going to happen today .
this is of real concern to us .
our last concern is for clear financial responsibility .
some of the points have already been mentioned by my colleague from the committee on budgets .
we have therefore also fully supported her amendments .
i should like to make four points .
this must not happen .
they are there all the time .
but what are these projects ?
i consider that to be one of this parliament 's important demands .
at the end of the day , they are , after all , going to have to do it themselves .
that too is a good thing .
just in kosovo ?
we have a great deal of past experience , commissioner .
i heard no mention of those issues throughout the whole debate .
that is the reality .
it is only a start , but a good start all the same .
the rapporteur is right .
it might be appropriate , in the right place , to consider this point .
it is thus a new time for both the commission and ourselves .
finally , i should like to thank parliament on behalf of the commission for its amendments .
as a new commission , we would like to take a short time to look at the situation and your amendments , in order to be as sure as we can be that we get things right .
i am certain that the council will wish to do the same .
what do we see ?
i think this would benefit democracy .
i am sure others share your view .
the debate is closed .
without a positive response to these problems , peace will always be at risk .
within the health programme , the majority will go towards the education programme .
i do not want to waste parliament 's time and i thank the president for giving me the opportunity to speak on this subject .
the european union , in its turn , should provide financial assistance here .
progress on this issue is now urgent .
i offer the floor first to the rapporteur .
i will not do it again .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i should like therefore to say what we are voting about .
that is an important political point .
before the vote on the draft legislative resolution :
the two are different - we need to know .
that is what we shall support .
president .
financial crisis in russia
the next item is the commission 's statement on the financial crisis in russia .
we should not speak of a financial crisis in russia , however .
mr president , this time we are discussing russia 's financial crisis .
we need to look at how to develop internal investment .
there is nothing new about it .
it has to implement proper economic reforms .
those are the areas we have to focus on .
thank you to the commissioner .
that is the only possibility .
nothing further need be said about the number of victims .
this dialogue could begin between the european union and turkey .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
recent developments there give cause for concern , indeed i might say a great deal of cause for concern .
russia has enough problems as it is .
there is clearly a lack of objective information on the political situation there , but there is also a lack of respect for human rights .
but there was no follow up action .
as we know , there is no one at the present time who is prepared to go there .
with that , the debate is closed .
human rights
the resolution goes into this as well .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this is the second time we have discussed kosovo today .
in fact almost nothing is being done at the moment .
we must find the best way of working out a solution .
and so it goes without saying that we support the joint draft resolution .
i very much welcome that .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the united nations security council still has to decide , of course , on the nature of such a force .
it will then be possible for the union to consider whether and how to give relevant support .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
your statement was not included in the minutes , but i am pleased to take note of it .
( the minutes were approved )
i hope they can hear you .
this was a request that had been made by a number of members .
this decision was therefore taken .
ladies and gentlemen , let us now open the debate .
when you move into a new home , there are always problems .
having said that , i should like to make one request .
madam president , it is the same point .
nevertheless those are things we can deal with .
we do not want to do that to ourselves or to you .
we are pleased to take note of your comment .
people like me .
i need assistance .
it was not on .
five times that has happened to me .
but not here .
but at least we will see what can be done .
i simply think we have a responsibility to the public to set a good example .
here i would like to take up what some members have already said .
now i know that this is not the moment to start talking about this and we all know what the treaty says .
so i think you are making some progress .
mr president , there are two specific questions that i want to ask .
" i support it completely .
i am pleased to see them .
we should keep to the principles .
secondly , i completely agree with those who say that the least we must do therefore , is lead by example .
thank you very much .
but i think many of my colleagues will agree with me on this .
i hope not but time will tell .
and last but not least , we like to talk about transparency here .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , firstly my thanks for the good things which have quite rightly been mentioned .
i would like to mention three points .
firstly , services .
now they come much later .
i request that this be put to an end .
these things are just unacceptable .
we have a time problem .
mr president , i should like to say one thank you and make four short points .
i hope they can get that right .
this is a health and safety at work issue .
i particularly wanted to speak too .
then , you could have said so far earlier .
perhaps we need to do it again .
1 .
" request to speak " system
several are out of order .
4 .
what do we do
statement by the president
are there any comments ?
i hope he will be able to work in the parliament .
( the minutes were adopted )
agenda
the next item is the order of business .
we need an urgent statement and debate .
i hope time can be made for this .
that is not the case .
i have no problem with that .
i could do it .
but i do not think that we should do that .
i believe for a quite different reason that we should not do that .
i would like to have a serious debate on the matter .
no , we cannot do this .
therefore , i shall simply put this request to the vote .
who is in favour of a resolution at the conclusion of the debate on food safety ?
president .
i have received no proposals for amendment .
madam president , i have a request for information about a matter of order .
that is why i voted for that motion .
thank you very much .
it will be here tomorrow .
are there any comments ?
are there any further comments ?
( the minutes were adopted )
decision on urgent procedure
the eu commission 's task force is already working in the area itself .
public health and food safety
the next item is the statement by the commission on public health and food safety .
these are just some aspects of the consumer policy we need to think about .
in a single market , all citizens have the right to equal protection .
our aim is a fundamental reform of food law and we will put forward all commission proposals for this before the end of 2000 .
( applause )
you have made it clear . we are talking about the safety of our citizens , about health and about consumer protection in the european union .
therefore , work together with us in this area .
we do not have any of this .
we in the european parliament will then have time in the year 2000 to work on this . that is our task .
we have established that they do not work .
the one is crucial to the other .
you need to change this .
that is what i want .
i want transparency at a high level .
you said that you had still not decided .
thank you for your attention .
this , in my opinion , is the price of community solidarity .
what level of quality do we want for our consumers ?
how can we guarantee this quality ?
it is our way of life , as you said , mr president .
having said that , the questions remain : when will this actually happen ?
it seems to me that what the citizens expect of parliament and the commission are initiatives .
what is more , a good number of european states have not taken any action .
but this has to happen quickly .
let me take our local farmers ' markets as just one example .
it is an either / or situation .
we need to know why and how it has been allowed to happen .
that is my first important point .
could we , at long last , be allowed to know what stage we have reached ?
i would certainly like to know who these countries are and why they are taking this line .
i hope you understand .
we are all aware that there are many of them .
president of the commission , i welcome your proposals .
mr president , mr president of the commission , the commission 's statement on food safety comes not a moment too soon .
my second point concerns the internal market .
nevertheless , the internal market is an established fact .
it is an either / or situation : either there is a public health problem or there is not .
has a system of cooperation been agreed ?
who in the commission is to have the final word ?
these are questions which i would be pleased to receive an answer to .
we would like to hear from you today about them .
our farmers certainly do not want this policy .
we need an entirely clear information policy in all member states .
the british farmers are in crisis at the moment .
some other countries cannot say the same .
the same safety standards are needed in both cases .
an excellent idea .
do you have an opinion on this ?
who can guarantee its safety ?
free trade . a europe of citizens .
europe must now , therefore , also guarantee food safety .
that is what the people at home are saying to us , and that is what we are concerning ourselves with in the field of consumer protection .
food must also have its value .
we must be prepared to pay more for it .
but responsibility for food safety comes first , and only then can confidence increase .
for us , there are three essential points . we need good , proper legislation , and we need it quickly .
we must be in agreement about this .
this , however , is our task : that we should put our house in order , as we already have done in a sense .
in the end , health is important to all of us , ladies and gentlemen .
that is just the first thing i want to say .
we speak a lot about consumer confidence , but i would like to say once again that consumer confidence is not an objective in itself .
greater transparency for consumers is absolutely essential .
i have said so .
the debate is closed .
we must all work together in this effort .
what can we do to help ?
there are drugs for this and they must be made available .
i was pleased to hear the commissioner say that additional resources are to be made available again .
that is a good thing .
but i hope that this will also be taken account of in the budget as soon as possible .
do more and do it better .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , in fact the problem cannot be taken seriously enough .
here too , specific measures of support are absolutely necessary .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his statement .
too high .
clearly , the response should be political , which it was not .
here the international community can do a lot .
our aid budget is considerable .
i have four specific questions to ask the new commissioner .
in few areas , i believe , are coordination and cooperation more necessary than here .
mr president , my thanks to the commissioner for his statement .
let me first of all thank everyone for this debate .
i have a number of more specific comments to make .
the budget problem has been referred to by almost everyone in the debate .
those are my comments .
thank you again for this debate .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
what are they about ?
in the end , how much would it cost us to look on and do nothing ?
is that what we mean by stability ?
however , we do not believe that this point should be included in the text of the decision .
we believe that this type of control will be sufficient .
we are not here to discuss whether or not we should support the basic needs of the population .
with regard to amendment no 3 , however , i would like to make an additional point .
however , we are in total agreement with amendment no 5 .
firstly 1999 and then 2000 .
the joint debate is closed .
the security of the eu must also be considered .
it is not acceptable .
the problem is one of resources .
it is of course the european commission 's task to work towards this .
perhaps we need a little more time .
this is perhaps where most progress has been made , in europe and in this field , in recent years .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it is very welcome and important .
as you know , parliament agreed this at first reading .
i should just like to add two technical points .
i hope that will be acceptable to everyone .
but then again , one should not expect much of this programme .
we believe that only a framework should be created at european union level .
this programme is not enough on its own either .
legislative action and proposals may be brought into play , but it is not in itself a legislative programme .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this , i feel , will be the aspect of the agreements which will cause most concern .
i would particularly like to stress , in this regard , that with this free trade agreement the european union has included the agricultural sector in an agreement for the first time .
after all , economic development is essential if there is to be political stability and peace throughout the region .
i welcome this initiative .
this is certainly not the case the other way around .
it was not the commission and it certainly was not parliament .
the political aspects of the agreements are , of course , just as important .
this would benefit political stability and is what is most needed .
but we do not think the same can be said on a trade level .
mr president , like most of my colleagues here , i too welcome the fact that this agreement has come about .
but we must not allow it all to end here .
and obviously , i fully share its positive conclusions .
the debate is closed .
communication from the president of the commission
the next item is the president of the commission 's statement on the decisions taken by the commission at its meeting today .
or is there a risk of the council not making it public ?
how do you view this ?
in terms of power alone , no i do not have this power .
so we have made these ten changes which are , however , of fundamental importance .
madam president , i am being made aware of this problem for the first time .
we are dealing with a very serious and very important question of procedure .
he said that this would be high on his agenda and that the need was for structural change in european industry .
i would like to stress , however , a very important point - why have we done this ?
this is what i wanted .
question time ( commission )
first part
we expect europe to come up with a better answer than this .
you can see this from the fact that no such group had ever been set up before for any other country .
commissioner , thank you for this very clear answer . i am pleased to see you here for the first time in your new role .
commissioner , i would like to ask a question on the economic situation .
i believe this is a very important contribution that europe can make .
we shall do that through the programme .
thank you for that answer to my question .
this is a humanitarian issue , so it concerns you too .
the money i have mentioned is money we have in fact used .
i cannot use it again , and that was the point at issue in the question .
second part
that is the first question .
that is not the situation here .
both are important , but health is a key issue .
as you say , both issues are important .
as you can see , mr president , the commission has taken the initiative in this matter .
thank you for that answer , commissioner .
so , i take what you say extremely seriously .
thank you , commissioner .
let us move on to the specific issue here .
i have already discussed this with colleagues who are dealing with these matters in parliament .
i shall be making a case for this too , but i do not think that it is a matter of priority .
thank you very much , commissioner .
if not there should certainly be a solution to that .
thank you very much for your answer , commissioner .
it is much more important than that .
i accept what the member said .
this is particularly true in development aid where the available resources are never enough .
there has therefore not been any scope for community action in this field .
a number of specific projects are currently under way .
more projects are currently under consideration in the council .
i thank the commissioner for his response .
. absolutely !
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together .
we are discussing that with the world bank .
do you not have any information of your own ?
as far as i am concerned there are only questions which i am called upon to answer .
state of relations between turkey and the eu
the next item is the statement by the council and the commission on the state of relations between turkey and the european union .
it is clear that the union and turkey need one another .
two proposals for a regulation relating to financial cooperation in respect of the european strategy are at present on the agenda in the european parliament .
the commission would like to encourage the european parliament as soon as possible to issue its position on the draft regulations , with which the european strategy should be supported .
the european parliament clearly has a key role in this process .
but we should look to the future .
we do not think it right , to say this at this time .
secondly , what do the human rights organisations say ?
he is right .
" nothing further need be said !
have we not already done this ?
i myself do not wish to comment on this . it is not an area on which i would like us to comment .
i believe that we all , or at least most of us , agree on certain basic issues .
that is why i cannot support my own group 's amendment 1 .
so well done !
how can we do this ?
we cannot put this off any longer .
what are we prepared to do in order to achieve this ?
i would like the commission to give a clear answer as to what the terms of their proposal will be .
the first one is that relations between the european union and turkey are vital to both parties , now and in the future , in all areas and at all levels .
but to add other criteria would certainly not be european in the best sense of the word .
if only that were true .
we adopted a very clear position at that time .
we must support the cause of these people .
is this possible when it does not respect international law ?
it is up to them to change .
these are key issues .
mr president , the turkey of today is not the accession candidate of tomorrow .
in this sense , we can support everything that has been mentioned many times today .
we must make one thing clear for ourselves , however .
that is the reality !
we call it economic and social cohesion .
it is not we but our children who will have to pay the price .
now we have this opportunity .
turkey is already part of the process of enlargement of the european union .
this is indeed part of the enlargement process .
if i am asked whether we will ever live to see turkey as a member of the european union , i say i do not know .
if i am asked , whether we will get to the stage of negotiations with turkey concerning accession , i again say i do not know .
only when these changes have taken place , only then will it be possible to discuss negotiations .
a last word on the cultural aspect .
the debate is closed .
today , the situation is to a large extent different .
the european union has made an important contribution to developments in recent months .
i believe it is your first major statement to parliament on behalf of the commission .
welcome , commissioner .
they themselves have the key to this solution .
well , the un resolution must be implemented .
the european union has a large part to play here .
there have been key developments taking place in this regard , which have been mentioned by others .
mr president , commissioner , mr president-in-office of the council , i welcome the fact that , according to your statement , there is again movement in the peace process .
there is , however , a very great deal which remains to be done .
perhaps the commissioner and the council president will tell us how it may find the means to do that .
there is more work to do .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place during voting time .
it is not the case in every single country , but i think this proposal would be one solution .
procedures without report :
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
amendment no 5 is fully acceptable .
relating to amendment 5
we do not think that there are any problems with it .
that is quite clear then .
in fact , the vote is under way .
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( the parliament adopted the resolution )
madam president , i have to comment on the same thing .
i think it is very important .
it is important that every member should be clear as to what they are voting on .
i shall come back to this later .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
joint motion for resolution
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it is for these reasons that it seems important to me to draw the attention of this house to this essential aspect .
it is necessary , but it is not sufficient .
turkey
today turkey , and tomorrow perhaps another country too ?
the question must be asked .
how large should the european union become ?
i see things the other way around .
not so .
that is something we all have a need for .
so can we not have cooperation which is made to measure ?
we believe that a democratic turkey must be able to speak out about this itself .
but we also feel that the european countries themselves , that the people must know how far they want integration to go .
in which case , why can we not say this in our resolution ?
i have always had confidence in this .
in other words , nothing is agreed until everything is agreed .
however , this will not prevent results being achieved more quickly in some areas than others .
these would be questions of the environment , investment and competition , for example .
sustainable development is the common objective of the member countries mentioned in the wto agreement .
it is important for the union to guarantee the future work of the wto in the areas of trade and competition .
they can have an impact on the progress that we hope for .
welcome
i think you are right .
in the commission 's view , it is positive , for at least three reasons .
if i have referred several times already to developing countries , it is for two reasons .
thank you very much , commissioner .
for that reason i would like to ask the council two specific questions .
so much for internal policies .
what about nature ?
what about solidarity ?
let us not allow this to happen again .
look around .
this is the only way to ensure that these demands reach the union 's representatives .
as regards the content , there will clearly be a lot of questions .
finally , a wish and , in any case , a will .
) by our group .
) .
mr president , i had almost decided against speaking in this debate .
why ?
i think there are two things which will achieve this .
it is not just about trade , it is about international and social justice , it is about environmental concerns .
that matters to the public too .
we have to do it .
finally , i am pleased to hear the commission and the council mention the needs of the developing world .
mr president , commissioner , in the short time i have left , i would just like to make a few key points .
what do we need to do in terms of form ?
so what then do we really need ?
what are the most important areas that we really have to deal with ?
i shall now mention three of these aspects .
i expect greater commitment on the part of the council on this matter .
secondly , i would like to mention one of the most important points in future negotiations : the question of services .
not all services can be put on the same level .
but there is also a need for transparency in this area .
a contribution that has due respect both for trade interests and the interests of citizens .
the most important thing we need to do is to establish international rules for competition .
the role of parliament has also been discussed here .
the debate is closed .
obviously , these have a direct effect on people 's health .
this means that new policy action is needed .
it is important to bring technology , for example , to the less developed nations .
the european parliament has already had an important role to play in taking this work forward .
i also welcome the resolution which has been presented here today .
a number of sectors and interests must be involved in this work .
a programme of this kind may form the basis for further measures .
many people say that this will take time .
that is quite true , but it is also a good reason for taking measures right now .
we can see positive developments in certain areas .
it is going to cost them money .
we must therefore make more and more use of economic instruments of control .
we take this up in our resolution .
the best thing , however , would be for all countries to do this at the same time . the next best thing would be for all eu member states to do it at the same time .
what initiatives do you have under way ?
if these things are not done , it simply will not work !
they must both be seen as part of the greater whole .
in the end , however , it will be a question of the values of life and policy .
unfortunately , i have heard you say very little about these things here today .
there are two other points i would like to mention .
i ask her with my amendment to do one thing more .
they are right .
that is what i want .
this will not be achieved though , by means of a tax .
this is not the case , as this is an issue which concerns us all .
mr president , most of what needs saying has been said at this point .
i would just like to mention my concerns about my own country .
that is a major cause for concern . we should turn our attention to it .
as you know , the council cannot take a decision on this , so i cannot say anything at all on behalf of the council .
we shall present a report before the end of the year .
in this connection , too , i am in favour of the use of financial instruments of control because we know that they are effective .
it is something which we have to discuss in the commission .
i think that we are agreed that we should all do something to protect the environment .
this is necessary because there is no such plan at the present time .
i wish i could say that results will be seen no later than tomorrow , but it is going to take a little longer than that .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
we shall look at the questions put to the council .
this does not happen in other countries .
when we talk of regions , i understand that to mean that it is european regions that are being discussed .
thank you for your answer .
the council cannot yet therefore take up a position on this question .
this is a task for the council too , i believe .
however , it will then also have to be seen what resources are available .
thank you very much .
the talking has to stop .
thank you for your answer . i should like to ask an additional question .
i have two additional questions .
mr president , we most certainly like to receive information .
mr president , unfortunately , i have to say that i cannot really answer these questions .
this is a parliamentary question time .
my question is : do you not want to take this step at last ?
mr president , i wish to say that the same criteria apply to all countries .
it is called the culture 2000 programme .
thank you for your answer .
i wish to thank the president-in-office of the council for his reply .
i would like to know what the council 's response to this is .
i should like to thank the minister for his answer .
i know how difficult this area has been in the past for the council .
for this reason , it is the opinion of the council that a new approach should be found to deal with this issue .
i want to thank the council of ministers for this answer .
what was the second question ?
as far as i know , all the other countries have approved this .
this has nothing to do with the government that is currently in power .
that is the only solution .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , once more we have a war .
this is what we should avoid this time .
we must put a stop to this .
for this reason , it is good that we are today dealing with this matter in an urgent procedure .
the joint debate is closed .
this is a very good example of transparency .
this really is progress , when we can act together on this issue , and when what individual countries are doing is less important .
the joint debate is closed .
human rights
why am i saying this , mr president ?
the council must not stop .
it is urgent .
of course , the economic crisis has a role to play here , too .
what needs to happen ?
in that case , mr president , there is a need for help .
after all , that is what the kosovo conflict was all about .
these people are well aware that they do not always have control of the situation .
thank you very much .
the joint debate is closed .
so what happened ?
why was all this done ?
transparency is therefore an issue .
it is for the member states to take the necessary measures .
the joint debate is closed .
workers in the industry expect this , and the public most certainly does .
that costs money but it has to be done .
the nuclear industry is clearly out of control .
that , of course , is our position .
that is the purpose of our resolution today .
mr president , i would like to put some questions to the commission .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place in a moment .
mr president , i have a point of order to make .
agenda
this is the request which you should be speaking in favour of , first of all , on behalf of your group , and i shall therefore give you the floor .
at this stage there is no need for parliament to have a resolution .
( applause from the left )
we shall see when this can be done .
we all know them very well .
for precisely this reason , this house must also vote in favour .
i therefore think it is absolutely essential that we take this step here today .
this seems to us an excellent agreement .
in any case the members of the european parliament are subject to specific rules under the treaty itself .
our citizens will then ensure that they are done away with .
this information must , in the future , be provided as quickly as possible .
there are two different aspects to this .
the debate is closed .
of course , this will also have a central role to play when it comes to the wto negotiations .
there were not many of us present here then , but there are a few more of us today .
i wish him every success in his work .
i am very pleased by this development .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for this report .
that , after all , is what we want to achieve with the legislation that comes here .
this is very important , as has been said so many times today .
in that context the european parliament is not mentioned .
thank you for your cooperation .
the debate is closed .
that is the first objective .
that is the second point .
i am sure that will have the full support of the house .
for a new member he has done very well on this .
why is that ?
i congratulate him on that .
i do not know why .
we fully agree that this is a serious problem from both safety and environmental points of view and the commission can accept the two amendments .
the debate is closed .
this is why i think it is particularly necessary to do something about this specific area .
it seems to me that this directive is too important for that .
this is something we really need to ask the commission to consider .
we also need to consider our own approach .
the debate is closed .
we have to be concerned about safety .
it goes without saying , as has been said here , that these are very important issues .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this is the situation we find ourselves in .
i think this is a serious point .
parliament says no .
it is not acceptable .
it is just not possible .
this is the situation as we see it .
it would be a serious matter .
what is parliament 's response ?
just now , i left out one essential point , research , within the framework of administrative reform .
this is a demand which parliament is making and i would like to see it taken fully into account by the commission and by the council .
( applause )
as i mentioned earlier , kosovo has become the main priority of the budgetary procedure for 2000 .
i would like to thank the president and the members of parliament .
there are two other areas that the foreign affairs committee would like to draw your attention to .
that has not been done .
mr president , this instrument is something we have already proposed .
the committee on budgets has let down the european court of justice , as has the council !
it is all too clear who is responsible for this .
we hope he will soon be back with us .
mr president , i would like to thank my colleagues on the budget committee and the budget rapporteur in particular for the good cooperation we have had with them in this first reading .
others have referred to the structural funds .
one that is important to the employment committee is that of social dialogue .
this , we think , is a very important area - the idea of developing civil dialogue .
employment , of course , is one of the most important issues from the point of view of the employment committee .
mr president , firstly i congratulate the rapporteur of the committee on budgets on the work he has done this year .
they have to give greater priority to the interests and needs of citizens .
in 1999 alone , the member states applied for more money than was available in the eu budgets .
finally , i would like to point out that the common fisheries policy - but i do not really need to tell you that - requires major support by the community .
i do not just mean financial support .
i will deal with the regional policy priorities first .
they do it because they believe in europe and they want to make the single market work .
mr president , the budget debate is always a key moment to express one 's political will .
i believe that here also the council must compromise with parliament .
i believe that we can have good dialogue here .
we have done this in the past and will do it in the future .
i would like to see that .
that is not the case .
we need to discuss this .
in future , we cannot just promote the production of individual products , but the development of rural areas .
we must know what concerns the public sector and what concerns the private sector .
it simply cannot be done .
we must pay this money .
i am very pleased that the rapporteur still put this right in his report .
i think that is precisely our point .
where is it all going to end ?
next a few words about the structural funds .
i thank the rapporteur very much .
so , i congratulate the rapporteur .
this is in the particular context of the commission .
we cannot expect others to take on that particular responsibility for us .
i therefore welcome the idea of a working committee between the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on budgets .
what are the real needs of the commission ?
it is now up to the commission to bring forward a proposal on how we might implement the proposal for a european political party .
i hope we will support the rapporteur 's proposal here .
the next few years will demand a lot from us .
we are also responsible for this .
in this regard , we have already heard several key points today .
it cannot just be about the eu .
funds must also be made available for this .
but in all these areas we need more transparency .
a lot has been said about kosovo .
well , that is all very well .
mr president , this budget is fundamental to the development of europe in the next few years .
we need both things .
the priorities are clear .
well done commissioner !
we have shown that we are prepared to do that .
can i say to both the presidency and the commission that this is something we need to find a solution to together and quickly .
i hope the council can do the same .
i am in favour of aid for kosovo .
it is not a matter for the budgetary authority , but something they can do , and indeed are doing , by their own efforts .
what is the situation ?
what then , in my opinion , are the main criteria for this budget ?
he has developed a strategy that everyone can support .
that is my first point .
i have one more small point to make about kosovo .
of course we can consider the situation in terms of existing needs .
i am completely in agreement with taking this approach .
i would particularly ask the rapporteur to take this into account and to support the position of the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities .
mr president , this is my first budget .
increased transparency will be the key to the future success of all eu institutions .
i welcome this .
what matters to them is the impact and the positive benefit of policies , such as this one .
taking away from some in order to meet others is not acceptable !
in addition , programmes such as best are of crucial importance to us .
there are only a few more years to go .
i wish to refer , firstly , to market measures in the agricultural sector .
i would like to mention the issue of research .
, rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
it has to be said , a lot happened in the course of this year .
this should continue to be the case .
it is no longer possible for monetary policy just to be responsible for price stability .
what is the nature of this problem ?
i am of the opinion that the european central bank must make a contribution to economic growth and employment by means of its monetary policy .
and what sense is there in parliament giving an opinion of one single act of the central bank ?
why is the debate we are having today so important ?
why not ?
why ?
there is no basis for this .
is this success ?
some may question why i , as a british member , should like to speak on this issue .
very well .
there will be no structural reform without growth .
mr president , this is an important debate for it is the first time we have come to discuss the european central bank 's report .
why should not the european central bank be able to do the same ?
in this case , it is the responsibility - i would say the main responsibility in this area - of the commission .
i hope there will still be enough time for this .
i hope that he will take a little time to address this issue before we close .
but i want a clear answer today .
first of all the issue of transparency .
what does transparency mean ?
i ask parliament to take that into account .
that is our strategy .
we all want to go forward .
then it would be possible .
our task is to promote financial stability and the stability of the financial markets .
we are fully involved in the further development of rules .
the debate is closed .
this should be done within the framework of the existing regulations .
secondly , there is the question of our management strategy .
and , finally , the conclusions .
and , if that is the case , in what respect ?
we will come back to that .
for the time being we will work on the basis of the existing regulation .
i should very much like to see open debate and open procedure .
no , to the first part of the question .
the debate is closed .
it is not a military plan .
in order to live in peace we need a national agreement supported by the international community .
thank you very much .
this is vital to ensure that the enlargement process has a positive impact on european stability .
but the union must also reform .
i discussed this with the president this morning .
the decisions are , however , just words on paper .
and this is especially important in relation to two issues .
the first is asylum .
the second is immigration .
this is positive .
this must now change quickly .
on individual rights , some progress was made but not enough .
this is now urgent .
we will only be able to find out more from the legislative proposals that will be put forward .
and what about freedom ?
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , i should like , on behalf of my group , to ask and answer three questions .
the second question is this : was this summit a success ?
cooperation with parliament also means cooperation in the relevant committee .
this is part of the european union 's project and of the development of the union , and it goes much further than is necessary .
i believe we should achieve this in time .
this is a really effective way of making progress .
it is an important step .
we need more light !
yet the situation is urgent .
so far , the council has left this matter up in the air .
i should like to address a second issue .
the people of europe expect more .
the citizens of europe can certainly demand that the law in every individual member state should offer them the same level of safety , protection and security .
the council and the governments alone cannot create these .
parliament must help them .
now i would like to speak on certain other matters that have been raised here .
thank you very much mr president-in-office of the council .
the debate is closed .
the first objective has been achieved .
i shall return to this point in a moment .
we do not think so .
change is necessary for the court .
our citizens must be involved in the debate about the content and objectives of the reform .
and what did we find ?
a word about the reform of the institutions .
the intergovernmental conference is one very good opportunity for doing just that .
mr president , what must the next intergovernmental conference do ?
what must it do ?
what must it mean ?
the treaty of amsterdam did this already .
how far is europe going to go ?
how far do we want to go ?
the debate is closed .
mr president , on a point of order .
thank you , let us now move on to the vote .
so what next ?
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
procedure without debate :
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
procedure without report :
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
does the commission wish to comment ?
mr president , we have no problem with any of the amendments .
thank you .
president .
would the commissioner like to comment ?
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
this was extremely important to me .
these are matters which are unacceptable .
so , a comment will be made .
the demands we make of the council and the commission we must also be prepared to ask of ourselves .
this means that regulations to control this new market must be adopted as quickly as possible .
at the time of the first reading , the european parliament proposed several amendments .
we were pleased to note that many of them were adopted in the common position .
this must also apply to the amendments proposed today .
it would be to the european union 's benefit to establish an international organisation .
the development of cooperation must not , however , lead to an increase in regulation .
my next point concerns social dialogue .
i believe that today is the first time she has been involved in a debate on social affairs .
i think that it is a good thing in itself that we should discuss this subject again in this new parliament .
of course jobs are often created as well but much less is said about that .
the commissioner said the same .
i have not heard government assistance mentioned .
might the commissioner be prepared to say something more on this issue ?
that is what europe needs .
that will be good for europe and will guarantee jobs in the long term .
but what can we do ?
then there is the responsibility of the european union .
you will understand this .
today , we should tell it like it is .
that would be a contribution to social peace , and the share markets would then have every good reason to see an increase in value .
it is still often the case , though , that not enough information is provided soon enough .
mr president , commissioner , by this stage of the debate many things have been said .
but the best way to promote job security is for companies to be successful .
that is very much a fact of life .
rather it is for us and indeed for governments to see what we can do to help , as far as is possible , avoid the problem in the first place .
we are not concerned here with a law of nature .
however , that is not enough .
what we need as a priority here is a development initiative .
it was said that europe will have to create an environment for our companies .
and we , the european parliament and the commission , form part of the political powers of europe .
the debate is closed .
i also believe that all honourable members have a particular role to play in this respect .
it is what we all want .
now all of these things are certainly in doubt .
i should like to make three points in this debate .
they do not have it now .
it seems that much more important to me at this time for the eu to take the initiative in this area .
that was not enough .
we know that .
therefore , we must do a lot more .
it is in our interest , it is in their interest and it is in the whole world 's interest .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .
he said foreign trade was having a positive impact on the economy .
after this there was a short debate on the eu 's common foreign and security policy .
but there is unfortunately less progress in the other direction .
how in the circumstances could it have been ?
military might is necessary , but it should be used only to keep terrorism under control .
it is certainly only right that that too should be the case .
in fact , that really cannot be all there is to say .
aid organisations cannot work there .
naturally , we need russia , for example in kosovo . but russia in turn needs us , that is to say it needs the european union .
( applause )
why not ?
who do you then have a political dialogue with ?
the debate is closed .
culture 2000 programme
i believe it is the same in every country .
i hope that the quality of the projects which we are now to have will make up for the lack of financial resources .
mr president , i just wanted to make a few general points in connection with cultural matters .
mr president , i think that the european citizens are currently in great need of this .
the debate is closed .
mr president , first of all i should like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
on a final note , the programme must be set up soon .
i congratulate the rapporteur .
this is an important step forward .
it is not very much , but it certainly is positive .
mr president , a short comment .
i am therefore able to accept almost all of the amendments .
young people are our present .
the debate is closed .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i am new to this parliament .
and yet it is they which would find using this service of great importance .
the question is what do the members who are not here think ?
this requires objectives and efforts .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report .
the debate is closed .
i think that this is a very significant decision .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( applause from the left )
i am quite sure of this .
this seems to be the best way forward to me .
madam president , i wish to make a comment about this resolution .
very well .
that is quite clear .
we understand your point .
so , things should be quite clear .
( the minutes were adopted )
my question , madam president , has to do with the procedure .
we must be clear on this point .
absolutely .
if you do not want us to support you , let us know and next time we will not do it .
thank you . i hope that the services responsible for the minutes will be able to make the necessary changes .
thank you .
i see that he will .
madam president , may i ask how it is that there is a change to the voting order ?
that is because it is still the amendment of the committee on budgets which we are going to vote on .
we already have a problem .
i can understand people voting against it .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we must come back to these matters again .
and parliament was in agreement .
here there is a political will to create a conflict with the council and not to respect our word .
therefore , may i say that as far as we are concerned , it makes no sense to refer the report to the committee .
mr president , this is a very serious situation .
we did not actually need the reference in the rules of procedure .
let us not put ourselves in that position !
ladies and gentlemen , as you can see , this is quite a difficult situation .
this resolution did not achieve the necessary majority .
however , we made another agreement as well .
mr president , i shall speak with right on my side .
for that is precisely what you have achieved !
i therefore think that we must look at this subject again in the future , and i too hope that we will be able to do this very soon .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i would like to make two proposals .
as far as the point under discussion is concerned , i have the following proposal to make .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
for these reasons , we shall once again be voting against the draft budget .
they supported this in committee .
thank you .
once more , the european parliament should review its directive on this point .
it is an unacceptable resolution and , on behalf of all working people , we shall be voting against it .
this is the reason why i cannot welcome this commission proposal .
there is no doubt about it .
it is accepted that we should establish a common european transport policy .
instead , all one is trying to understand here is what is necessary in order to provide safety .
this is an area where europe must make a positive contribution .
i would like , however , to make some comments about what has been said in the debate .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
when ?
how ?
what kind of agreement , commissioner ?
what kind of cooperation ?
that is the date that was set .
but i would like to tell you , commissioner , that we are not going to take that into account .
our problems with the resolution are not just on this point - although it is a very serious issue .
there are specific criteria that we would like to follow .
this is not acceptable .
we must respect their rights .
this is not only an economic problem .
but now that we have reached this situation , we should work out why it is that we have done so .
mr president , my political group has tabled its own resolution and amendments to the resolution of the other political groups .
what does this mean ?
this time the same thing will happen .
mr president , commissioner , firstly let us address the situation in hand .
we should not use this debate to look after our own national political interests .
it is a community debate .
fishing policy is a community policy .
i do not believe that we should tell the commission what it should or should not do .
in fact , we do not know if an agreement will be reached .
but the funds are already available .
all european problems are the problems of all eu states , and i therefore wish to say that this fisheries agreement is a problem for europe as a whole .
it concerns the european union as a whole .
it is a matter which i think can be seen from two points of view .
we can only be successful in this matter if all three institutions work together .
( applause )
the european union needs to address this issue .
the sitting is closed .
are there any comments ?
i shall give you an answer .
we never go back on a vote .
in my opinion , this is not right .
you did not know this and now you have been made aware of it .
madam president , you have quite rightly said that we should never have to vote a second time , yet this is precisely what we did yesterday .
madam president , it is not a point about the minutes but about the problem that was mentioned in the minutes .
( the minutes were approved )
i take note of his words .
this meeting is still going on .
this is unacceptable .
but i say to the commission that the responsibility being shown by the national farmers ' union can only last for so long .
i hope there will be a solution quickly .
it is not doing any good to any of our farmers , whether they be french or british .
no cases at all .
i hope france will see sense .
commissioner , i have two further points to put to the commission .
france , moreover is not the only country to adopt this position .
if we do this , mr president , commissioner , some good will have come out of this crisis .
but this is not the same thing .
i am sure you understand why there is still some doubt .
would they ?
mr president , commissioner , it is crucial for all of us that we can guarantee the safety and quality of our food .
just think of the future , when we are discussing eu enlargement .
these are basic principles .
we can do it by ourselves , and only by ourselves , and we must do so as quickly as possible .
i will give you one such example .
and for why ?
that would include some things which are not yet present in other european countries .
that does not happen in some other countries .
the solution is a national one .
the debate is closed .
for this reason , we are not in a position to talk about a new fisheries agreement .
we are in total agreement with this solution .
it is about time that we in this house said that we have had enough of it all .
we should therefore use this time .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
statement by the president
are there any comments ?
you were quite right to do so .
( the minutes were approved )
agenda
the next item is the agenda .
this is for various reasons .
fair enough , i had to accept that .
that is of great importance to my committee and will be of importance to this parliament in the months to come .
we are working on that very point in my service at the moment .
that remains my view .
we have not reached that stage yet but it is the hope that we will .
this can be done within a matter of days .
like you , i am also concerned as to the protection of consumers .
i welcome her statement in that regard .
there was no vote taken by that committee .
i regard this as a good way forward .
how independent are they ?
i welcome the opportunity , in response to your question , to do so again .
it may all happen earlier .
if it does , so much the better .
madam president .
i am not sure that we want at this stage to move quite that far .
how many more days do we need to have a decision ?
is the scientific committee and the commission going to look at that ?
sometimes it is difficult to achieve both of those at the same time .
that is what i am trying to do .
that is what i am trying to achieve .
and why was that ?
this item on the agenda is now closed .
it is thus a new process .
the time will be used for discussions .
these discussions have concerned matters of principle regarding social and economic development .
we need both .
we just have to find the right content and form for the dialogue at european level .
it is for this reason that all 15 member states are not present , only the representatives of the council .
i want to speak about three areas : context , dialogue and democracy .
efforts are , of course , required to reduce the unemployment levels which are still far too high .
the states ?
the commission ?
the european union ?
the european central bank ?
then there are the social partners .
just one more point .
quite simply , not enough is being done by the individual member states .
but it is important that , in future , we should in fact be so .
i shall stop now .
we need political guidelines .
all we need now is the implementation measures .
this will provide the basis for coordination across the european union .
what kind of dialogue is this ?
there is a strong wish in parliament to bring this about .
we need to look at the reform of labour markets .
all those things impact upon the social partners .
we see this as a first step .
it does not present itself , however , as some fundamental reduction in unemployment .
the coordination of our economic policy is not on that level at the moment .
should it include the issue of the environment ?
you already know the situation , thanks to the decisions of the european council .
having said that , what can we do and what are we doing ?
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
nothing has been tabled so far .
i am also very pleased that so many people from my group have expressed an interest in this social issue .
actually , i have a proposal .
also , as this is the first opportunity i have had , i should like to welcome the commissioner to the house for this debate .
the whole area of working time and the directive have created a lot of difficulties for individual members and also in member states .
i feel there are some areas within the present proposals which will create difficulties .
firstly , the overall cost of the directive would be far greater than that proposed under the impact assessment .
this is an extremely important sector .
it is important that they are included in the working time directive .
i am not taking out anything in that .
i ask for your support .
but i want to make a few points before i deal with that .
i do not know why that is the case .
it is just not acceptable .
this is a matter which concerns all of us .
this is naturally unacceptable .
secondly , we are talking about public health .
in relation to amendment no 5 i fully support it .
in conclusion , thank you .
i take note .
i would not , and i am sure no other colleague would either .
so how much more so dealing with technical issues .
mr president , i did not entirely understand the question .
obviously , this is of great concern .
the debate is closed .
it is important and positive that we should go through this process in order to reach an agreement .
we have accepted it , and i completely support our having done so .
in any case , the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy would support such an initiative if the committee responsible could see its way to come to such a decision .
there is no mention of this in the project , but i simply wanted to propose it here .
my second point concerns cooperation in the field of information and communication technology .
this will not benefit the development of information and communication technology .
the countries concerned of course are different .
that is quite clear .
that is precisely what we are doing .
the debate is closed .
this is not about development policy , it is about cooperation in the field of research .
for one thing , in my conclusions , i have accepted the proposal from the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities .
technical cooperation is important , of course .
agriculture is one area of research cooperation .
we could make significant progress in that area .
there is also talk about " the technology of the information society " being part of the cooperation referred to in the agreement .
but why is the content sector of the information society not included ?
the agreement now under discussion will provide a better framework than ever for this .
i believe that the cooperation agreement will further the implementation of these objectives .
this was not the case .
but we do not really know what is behind all this .
i thank you and the rapporteur , in particular .
this use must obviously be developed even further .
this agreement is therefore a positive thing .
the debate is closed .
i would like to encourage the commission to adopt that approach .
we benefit from it too .
the debate is closed .
how will we do this ?
again , the council agreed .
i would like to put forward another three points .
this is why i would like to ask parliament to adopt this directive .
nevertheless , i can go along with the rapporteur , and would like to thank him for his work .
we want to see this directive implemented as soon as possible .
but we can put that to one side for now .
we want to have the directive as soon as possible .
- of the energy before it even takes to the road .
finally , i would like to thank the rapporteur for taking on this report .
i do not think there are any more problems !
great !
we certainly have not .
we need action of a quite different kind for that .
but , as i say , i take the european parliament 's points of view seriously .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
european internal market
it is not only that .
it is something that goes much further .
until now , there has been a lot of very good legislation with very clear consequences , but it has been done without a strategy .
the action programme is now behind us .
what we need next is a strategy .
there will always be new decisions .
the position of parliament which is , of course , aware of the needs among citizens and within industry , is essential .
thank you for your time .
although it is a very general paper , it is still important .
i would also like to make a few comments about the amendments tabled on this motion for a resolution .
for that reason , we will not be voting for those amendments either .
with this in mind , i welcome the commission communication on the european internal market which we have before us .
clearly , the commission has had little time to draw up this document , and we have had even less time .
tomorrow we are going to vote on a motion for a resolution .
mr president , i too would like to thank the commission .
i would like my position to be very clear .
the internal market is a reality .
this to my mind is a very important point .
as far as this issue is concerned , we are aware and it is in hand .
and i believe that is not what the members of this parliament want either .
i could not agree more .
i would also like to thank them for their attention .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
you raised this issue during the last parliamentary term too .
we shall see if we can do something about this .
( the minutes were approved )
i think that the president will certainly welcome your proposal .
employment
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this means that legislative amendments may only be adopted without general conclusions .
that is really not on !
it would be wrong to increase the number of guidelines any further .
simply increasing the number of guidelines will not create one single job .
that is how i see the european model .
on that note , i ask you to vote for these two reports .
we should take a vote on it in that case .
it was hard work .
i would like to point a few things out .
mr president , employment policy is a national concern , and it shall remain so .
not one is on public investment .
it is just a question of how this is to be done .
there , the social partners in the labour market can themselves play the main role .
national member state governments must also take into account the provisions of the new european social fund regulations .
local job creation initiatives must be supported by national and european member states .
and this should remain so .
as such , the policy will need to focus on the local or regional job market .
mr president , we are being called on to debate the proposal to establish an employment committee .
statement by the president
the answer is no .
mr president , cooperation within the eu on economic policy has now been taken further .
now we are to discuss the guidelines for next year , that is to say for the year 2000 .
let me mention a few such areas .
that is not the first time we have said this .
no , i can understand that , but one might at least support one 's own proposals .
what is the connection , then , between economic development , employment and the social security systems ?
the answer is no .
we are talking here about the three countries which are outside the euro area .
it is indeed time for a change in policy .
it is not a fact .
it is essential for the european parliament to be involved in the guidelines , that much we agree upon .
we also need these specific criteria for employment policy .
we also need to call on the member states to do more than promote equal pay .
we need more scope for the investment required for the future .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the employment problem is not only an issue for the national states , but also for europe .
the committee is a first step in this direction , but it is not enough .
if we do not do the same for employment we will never achieve sufficient results .
they must also be given the opportunity to do this .
mr president , i have to speak about matters concerning work , social issues and employment .
but here , at the european level , we can do more .
i think that , in this area , the committee could be a very important step .
it is extremely important yet extremely difficult at the same time to have a monitoring system for the member states .
the next issue concerns information technology .
thank you , commissioner , for your contribution .
the debate is closed .
i take that to mean that they are in fact present .
well , in my opinion , this right has in fact been taken from us .
i now come to my second point .
absolutely .
this is a second reading .
very well .
the rapporteur has just made a proposal .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
thank you , commissioner .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i would like to see a vote on what we agreed in committee .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
there are many different reasons for this .
today i wish to express my view of the guidelines on employment for the year 2000 .
but they were not accepted .
thank you .
statement by the president
agenda
this is not the way to do business .
no .
( parliament agreed to the amendment )
president .
do we have enough time to consider this report as well , given how important it is for the future of the european union ?
madam president , i would like to support your proposal .
therefore , i entirely support your proposal .
ladies and gentlemen , let us take one thing at a time .
what is your position on this ?
madam president , it is as you have just said .
i just wanted to be sure that question time to the council would actually take place .
who would like to speak in favour of this request ?
( the order of business was thus adopted )
some people say that there is only one technology that can achieve this .
that is clearly wrong .
why ?
so we absolutely must do something about it !
we need to add something here .
madam president , the legislative project under discussion is very important for the issue of air protection .
i would now like to mention a change that would cost nothing .
it really costs nothing .
this is why we are under a certain amount of time pressure .
i heard very clearly what the rapporteur says about this .
i am also pleased with what the council adopted from parliament in first reading .
i will therefore vote in favour of all his amendments .
that would not be good for the environment in europe .
the question now is this : what are we to do ?
are we to vote for your amendments tomorrow or the day after ?
i would like to thank the rapporteur for his work .
i think perhaps that in future , with technical reports like this , the legal service should bring them into line with what we have already proposed and agreed upon .
this is an area where a lot more can be achieved .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
children and young people need our special protection , and unfortunately this still applies to women too .
one does not have to look far .
i would once again draw attention to this fact .
great !
this is why we must give full scope to this programme , both in terms of children on the one hand and of women on the other .
what it is going to change , commissioner , and how ?
however , legal measures will also be needed in individual countries .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this will clearly take a little time .
mr president , firstly i should just like to make a technical point .
the debate we have here today , which is very welcome , has been part of a long , difficult technical process .
"
these are not my words but the words of children and young people from my country , ireland , and other eu countries .
one of the main concerns of that convention is the right for children to live in peace .
we must support children 's rights in third countries , but also in our own states .
this also applies to children 's rights .
they also need to be implemented .
i ask for a report to be brought forward to show the state of law in each member country and the state of legal practice .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i should just like to make four basic points on the issue of the community directive .
a year on , however , the council has not even considered this directive .
it is high time that the right conditions for a council common position were created .
there is obviously a lack of political will in the council .
how does the commission view the situation , commissioner ?
i did not entirely follow you .
this directive will ensure that .
it is crucial that we let it be heard .
one day we will have to go further .
what does the commission have to say today about these two points ? nothing new , and we will get back to that in the year 2000 .
it is clear that something needs to be done about this .
we have made some progress .
it is a majority proposal .
we have problems with a number of governments .
i should like to thank the commissioner for what she has said .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i would ask you to take note of that as well .
( the minutes were approved )
system of own resources
this situation cannot be allowed to continue .
nevertheless , the commission could have done more , in fact i would go so far as to say that it should have done more .
i would ask you all though , to at least give me your support as far as these draft amendments are concerned .
we would like to change this .
this is not acceptable .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
if , in so doing , we are only ever going to try and reduce expenditure , then it will simply not be possible to do justice to our political needs .
we cannot accept this and we shall be voting against this report .
this is a fundamental issue .
who must pay ?
at the moment , it is the states , and states only .
it is essential for the matter of own resources to be the focus of the next intergovernmental conference .
this is why , on this matter , we agree with the commission 's current proposal .
we talk about democracy and transparency .
first of all i would say that anything that we decide in a democratic way , through the institutions of the union , about own resources , is what own resources are .
let me make one further point on this .
the enlargement of the eu is one such priority .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
therefore , we understand that it is not possible to include it within the guidelines .
the report now under discussion concerns agricultural expenditure .
for that reason , agricultural expenditure is the major consideration when we are discussing the eu budget .
in fact , the decision was also taken to establish measures for development aid in the agricultural policy sector now .
i believe that was an important decision .
the debate is closed .
"
in these cases the commission says : " no decision has yet been taken " .
that is our problem .
this was not always the case , as we have heard .
as rapporteur , i would like to know .
all in all , i welcome the fact that it has been possible , on account of this reduction in expenditure , to increase funds in the external action sector .
which list is that ?
mr president , i congratulate you .
a special procedure has been decided on .
the debate is closed .
environment and community energy policy
this communication from the commission takes the issue forward within the energy sector .
it is a good start and there is much more to do .
mr president , thank you very much .
it is a good report .
i also want to draw your attention to one aspect in particular .
this situation must change !
this will certainly not be the last debate on environment and energy policy that we have in this house .
our citizens expect and , indeed , demand that we do better .
what does not have a place in energy and the environment is nuclear power because it is not sustainable .
what do we want , and what is the way forward ?
in meeting this aim , the environment also has its own role to play .
the environment is , however , not the main objective of an energy policy , - and should not be .
in recent years , the european union has done much to achieve a more sustainable energy economy .
in connection with this report , there was a wish to discuss nuclear power , and how appropriate a means of production it will be in the future .
this is precisely the problem .
in other words , russia will turn to a region where these problems do not exist .
that too has been mentioned in this report .
all this requires money .
in my opinion , nuclear power is not the solution to the environmental problems of energy production .
nuclear power is not the solution .
we have made good progress where the environment is concerned .
nuclear power cannot be the answer to our problems .
i would like , in conclusion , to congratulate him on this .
one additional point , however : a common environmental tax for the whole of europe must become a reality .
this will be required .
therefore today 's debate is particularly appropriate .
firstly , i would like to point out that it is precisely the energy sector which has been the first to draw up a communication on environmental integration in its policy .
the debate is closed .
vote
before the vote , i would ask the commission to give its position on the amendments .
there are only three amendments , amendments nos 1 , 5 and 10 , which are not acceptable to the commission .
we are therefore going to vote against amendment no 1 .
we consider that the special conditions which apply in the fisheries sector are better taken into account in the council 's common position .
we think it is important that the social partners in the labour market should be involved in such important questions as the organisation of working time .
we cannot therefore vote in favour of this proposal from the committee .
it is more than time for this .
i fully share this point of view .
we can do nothing other than vote against this draft resolution .
the next item is the debate on the following reports :
we are talking about one of several proposed measures in this field .
it goes without saying that we should also adopt the amendment then .
however , two of these states are prepared to adopt the regulation we are discussing today .
the proposals that we have before us take matters forward but perhaps they do not go far enough .
naturally , this often results in a number of problems .
for this , i would like to express my thanks to the commission and the rapporteur .
my group can therefore back the report .
if these amendments were to be adopted , it would be difficult for me to support this proposal .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
it must also be clear that the particular country concerned requires considerable technical and financial support .
however , we cannot do this alone .
the international community must act together .
this is both a political and economic task .
i would also like to thank the commissioner for his report , particularly for his basic statement that there can be no compromise as far as nuclear safety is concerned .
in this sense , i would also like to offer my clear support to what the commissioner has said with regard to financial aid .
mr president , thank you , commissioner , for the information .
i shall now come to my question , commissioner .
something could go wrong and we need to offer assistance .
that does not come into it .
this is my answer to the very basic question which was asked .
the next item is the commission statement on the decisions taken at today 's meeting of the commission .
let me be very clear .
we hope not .
, commission .
that obviously was an issue of some considerable concern to me .
he is only doing his job .
that is what i have done . it is the first step .
no further time has been given .
those discussions continue in the hope that we can achieve a result .
but i may very well be wrong about that .
where is there more doubt than here ?
so that is my question .
i make the decision on the basis of that .
i cannot see that there is any lack of transparency in relation to that .
i think that this is a very important question .
did you take this into account today when you made your decision ?
can i request that we have some other time to ask the commissioner questions ?
the case for such a directive is clear .
question time ( commission )
part i
many thanks to the commissioner for his reply .
we have made them clear again and again .
no , mr president .
this is not the time .
let me deal first with humanitarian aid .
however , that is by the by .
this is my answer .
i thank you , commissioner , for your response .
but her response does not answer my questions .
i have not received a reply to this question .
this is always a difficult question to answer , especially before this parliament .
so it is very important that the countries implement this directive .
thank you very much , commissioner .
we have decided on a directive and the directive should be implemented .
mr president , commissioner , thank you for your reply .
this is indeed a matter for regional development .
can you tell us what the state of affairs is ?
i would like to ask all of you for your cooperation .
we will try to deal with this lack of time .
several member states do not have such legislation at the present time .
it is important that there should be legislation of this kind .
it is on this matter that i should like to see the commission take action .
that is not true .
i very much welcome the commission communication .
i fully agree with the honourable member .
how can we achieve this ?
i think that is extremely important .
but that is not all .
we should act in the short term with urgent measures .
mr president , i would like to refer back to the questions .
my second question concerns the proposals of the high level group , could this be possible in the short term ?
i would ask the commissioner to be as specific as possible - i know she is doing so - because we are out of time .
these are considerable , but they are still not enough .
the council regulation is clear on this .
that is what it is all about !
are there any comments ?
are there any comments relating to the minutes ?
( the minutes were approved )
this will be my main priority .
madam president , this morning i would like to focus on two main questions .
secondly , i would like to share one of my main priorities with you : the creation of a policy in the field of security and defence .
the only solution must be of a political nature .
we need to be in a position to act .
i consider it very important to continue this work .
the support of this parliament will be essential .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much for your attention .
of course we have no military role .
here we come to a crucial point .
i want to make one final point .
if you consider this to be necessary , then i believe we shall make good progress together .
in this regard i wish you every success in your work .
( applause )
my colleagues will comment on these issues later .
we wish you well .
foreign policy must also be open .
i hope that you will increase transparency in the work of the council in foreign policy also .
the criteria must naturally be the same for all .
but how many people know about this ?
how many people are talking about this ?
it was not a success .
i think that is the first matter to deal with .
and on the subject of the united states , i would like to ask you two very specific questions .
i think that he is right .
your task is certainly a very difficult one .
can this be true ?
you have said that the ministers for foreign affairs should be able to take far more decisions in this respect .
this is necessary for your role .
in principle , the union could make quite a few proposals .
this is why my view is that things must get done quickly , as quickly as possible .
does he agree with me that we need to have a council of defence ministers if we are to address these questions ?
is he saying , as i think he is , that turkey is vital to the success of the european defence initiative and we should take that into account ?
what would your comments be on these two events ?
once again , i wish you every success .
mr president , in the little time that remains i will try to deal with two or three issues of a general nature concerning the questions and matters which you have raised during this sitting .
and in this direction and in this effort you will find that i am working with you .
this has not happened before now .
there have been a good number of questions and it would take too long to answer them all one by one .
thank you for your support and your cooperation .
the debate is closed .
in our report , we also demand that the commission be successful in this matter and return with the right results .
what is really important ?
and quite right !
this should not be the case !
that will be done by my colleagues .
this is nothing new !
this in itself can provide more social balance .
these issues must be included in the wto negotiations .
we want to take the interests of developing countries into account and pay special attention to environmental issues and the fundamental rights of workers .
this is what it is all about .
parliament must be fully involved .
in this respect , i would once again like to make it absolutely clear that the commission and the council have our support .
but trade is not an end in itself .
let me say very clearly that free trade is not the same as fair trade .
how can agreements be reached ?
" .
in europe today we have extremely high standards , both with regard to environmental and consumer protection and to social protection of workers .
vote
mr president , the commission was able to accept the six proposed amendments .
now there are just four .
having accepted all six , i therefore accept the four , mr president .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we should be pleased with this .
i support this programme because of its social values .
the enlargement of the eu is one such priority .
the enlargement of the eu is one such priority .
i agree with this , in principle .
as such , i voted against these two amendments .
i am taking this matter up because i think it is important that we have some accepted form of procedure in view of what happened in my own case during the last parliamentary term .
but we live in democratic countries with democratic institutions like this parliament .
would this , i ask , put a stop to military action ?
we can fully agree with the points he raised .
i would now like to speak about the humanitarian crisis .
we have to stress to russia that we expect it to keep its word and look for a political , not a military , solution .
do we know ?
i simply must say this !
we expect the same of the council .
rather , we must reach conclusions .
i consider this to be an extremely difficult decision .
just as the others did !
only them !
this is the first thing .
we have taken up a very clear position .
this is necessary and right !
so where is the dialogue ?
mr president , we have had an excellent debate on this matter here in parliament .
all of us , the commission , the council and parliament agree on this situation .
the debate is closed .
that is why i think that it is so important to say that demand is a more important consideration than the particular system we have here at home .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very objective report .
i would especially like to stress the position of the least developed countries .
then what will we do ?
it can be made to happen .
many developing countries feel that free trade has not in fact been as free for them .
i can agree with him .
madam president , i would just like to say two things .
it is important to find a balance in this respect .
agriculture and fishing provide us with food .
we can only hope that this will be the case .
and from this point of view , we state here once again the need to respect environmental matters , the need to respect the consumer and the need to respect human as well as social rights .
however , the european union is not only an economic community but also a community of values .
allow me to consider two special aspects of what we are discussing .
i think that the question has been put in the wrong way .
we need both : aid as well as trade .
as a result of this , food safety would be in the balance .
but this is not the only reason .
an assessment of the present regulation would be a first step .
we want fair trade for everyone and by that i mean equal conditions for competition .
they are not equal in agriculture , or in cultural sectors .
he has presented a good report .
i am speaking , for example , about environmental standards .
the wto has said : in principle , this can be discussed .
i will therefore give it all my support .
nevertheless i believe in free trade .
as we well know , it is not within reach .
it is obviously up to each member of the wto to decide if there is a risk or not .
as far as services are concerned , i note the concerns that have been expressed .
he has not given me an answer .
may i have an answer ?
the debate is closed .
at the moment , i cannot tell you anything .
the third issue , together with the economy , is that of a " social europe " .
true , these are important , but they are not enough .
i want to mention five points in connection with which demands are being made in my part of our report .
central to all this is the reform of the council .
the commission presented its proposals last week , and now parliament is doing the same this week .
so far , all treaty amendments have increased the power for parliament .
this should also be the case now .
it is a system of open markets .
mr president , i would like to thank parliament for this report .
union enlargement will mean the reform of the institutional system .
tomorrow you will vote on parliament 's position on the year 2000 conference .
during our presidency , we have taken a step forward in this area .
we once again have before us important decisions to take on the future of the union .
and what is that line ?
it seems to me that this is an issue that this parliament should be involved in .
however , we have an opportunity and we must make the most of it .
there is no need .
the second reason is that it makes the case for more democratic procedures .
we need to take this state of affairs very seriously .
sometimes i doubt it .
i believe both of those are important aspects .
honourable members , mr president , institutional reform is not a political project .
i would like to say a few words about the issues involved in this reform .
how should we work ?
just now , i heard the president-in-office of the council mention enlargement which , he said , means " change " .
and then there are the other institutions .
our objective is to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion and to achieve this before the end of the year 2000 with significant results .
it is our place , and indeed my own , to see to it that we take part in this public debate .
in order to achieve this , more of a community approach needs to be adopted .
what is this question ?
if we do not answer this question , we will not find a solution to the three questions " left over " from amsterdam .
i should therefore like to encourage the council not only to respect parliament 's proposals but also to make them its own .
we need a europe which is able to act and which can also take necessary decisions .
as regards the draft :
this , too , i consider to be absolutely necessary , as well as being a good opportunity , especially in connection with the development of the area of freedom , security and justice .
we can only hope so .
thank you for that .
that is particularly clear from the difficulties between economic union and monetary union and the difficulties between the political union and the economic and monetary union .
budget policy , trade policy , tax policy and competition policy have been mentioned .
let us be aware of this and let us deal with this reform .
the debate is closed .
it is unacceptable .
this will be put to the house tomorrow morning to vote on .
question time ( council )
new guidelines were also provided for future work in the fight against drugs .
mr president , i can well believe that the council is concerned by what has happened .
my question , however , was different and was about past results .
that is my question .
i think this is very good indeed and i want to thank you very much for your answer .
my only problem is that these questions do not get out to the public .
we are certainly in agreement about that .
" 1 .
2 .
3 .
"
it is a long and difficult process .
what do we know about the situation ?
it is up to the commission to put forward something .
it is what they say that matters .
there is still a long way to go .
this is clear to us all .
nevertheless , i would like to take the discussion a little further .
i would like to ask a question .
at the same time , this would give the council good enough reason to say " there !
thank you very much for your answer .
as has been said , this matter comes within the member states ' area of responsibility .
i know that he will not cause one because i know him .
for this reason , it will be some time before a final decision is taken on the matter .
are there any comments ?
well , we are colleagues , and often agree , but that is not the point .
that is what i am here for .
sometimes in parliament the right hand does not know what the left one is doing .
i would like to ask you to make a little effort here .
but that does not matter .
( the minutes were adopted )
decision on urgent procedure
president .
madam president , i must comment here .
and we keep to our word .
but you never know !
well , we have heard your views .
it is quite clear that we are dealing here with an amendment to the rules of procedure .
( applause )
( applause )
agenda
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
that is not appropriate for the subject of this report .
we must have this discussion and bring it to a conclusion .
( applause )
if this report is going to be discussed then i would ask that we ensure that it be discussed today and that we also vote on it today .
( applause )
this proposal for a council regulation is an important proposal .
madam president , we have now heard the commissioner as well .
we need the system .
we need the vote today !
madam president , i agree , although i hope that there will be sufficient time to discuss my report this morning .
this is the issue .
i would point this out , in particular , to those members who were not members of the previous parliament .
that would have left us time to consider other questions in peace .
it is essential that this report be adopted today .
we are always subject to the law and also to criminal law .
the debate is closed .
what is its purpose ?
and that too is something quite essential .
there was a majority here , which was against my opinion as the rapporteur .
( applause from left )
what is our problem ?
( applause from left )
that is not a good thing !
and this is not proper .
this is absolutely crucial .
first of all , i have some questions for the commissioner .
the second point is the fundamental and most important one .
you are welcome to it , is what i say .
we take note of your request .
our position is quite clear .
we shall therefore vote in favour of the report .
i believe that we should take a different approach .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it is not only a policy matter for the ministers of health .
because drugs , mr president , will be with us for a long time to come .
as far as external trade is concerned , the committee on industry is aware that the trade policy can only do so much in the fight against drugs .
there is not really a european approach .
therefore , commissioner , you have the floor .
this must change .
thank you , commissioner .
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the decision )
i hope that is clear .
relating to amendment no 11
have you included that ?
i just wanted to make that clear once more .
this is an essential point which is really important .
we voted for it by a large majority in the committee .
i feel in any case that it should be " free and fair world trade " .
everyone agreed to that .
then we would have a result on the third point .
that is the amendment .
we will vote against that amendment .
no other amendment is possible .
i have said that we will vote against it .
we should vote on that .
the important thing is that we know what we are voting on .
we take good note of this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is not right .
the decision is , of course , his .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
madam president , the same applies to my report .
for good reasons there was a clear majority in favour of taking the vote today .
we can do this very quickly , in fact .
relating to amendment no 3
we had it just now in a paragraph .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i was very much against it .
that is all very well .
everyone is agreed on that .
but i doubt that this will be the case .
it is time for it to end .
there is , of course , no question as to the need for international economic regulation .
special , do not even think about it .
i think not .
that is why i voted against it !
i did not vote for it because i do not find the procedure and a number of regulations acceptable .
this is the reason i have voted against this report .
i now have three questions for the commissioner .
it is this with which the resolution is concerned .
unfortunately , this resolution is not sufficient to do justice to all the important aspects of this subject .
for this reason , i would mention three points in particular that are of great importance .
we only have to think about it .
some of them , in fact , did not start to concern themselves with this problem until the end of 1998 .
the joint debate is closed .
it is essential that this programme is allowed to continue .
member states of the european union have to support them - not just with words but also financial assistance .
the joint debate is closed .
there were a few questions regarding this area too .
you know the rules .
it is not a question time , it is a debate .
human rights
perhaps the council is not in a position to do any more , but what about us ?
the central problem before us , then , as a parliament , is the problem of a necessary joint european policy on security and foreign affairs .
they do not carry the peace process forward .
unfortunately not .
but the reality in kosovo is completely different .
why is that ?
i therefore believe that it will be very difficult for them to live together .
and we must help them .
it must work together with the population .
that is the great task before us .
there is still a lot to do !
that is certainly a great help .
people who support my government are welcome in kosovo .
"
why should they ?
this is , in fact , a matter of foreign policy .
the debate is closed .
this is not acceptable .
in any case , we will never be able to say : we did not know .
what are we doing in response to this ?
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
. i welcome the focus in the house today on the rights of children .
it is a matter of great concern that i should like to make quite clear once again on behalf of my group .
this is a very important report .
so with the action plan we have a good programme .
that must be the aim , even if it is very difficult to achieve .
i would first of all address a comment to the rapporteur .
why do i have to mention that again here ?
the main point , however , was that we did not see any need for them .
the european commission does the same in its plan of action .
so time then for a change of course .
it is therefore important that it should be precisely that policy which is the best policy which should stand as an example .
we are not there yet by any means . rather , there is a very great deal of work which remains to be done .
what is the issue ?
why ?
in any case , the appropriate action will have to be taken .
what does this mean ?
but action must be taken .
for this reason , the political will required by this report must become reality .
this parliament does not have the right to ask the member states for greater commitment and greater investment in the fight against drugs if it does not lead by example on an issue for which it has responsibility .
however , and this goes without saying , more resources are needed .
resources are required .
and unfortunately this is still not the case .
many of the amendments to this report before us are therefore right .
the debate is closed .
why ?
the committee did not like that .
mr president , commissioner , i should first like to congratulate the rapporteur .
in his request to speak he referred to an important field , that is the institutional field and everything concerned with it .
unfortunately this has become part of a system .
we must vote by a large majority against this amendment .
that is the reason why my group will vote against all these amendments in the vote tomorrow morning .
you would be the first to say ' no ' , i am quite sure of that !
but what does the whole debate show us ?
we have already seen the political effects that that has .
commissioner , you must together with us make that clear to the council .
the debate is closed .
thank you very much !
i ask this house , what are the member states ?
certainly not .
it makes cooperation more difficult .
this also applies to the investment bank .
the debate is closed .
that is why the european parliament must decide on the issue tomorrow .
i would like to make a few comments about your report .
according to our information , this is not the case .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
on the subject of yesterday 's minutes , mr president .
are there any other comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
does the commission wish to make a comment ?
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
thank you for your attention .
this presidency does not know what to do with these rules of procedure any more .
mr president , i did not ask a question and did not want a reply .
the treaty of amsterdam is now in force .
good morning , mr president .
firstly i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , the committee on legal affairs and the internal market and the members who have presented amendments .
this is an absolutely essential issue .
this point has already been made in this house .
the debate is closed .
( parliament approved the draft legislative resolution )
on the basis of this report the appropriate action will have to be decided .
europe cannot , and must not , give it up .
it is not for nothing that i am , in addition , a member of the committee on budgetary control .
the first question concerns the united states .
what do you plan to do about this ?
what does the european union plan to do in order to open up the american market to european products in this field ?
not a lot , but some .
are europe and the new commission prepared to do so today ?
we have to protect workers ' rights .
but what should we do ?
they were applied for a reason .
this has to stop .
everything must be done to prevent this .
i think that the commission , the council and the ladies and gentlemen here present will all agree that this situation must be brought to an end as soon as possible .
there is another problem .
i think that this is one of the questions which should concern us .
and i do not want this to happen in the future .
we have to look for and find a european solution .
we would do well to keep this in mind !
there have been discussions on this matter in the commission which for that reason alone we take very seriously .
we need free trade but we need fair trade , as has been said here .
there have been others and i will forward those questions to my colleagues .
the only possibility is that the commission and member countries take the issue up in the wto context .
the only possibility is that the commission and member countries take up this issue in a wto context .
there are many countries which are seriously concerned .
the debate is closed .
we have at all times supported the peace process in a positive and practical way through financial support .
there is still a long way to go .
thank you .
there are elections which are free and democratic .
could i speak , madam president ?
we just cannot continue in this way .
madam president . you are quite right in what you have just said .
i cannot allow a debate to start .
up to yesterday , he had not had a reply .
welcome
( applause )
statement by the president
madam president , this is a point of order on the agenda .
agenda
the next item is the agenda . the following amendments have been proposed :
( parliament approved the proposal )
( parliament approved the proposal ) president .
this item is therefore included under voting time tomorrow .
what is this basis ?
we also have a second plan .
we will not do this , because we do not have the power to do this .
i can give you a very specific example .
we also need a new approach with regard to the people of europe .
absolutely not .
this aspect is completely outside the area of competition .
i can give you a specific example of this .
i have a question for the commissioner .
the member is absolutely right .
however , i can tell the honourable member that the european authorities will work in this direction .
this means that it also has a political value of peace .
i have a question concerning the last comment made by the commissioner .
i believe that this is one of the key questions for europe and the world .
only then will we be able to make any real progress on this issue !
unfortunately , she is right .
will it happen ?
at this point we can do something .
unfortunately , i have no legal basis .
thank you , commissioner , and ladies and gentlemen .
the debate is closed .
the general affairs council is to adopt the decision made on this issue on our initiative .
a common defence policy is thus not being discussed .
what problems are there , then ?
thanks to these efforts , the summit will , i am sure , be a great success .
what are the necessary institutional reforms ?
i have held discussions with representatives from these three countries over the past few days .
what i mean is that we need to make reforms first .
we need european defence .
but when we talk of european defence , we also mean practical measures .
( applause )
secondly , a plan of action must be prepared .
what about the common policy on unemployment , or on employment for that matter ?
the third issue is turkey .
in fact , there is no doubt about the agenda for the summit .
this is something they do not want .
that is something i have heard too little about , not only from you , but also from the other governments of the european union .
we hope there will be support for our proposal .
the european commission 's transparency concerning candidate countries should be adopted by the european summit .
in this respect , it is important to develop a clear information strategy .
in fact , the same applies just as much to public opinion within the eu member states .
also , i could not agree more with the reason given in this respect .
how can it not be ?
we should not offer them anything less .
this is simply a fact .
we are now in a situation where , for the first time , full consideration must be given to the treaty of amsterdam in a meeting of the european council .
the first concerns the intergovernmental conference .
in my opinion , it is only right that issues relating to common foreign policy , defence and the economy should be discussed .
my second comment concerns the position of turkey .
we should take a year just to do this .
i simply mean we should make sure that the people are not put off .
we must have a european union with the power to take decisions .
as always , it will be a compromise resolution .
that is not enough .
so far , we have not seen that .
in addition , we have raised the issue of the information society in the area of employment .
then i will turn to what are actually the main issues .
the third group is those issues that one or more member states have raised .
but we did not receive support from the full 15 , which would have been required for example for these majority decisions .
i do not agree at all .
along with this , it is clear that we want to see an effective intergovernmental conference .
europe is a union of countries , and indeed we have called it the european union .
some think this development should go further while others would keep the situation more or less as it is .
the debate is closed .
statement by the president
to be effective , the eu must be able to achieve cooperation at many levels .
speaking in the european parliament , i do not have to single out the reasons why this work is necessary .
when we speak of human rights , transparency is of particular importance .
we must be fully prepared for this .
monitoring human rights in practice means monitoring the application of these human rights standards .
we in the union should thus make use of the experience of others .
i want to take up a number of questions , however .
the eu practice is obviously that we take a position on the action of the court when a decision has been made .
there are various initiatives which we could comment on if we had the time .
thank you .
the debate is closed .
turkey
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we are talking here about joint decision making , so the council cannot decide without parliament 's being heard .
i agree with the rapporteur that the vote on these reports should not now be taken off the agenda .
it is , however , important that we point this out at the present time .
that is important for our security and our future in europe .
for turkey , this now means that matters have become serious .
i would even go so far as to say that the european union should encourage cooperation between its member states and turkey .
we were , moreover , the first european union country to do so .
we have adopted the regulations ?
is that what we are going to say to the summit ? and for what ?
i just wanted to make that clear .
but i think that there is overall agreement on the matter itself .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
my proposed amendment of article 3 ( 2 ) was adopted by a large majority in committee .
who can be against that ?
firstly , i must stress the positive effect of her public health proposals .
the commission can , in principle , accept amendment no 2 , which makes this clear .
the commission has , therefore , asked parliament and council in article 3 ( 2 ) whether this should be taken into account .
the commission can also accept amendment no 4 in principle .
the commission can accept amendment no 15 in part .
so , thank you for that ; and thank you for the discussion .
the debate is closed .
we thank the council and commission for having accepted certain amendments .
we therefore welcome the council 's common position .
that is the first time that we have done so at european level .
there are therefore three points , i think , which need to be included in the directive and in this respect i support the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur .
secondly : we also need clear rules on using the data .
"
there is therefore no reason to refer to this matter again .
"
finally , i want to say a few words about amendment no 3 , part 2 .
i hope now that this house can offer its support so that the decision can be taken as quickly as possible .
the debate is closed .
mr president , this is a report on health and safety .
we do have to note , of course , that all this took rather a long time .
it is now 1999 .
so what was the key point in the negotiations with the council ?
this is of great importance .
why is this ?
we have a new commissioner and i know that she has a great deal of experience in this field .
why did i say this ?
mr president , i too am new .
i would also like to mention the matter of the application of this directive .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it is therefore high time to take the decision in question .
every necessary measure needs therefore to be taken in order to improve the situation .
i think it is good that we have had the opportunity to discuss this in the house today .
there are no major problems .
the commission has naturally made sure that we can make these changes and shall do so .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i speak on behalf of my group when i say that we fully support the rapporteur .
however , there is one very important point which we must consider .
i would like to comment on the four amendments which the commission cannot accept .
firstly , i will comment on amendment no 4 .
the commission is not in favour .
those are my comments , and i would like to thank you for your attention and thank once again the committee on agriculture and rural development .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , commissioner , allow me first to congratulate my colleague on her first report .
this is all positive .
this is still true .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
he should have given his report .
i shall do so .
mr president , i have a point to make on the same subject .
mr president , i asked for the floor yesterday but was not allowed to speak by the president at the time .
( the minutes were approved )
now , we have other real problems .
our main proposals are :
i would also like to comment on two other aspects .
mr president , the euro is already the second most important currency in the world .
i therefore back the technical measures proposed by the rapporteur .
after all , the euro needs to remain a success and we need to make every effort to achieve this .
i think that we should take action on this .
the important thing to do in these circumstances , though , is to support the development of the euro by having more coordination of economic policy within the european union .
the countries themselves should be allowed to decide which .
thank you for this report .
the debate is closed .
fisheries
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
it received a majority vote .
the discussion on the common organisation of the markets does not end there .
the european market is not a closed market .
in the context of discussions like these , we need to show our support for the fishing trade .
we wish to go even further than the proposals made by the commission .
i would like to comment just on three points .
the only question in this respect is whether they actually go far enough .
that is what we propose .
i am very pleased to note , madam president , that the european parliament is in agreement on this point .
the debate is closed .
vote
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the joint text )
that must be the crucial point for us .
( parliament approved the legislative resolution )
( parliament approved the legislative resolution )
welcome
it is not before time !
this is serious at a time when the euro is going through a crisis of confidence .
for all these reasons , i shall be voting against this report .
i note your comment .
ladies and gentlemen , we cannot start a debate on the subject , especially if the party concerned is not present .
so what is going on ?
does this mean that i am not a european ?
agenda
the next item is the order of business .
i think that is all we can do .
we feel that the european institutions must now draw attention to this matter .
( parliament approved the request )
why is this urgent ?
this is an important issue .
as regards the order of business , i would like to stress that the matter is , in fact , urgent .
ladies and gentlemen , we cannot start a debate on this subject .
who is to speak in favour of this request ?
we have achieved a great deal .
however , since much remains to be done both within and outside europe , we should at least draft a clear opinion on the subject in this parliament .
madam president , a point of order .
therefore we could put it under a motion for debate at some point in the future .
why ?
i take full responsibility for the risk
what direction should we be going in and what do we have to do now ?
firstly , institutional reform of the wto .
this is the direction we will work in , if the council and parliament are in agreement .
people are right to say that the procedure should have been better .
we need better decision making .
it can be done in international discussions .
that is not what we want .
i believe there are good opportunities for making further progress .
there are good proposals out there .
that is precisely what people are concerned about .
how do we make this work ?
for us this means that we have a clear responsibility to take the lead on world trade .
we also need to make this clear .
the time is right to do so !
in any case , the conclusion that i draw is that this is the way forward .
i shall now make a few comments about the essential points .
my second comment concerns the institutional business of the wto .
a third comment on the environment .
we shall have to think about this , and , when the time comes , present our proposals on the subject to the council and parliament .
if that was the case then so much the better .
the debate is closed .
this is very serious .
the same applies to the structural funds .
mr president , i welcome the fact that at last , we are discussing this report .
in particular , we need to see a reform of the financial regulation .
nothing new there , for this has been the case for years now .
firstly , the member states really must take responsibility now .
this is not a good state of affairs as far as the european parliament is concerned .
i hope that in the end we shall be able to see our way clearly here .
you see , all we did to you was to prevent you taking part in a sitting .
third , parliament must put its own house in order .
it is not possible for them to come up with a positive opinion .
there is a need for the member states to take greater responsibility .
in fact , that matter was closed a long time ago .
this is , of course , not true .
the debate is closed .
the issue of education in the europe of the future is also the issue of the future of europe itself .
this is particularly important in the light of the enlargement of the eu towards which we are working .
in terms of content , we have achieved all that we set out to achieve .
what do i mean by this ?
europe is the future and in order to achieve this future , we need the young .
mr president , this is important now but this will certainly be important in the future too , with a view to enlargement .
it is excellent that we can now adopt this programme , which is so important for the citizens of europe .
in my opinion , there should be a review of the procedures with regard to these matters .
i would like to express my thanks for all this work .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
first of all , the implementation of community policy .
is it ?
for that reason there is not very much left to say .
the debate is closed .
we can adopt it , put it to one side and everything will take its course .
not for me !
the new members of this house will have to look it up .
parliament has adopted it .
the debate is closed .
what is it about ?
why should the directive not apply in this case ?
why not indeed ?
commissioner , that is why i am making this request .
clearly specific interests have been at work here .
mr president , this is an important directive .
the rapporteur said that this is also an example of good cooperation between the three institutions .
it is important for another reason .
so far , so good .
so tell me where the problem is .
i hope that we will come back to this in the future .
we have here a good example of a europe which is close to the people .
i would simply ask the commission and the council to make an effort in this matter and go along with parliament 's position .
they should use that opportunity !
this is quite something .
we are not in a position to do this .
the debate is closed .
what are we talking about here ?
we need to be aware of this . that is what this is all about .
no , of course that cannot be the case !
there was a majority against the report .
i believe that this is unacceptable .
this is what has happened here .
the negotiations were long and hard .
for this reason i believe that this is a good report .
let us do away with it !
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is not the case !
it is we who are to decide whether this is to become a reality .
i would therefore address the commission and ask if they are really serious about this .
i would ask the commission why .
do you not finally see that this is the wrong approach ?
we must give it our support .
we know what we need to do .
our group is therefore going to vote in favour of all the amendments from the rapporteur .
mr president , there is no doubt that the regulation in question is extremely important .
the environment minister is behind them .
the commission can therefore accept this amendment in principle .
the commission cannot therefore accept it .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i expect that will happen again before too long .
the consumer has a right to know .
i will support that .
but how practical is it ?
is it going to work ?
we too welcome the fact that there has been some movement at last .
i do not believe that this has anything , anything at all to do with it .
so why is it 1 % ?
means for control exist . they can be effective if the public authorities have the political will to use them .
mr president , i would also like to mention another issue .
at present , we are only dealing with food available to the consumer .
thank you for this important discussion even though the circumstances are not the best at the moment .
the debate is closed .
i would like to hear the opinion of the committee responsible regarding this request for urgent procedure .
who will speak on behalf of the committee ?
firstly , this is an urgent matter which needs to be agreed this year .
secondly , we agree with the objective .
( parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
president .
we could see this coming for a long time now .
madam president , we have discussed this in the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy .
indeed , it is one of my objectives .
let me take these in order .
first , enlargement .
second , defence .
and i do not consider this to be the best policy to fight unemployment .
discussions on this will start this week .
madam president , the european council approved the presidency 's report on the intergovernmental conference .
in my view , it could turn out to be a very important meeting .
the possibility !
the same applies in the other groups .
why ?
these are very important decisions .
a final word , madam president , regarding an issue which concerns my group very much .
at amsterdam a common foreign and security policy was referred to .
these decisions should be taken to the eu court of justice .
whether or not the decision on turkey was for the greater good of the union and turkey , only time will tell .
we very much doubt it .
what is our common european culture ?
the fact that it is on the agenda means , as i understand it , that we have to go in that direction .
there has been much discussion here on security and defence policy .
they are all issues we have in common .
i consider it necessary to return to this subject .
no country can say that they do things best .
we must understand one another , but the direction must clearly be towards greater transparency .
from the point of view of a small country we need a strong commission .
it is a decision which has yet to be implemented .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
her commitment found its place in this house .
we must put an end once and for all to the idea that the european parliament has few powers .
it is essential that you should make your point of view heard on this institutional reform .
( applause )
kosovo had humanitarian aid , here there is nothing .
that is the situation .
so what did the council do ?
i , for one , do not know .
i should like to refer in particular to turkey .
it is essential for there to be general majority decision making and increased cooperation .
together we can achieve a great deal .
we see the european model as a social order for the social market economy .
not from a member state and certainly not from a candidate country .
turkey is a candidate .
no other way forward is possible .
these changes are in turkey 's own interest .
but we cannot do the work for turkey .
but i believe that there has already been a great deal of progress .
allow me to make one last comment .
excellent progress has been made with the foreign and security policy .
parliament must ensure that this is put in order .
and this is what concerns us .
the debate is closed .
2000 budget
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
and on
at present such a programme has not been proposed , however .
the council adopted , for example , almost all the european parliament 's amendments relating to administrative expenditure , many of which concerned internal policies , which we know are of special interest to you .
we voted on the first reading three months ago .
so , what is the position ?
i have no idea !
will you be making proposals to us ?
in this context , what is the position of parliament ?
well , we are after five things .
firstly , the second reading vote should be as close as possible to the first reading vote in parliament .
what is the state of play ?
so , the question remains .
such were the terms of the compromise .
will it be done ? will you do it ?
i have no idea .
this is what we are doing .
it is not a war plan , it is a plan for cooperation .
the council has adopted all of parliament 's amendments .
finally i would like to say a few words in general about budgetary procedure .
from this we may draw at least two conclusions .
secondly , the european union has two budgetary authorities , parliament being one of them .
we need a budget for next year , and it must be achieved .
we have now reached the point where there is fundamental agreement on fundamental points .
no , it is a task for today .
i shall do my very best to ensure that the programmes in this area get off to a good start .
the negotiations were long , but we are now at the point at which agreement can be reached .
i would also like to welcome the decisions taken by the council and the commission .
that money is necessary and we are very pleased that you agreed to it .
something must be done quickly .
i have time to make only two points .
thank you very much , madam president-in-office of the council .
commission communication - decisions taken at that day 's meeting
the next item is the communication by the commission on the decisions taken at today 's meeting .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much , and i would firstly like to congratulate the president .
thank you , mr president .
mr president , thank you very much for the question that i have been asked .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
first part
naturally , we hope that , as far as possible , this policy will be in line with the transport policy of other member states and that of the commission itself .
the total cost remains the same , of course .
the total cost is what it is .
in short , progress is being made .
but instead of just talking about it i am trying to do something about it .
president .
this is unacceptable .
what will you focus on ?
a good deal has in fact been done .
this is the second purpose .
it is absolutely crucial that we should work together in this very important area .
commissioner , thank you for your reply .
we will go on doing so .
thank you very much , commissioner , for your positive and specific answer .
but i believe we still have more progress to make there .
the commissioner has the floor .
thank you , commissioner , for your answer .
would that not help ?
you will see , commissioner , that this is a british question , but you have a right to reply if you think it appropriate .
statement by the president
you will be doing us all a favour if you keep more or less to the time allowed .
that was too little as far as we were concerned .
we here in parliament want to avoid this .
we made this very clear during the budgetary procedure .
we call on you to move towards us and we will move towards you .
i would like to move on to the budget itself .
firstly , i would like to focus on the agricultural budget itself .
mr president , we are now into the last stage of the budget for 2000 .
the first concerns kosovo .
it will be the same with the budget , madam president-in-office .
we cannot accept that .
in this discussion parliament has been more up to the job than the council .
i welcome this agreement and this commitment .
this must be a very serious debate when i see the number of people who are here from the council .
let me say this : we have no problem .
you do .
we know that .
even at the second reading it did not put money on the line - we did .
but that is another matter .
let me say one last thing .
i too should like to start with a thank you to my colleagues in the committee on budgets .
i consider that the european parliament has been successful on this point in these budgetary negotiations .
we all know that enlargement to the east was also an issue .
i think this can be established by each government in its own member state , and that we can then find a joint solution to the problems .
i think that parliament too , with its own budget , must do as it would be done by .
that too is a very important point .
mr president , to be a rapporteur or not to be rapporteur ?
mr president , we are going through a difficult time in the budget .
this is extremely important .
for the first time , women are in the majority at european level .
when we talk of giving , we should also think about what we will be taking .
mr president , i did not understand a thing ; i especially did not understand about point 1 .
in order to clear up this point , i shall call upon you once more , madam minister , and then the commission .
we are working on this .
thank you , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i think we are making good progress .
what is needed is a court that is , and is seen to be , independent of member states ' interests .
the debate is closed .
i would like to make a few important points .
there never has been .
first we will work with the council to review the implementation of the common strategy for russia .
we are doing this .
these include views from members of this parliament .
but perhaps i can single out one or two particularly important points .
i should like to make one last point .
thank you very much , commissioner .
may i say , that is not quite in order .
the debate is closed .
and this has to happen at the political and not just the technical level .
i am open to any discussion where you have interests to follow up .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
statement by the president
mr president , you are quite right .
welcome
we still need new measures throughout the community and the member states .
i believe such progress has been achieved .
i am very pleased that the european union , along with many other parties , expressed its support for that idea .
however , it is crucial that we get the process right .
we need to set a good example ourselves .
yet have we not agreed to take responsibility ?
business and governments now know that the only way forward is to include the environment and the principle of sustainable development .
finally , the people must be made aware for it is through them that progress will be achieved .
this is unacceptable and europe must say so .
finally , europe must act within its member states and at community level .
i think it is time for the eu to take the initiative and do this .
it is therefore absolutely necessary to take political measures .
i agree with what everyone has said here .
there are two main aspects to this as far as the european union is concerned .
the debate is closed .
thank you , commissioner .
this must continue .
the debate is closed .
the second area is education .
the third area is health .
we agreed to increase resources for women 's health .
thank you , in any case , for having taken up this very important question .
i find this unacceptable .
it should be made absolutely clear that this needs to be done .
vote
the next item is the vote .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
i have tabled amendments to that effect .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament approved the joint text )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
furthermore , any solution would have to avoid a conflict with third countries ' legislation .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
mr president , i would like to hear the opinion of the commission on the amendments which we have just adopted .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , i raised this issue before , at the other sitting .
this is a decision for which it will be difficult to achieve a balance .
no it is not !
we are not having a debate on this .
we have a joint motion by five political groups .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
the house has made its decision . we are not discussing it .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
that is my first point .
the education of citizens in the european union is very important .
to be effective , these measures must deal with two concerns .
i can only agree with what has just been said .
we must now consider these issues .
a world environmental organisation must be created with real powers .
we were aware of their concerns and finally , the reason behind them .
mr president , on behalf of myself and the other labour members , i want to point out why we voted against today .
today i will just mention two points .
in this area too , i believe that where there is a will , there is a way .
what actually happened ?
an amendment must be made through a proposal which must be discussed in the committee responsible .
the answer is no .
what about the european union ?
how can the european parliament carry out its task in this respect ?
i believe we should see this as being very important indeed .
i say this after 20 years ' experience of the united nations .
do not see this as being something especially for the women .
i would like to single out the last initiative of the women 's committee on the strategy against violence .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this approach is in the interests of all parties .
thank you for your attention .
thank you , commissioner .
madam president , i should like to add to that .
this parliament has the right to decide alone .
then we shall consider how to deal with the council .
it is a good week for this point to be brought to our attention .
it is far too important .
it makes no sense !
it is a question of respect for the issue and for european consumers .
i have here the text of a decision made by the agriculture council .
the council should therefore be here .
i have a proposal to make .
i should now like to move to put it to the vote .
madam president , i raised a point of order some time ago .
i therefore support the motion .
it is therefore as a result of this vote that we have this agenda for today .
that is not possible if he is not here .
you have not allowed us to vote .
i should have put it to the vote .
i have been in the european parliament for 10 years , during which most of my time has been taken up with environmental policy and consumer protection .
madam president , this is not only a crisis for british farmers , it is a crisis for french farmers as well .
but above all it is a crisis for the european union .
france has to decide whether it is in the eu or not .
if it is in the eu it must play by the rules .
the second legal problem is one of legal responsibility .
it is completely clear why this is the case because we have one internal market , we have an open market .
i want to look today at the decisions which have been taken in the light of the commissioner 's earlier statement , to which very few have so far referred .
what happened as a result of that ?
i believe he is trying to do it .
this is an extremely important debate .
could i first of all address my comments to the commissioner ?
we know that it is extremely difficult .
i also think you were used by the british government .
i fully share this point of view .
this is what we demand of you , commissioner .
we understand .
let me now deal with the many important questions you have raised on this issue .
let me say this .
that was the first opportunity the commission , or rather i , had to give serious consideration to france 's response to this issue .
further discussions took place following that .
progress has been made .
we must focus on the public health aspect of this .
all of this takes time .
it requires once again certain criteria to be present .
however , i should say that if i feel it is the appropriate way forward , that is the course of action that i propose to adopt .
he asked me to deal with this .
such a situation does not exist in the scientific world .
they have to be independent and be seen to be independent .
commissioner , thank you for your statement .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
mr president , this is a point of order .
is that really true because it is very hard to believe ?
thank you very much , madam president-in-office of the council , for the reply you have given me .
we ask europe to become more involved .
is the council aware of this ?
madam president , thank you for your reply .
i do not know if you have asked a specific question .
the president-in-office of the council has the floor .
mr president , i have already said that money is being used for humanitarian aid .
unfortunately , however , it is not always possible .
in fact , it was a question .
there has been a question , to which the president of the council may reply .
madam president-in-office of the council , there is a specific and clear question and you may reply .
mr president , the minister has given the right answer .
the problem is that the second part of the answer should be to say what she is going to do to make sure that it is implemented .
. -
thank you for your reply .
my question referred to this political issue and that is why i asked it .
. -
however , as the honourable member quite rightly points out , this is not a question of a practice that might even be adopted in the internal systems of all the member states .
state aid and competition policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
( parliament approved the request )
" i could not agree more .
all these areas are very difficult and could cause problems between parliament and council .
we are being called upon to deal with a most serious matter .
this is unacceptable .
mr president , first of all i want to thank you .
the discussion in the council was a difficult one .
let this proposal be one part of this new approach .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president . i wish to speak on the same point .
mr president , i am not quite sure what i am being asked to do at this stage .
that too is a council decision .
despite all this , i still have to present my report to you .
as yet , nothing has been approved .
why ?
if they cannot be accepted , then again we have a problem .
what did we do in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy ?
the commission must therefore be prepared to answer the question of why it did not take the member states to task earlier .
this is not good enough .
i do not believe it is good enough .
it is therefore completely unacceptable that the commission should not have put this important area in order .
everyone has made an effort !
there was good coordination between the committee on agriculture and the committee on the environment .
now to the role of the commission .
consumer interests must come first .
if necessary , we will call on the court of justice .
we will take a hard line on this .
who are the pressure groups ?
can you tell us commissioner , what proposals you have presented to the council ?
these are certainly not budgetary measures .
in these circumstances , the commission has a responsibility to act .
it is in this context that the main debate should take place .
i have always been open with parliament .
i do not accept it .
they are serious conclusions based on the council 's action .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that cannot be !
thank you to all those who were involved .
mr president , i am not speaking on behalf of my group .
we know that .
if we did not know that , why would we ban it ?
but i do not believe they are so concerned .
mr president , we are able to support the rapporteur 's opinion , but i should like to make a few comments .
that is to say , we support article 1 .
we have agreed on amendment no 3 .
as i have said , it was agreed with the commission .
the debate is closed .
thank you for coming , thank you for being with us and thank you to the members .
are there any comments ?
are there any other comments on the minutes ?
i will see if it is possible to go further .
( the minutes were approved )
vote
this is in the interests of all the groups .
madam president , i have no comment to make .
we should vote .
i agree .
thank you , commissioner .
madam president , for the benefit of all our colleagues , i shall tell the council and our members about the two decisions which it took yesterday .
these are the two decisions taken yesterday .
( the commissioner present did not wish to speak )
a decision must therefore be made .
i completely agree .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is the right time as we are now going to vote on the budget .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
thank you , we will note this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
madam president , i have three points to make .
thank you , madam president .
thank you , madam president-in-office of the council .
( applause )
2000 budget
i hope that a way can be found in the council of ministers of increasing this budget line to eur 15 million , as in 1998 and 1999 .
the efforts made in the budget to reform the common agricultural policy and reduce its costs are a step in the right direction .
it must be possible to guarantee food safety throughout europe .
we view this as something positive .
who can they turn to ?
what is really important , however , is that we should together fight for the right to do this .
we believe that this is important for democracy .
what is going on ?
are they available ?
parliament has taken note of the fact that turkey has been included as a candidate country .
this is why it was not the right time .
( some applause )
i think not .
that was a political decision .
that is a political decision .
for various countries in europe , this is an urgent matter .
i actually feel that this aspect is given too little consideration .
you understand the importance of the subject .
what does it mean and what could it do ?
is no serious work being carried out on them ?
such is life .
perhaps that is precisely why i am in favour of competition , but i am also in favour of a european cultural policy .
however , i now have a problem commissioner .
but what is the commission doing about this ?
this would be in the interests of the consumer .
we need to avoid this situation at all costs .
the question is , how can it be done ?
account has even been taken of recent developments .
i should therefore like to stress just a few points once again .
commissioner , you said that you had never seen the need for conflict between culture and the market .
i share this view , provided that we state clearly what we mean by market and what we mean by the purpose of competition policy .
we need time .
that is fundamental .
she is right .
thank you very much for your attention .
i would like to begin on a positive note .
some of the eu countries did not want to agree to the ban in the first place .
we should have done something long before .
this is also unacceptable .
this is the principle on which our policy is based and nothing will change in this regard .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
to improve things we need to change the quality of government .
she could see no future and no hope .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
human rights
2 .
3 .
we expect a response from the council in this respect ; a response and a commitment which is also political .
how many others are in the same position ?
the members of parliament can question ministers in parliament at any time .
this was what brought about that change .
i believe that the whole world is aware of their situation and for this reason has supported this initiative .
why have we held back ?
( applause )
we must help them and ensure that a proper action plan is implemented to support their work .
( de ) thank you .
( applause )
it is a political issue .
that is what is required .
given the time available , i should just like to make a few comments on these individual issues from the commission 's point of view .
that applies to the cases referred to here .
i think we are all in agreement on that .
thank you very much , commissioner .
international criminal court
unfortunately , we know that there is a great need for such a criminal court .
that is precisely the problem .
the plan for an international criminal court is another step forward in the creation of an international humanitarian legal system .
member states and candidate countries of the european union should , of course , lead the way .
there are two reasons for this .
thank you for that statement , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
there have been a large number of these in recent years .
this is not something the european parliament can do anything about .
i do not think , given the protection of parliament 's rights , that we can simply act as if this situation did not exist .
allow me to say a few more words about the problem of the risk area .
you did not mention this .
are there any comments ?
this is a proposal without debate and we will not have any opportunity therefore to debate the amendments being put forward .
they are in line with the procedure .
unfortunately , the decision was taken that this would be put without debate and the amendments are in order .
they are extremely important .
this is clear .
therefore , i would like to hear the commission 's opinion with regard to this point in the debate .
nevertheless the information is necessary for a parliament discussing the subject .
all that information is extremely important .
it is very hard to understand why we do not have better cooperation from all the member states .
it does , however , go some way towards meeting european parliament requirements .
all the other matters that we want to include in this regulation will therefore still be a matter for debate .
the commission is very pleased about the global support expressed in the report for the draft council and parliament decision .
the overall assessment of these actions by the commission is positive .
an effort should be made to adopt this proposal after first reading .
therefore , i hope that the commission will accept it , because we have provided all the means for this proposal to be approved at first reading .
mr president , just a short comment on amendment no 5 .
unfortunately , we are not able to accept amendment no 5 because we know that the council would not accept it .
the debate is closed .
i shall now come to the point .
that is why the commission cannot adopt these amendments in this situation .
the debate is closed .
( parliament approved the legislative resolution )
the funding is received , but the situation does not improve .
to this particular consideration we can add a second .
kosovo is no better off at the moment .
mr president , commissioner , the european union has set itself four major objectives .
firstly , the necessary reforms within the institutions and the eu member states .
this agreement is now in place .
this would put the community in a difficult situation regarding both these two countries and the international community .
the debate is closed .
following the vote on the amendments
you may do so .
having said that , parliament has reached the end of the agenda .
madam president , on a point of order .
madam president , on a point of order .
why has there been no health and safety committee meeting since 1998 ?
agenda
according to its president , it is in a position to do so .
all of the others were of a different opinion .
that was the decision .
i should now like to comment on the issue itself .
there is no such document !
decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .
it is not a lot to ask .
thank you very much .
my vote was " in favour " .
clearly there is a problem here .
that being the case , i shall have to make a decision .
we shall continue with the other amendments to the agenda .
that did not happen .
this is an important matter .
you did not call me either .
i congratulate him on his excellent report .
when it comes to safety my group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .
madam president , i would like to make a few comments .
in short , the issue is an important one .
i would like to mention one final point .
i should like to make just a few comments .
my third point has also been mentioned already .
but i would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the commission .
the debate is closed .
i hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow 's vote .
this directive is a contribution to this .
i hope that the commission is able to accept the present amendment .
we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .
the debate is closed .
structural funds - cohesion fund coordination
welcome to parliament !
parliament makes demands here that are of central importance .
i think that this work has been carried out extremely well .
therefore , the commission should address the issue once and for all .
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the structural and cohesion funds .
the first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
we still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the union 's fundamental objectives .
this is the purpose of these guidelines .
the debate is closed .
social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union
they are supported by appropriate european union structural fund activities .
what is the result ?
we must give them this opportunity .
what is a fair society ?
it only remains to put this principle into practice .
so much for the quality .
i should like to mention a few specific points .
several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion , and your rapporteur mentioned some of these .
this is my first point regarding the policy .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i refer to item 11 on the order of business .
i understand what you are saying .
we have taken note of this .
thank you very much .
( the minutes were approved )
reform of european competition policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
that is why there is an urgent need for reform , and no one takes issue with this in debate .
with all due respect for the principle of competition , competition is not , however , an end in itself .
this being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .
the internal market is the basis for our work .
parliament and the commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens .
all this is to the good of the consumer .
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .
the main objective of the union 's competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid .
we want a true culture of competition in europe .
but let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us .
should we not be discussing this issue ?
when will we debate that ?
what is being done may well be very important , but it is still not sufficient .
if this comes to nothing , then the government has to step in .
they are still in training , as it were .
a reform of this point was therefore also necessary .
for these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .
this is why i give this report my full support .
that is the context in which i want to consider the commission 's proposals .
he mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .
that is precisely what we do not want in the european union .
this is unacceptable to my mind .
this is unacceptable in my view .
there was no majority for this at the time .
i consider this to be unacceptable .
i agree with this request .
i agree with the rapporteur on two issues .
firstly , i agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all member states and , secondly , on the need for transparency with regard to this aid .
with what aim ?
many of the report 's conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .
the form the aid takes is important .
this is not in question .
what is the commissioner 's opinion of this ?
we all agree on this .
this is therefore an aspect to be considered .
this then is the idea of monitoring implementation .
why ?
the first is greater transparency .
the joint debate is closed .
protection under criminal law of the union 's financial interests
after five years only four have done so .
i call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote in favour of this report , which the committee on budgetary control adopted with a large majority .
we need to do something about it .
we need to take this responsibility seriously .
this is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , i think .
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur .
yet , every year we have the same problem .
so the legal framework , mr president , is already in place .
mr president , it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the european union , more so these days than there used to be .
i do not believe so .
it is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .
but the question is now : is the european union doing anything about it as well ?
the answer to this is that we know very little about this .
so a great deal has to be done in this area .
it is , in fact , something very positive .
we need a public debate on this .
mr president , i would very much just like to add to two particular points .
we obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .
i am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .
vote
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
procedure without debate :
mr president , as far as the second reading is concerned , the commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by parliament .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this can be clearly seen in the regulation before us .
parliament voted in favour of this text .
i will not do so .
nevertheless , perhaps we should ask ourselves whether we need to do more .
this legislation is still recent .
why not ?
what is now needed is action .
finally , there is the lack of transparency .
it is up to the members states and the community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this .
whose turn is next ?
and this is the result .
we know what actually happened .
many thanks for this .
but this is not in place .
mr president , i would welcome some action in this area .
mr president , we have already had this discussion so many times in the past .
so what are we to do now ?
what are we to do now ?
i will tell you a few things we should do .
just you go home and say : " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date " .
i do not think that we can accept their procedures .
within the commission , the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing .
i cannot accept this .
by now they are far away .
things could well continue in the same way .
mr president , i welcome the statement from the commissioner .
in addition , i should like to make a number of comments :
i would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken , which was mentioned by the commissioner and some of my colleagues .
i believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard .
it is clear that there is no lack of legislation .
in my opinion , the commissioner is quite right .
" who will provide us with new jobs ?
in fact , i believe that things have been done by the commission , but there is still more to do .
that is the reality .
we already have legislation .
i will end now .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
how so ?
i would like to say , though , that this is not sufficient .
above all , i think that public opinion will see this solution as unacceptable in terms of our political responsibility to europe .
i think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it .
we should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact .
this is wrong !
the citizens of the european union expect solidarity , also from within this community .
i say they have a right to solidarity .
of course , there is a need for solidarity here .
that is important .
it was very small .
i thank the commissioner and support him very much in his european protection force .
this money is available now , this year .
food safety
the next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the commission .
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .
would this be in the interests of europe 's citizens ?
this is a major task .
parliament will have a key part to play in this debate .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his statement .
that is very much the right approach .
that is the one word i am talking about .
that cannot continue .
thank you , commissioner , for your statement .
that is an issue for consideration and discussion .
there may be a number of views on that .
this situation can be achieved over a period of time .
the food safety authority 's situation is quite different .
colleagues , i am in a very difficult position because i cannot change the agenda .
question time ( commission )
first part
thank you for your reply .
i should like to make the following points : turkey is now a candidate country .
so much for the political aspect .
in the case of turkey it is different .
i do not have these concerns .
if not , why not ?
that is also mentioned in the report .
i cannot answer that question .
of course i can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .
but for my part , i am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts .
let me make clear to the honourable member what the position is .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner .
according to the rules of procedure , you are not required to reply .
second part
that is naturally unacceptable .
in addition to national programmes , the european union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors .
thank you , commissioner for your reply .
however , my question for a very long time has been this : what happened with previous policies ?
how many people found work ?
if you cannot tell us for this year , then last year and the year before .
what has been done about training ?
of course it is as you say .
this is an important aspect of this initiative .
i should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget .
firstly , i agree with you entirely . account will be taken of the information society ; that was something which i too mentioned .
i would thank the commissioner for her answer .
we congratulate you .
this has now been done .
this is in place too .
it did this as well .
we want more than that , however .
but we need that reform process .
it is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it .
it groups them together and that is very important .
there are two issues i would like to draw your attention to .
we have to get this right .
we need proper information , given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past .
we hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform .
we have put down an amendment to that effect .
it is about a commission which is no more .
there is now a new commission .
we have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type .
that is just the way things are , however .
it is the aim of other demands in the report to increase transparency .
i also second your demands on this point and will see to it that the commission does what it can to have them implemented .
the debate is closed .
in order to achieve this , action is required in four areas .
changes to the financial regulation will be required and parliament must have its say on those changes .
urgent change is required today .
enlargement of the union is just a few years away .
it is an excellent report .
it is clear that we need to see a change in the financial regulation .
that is important .
i will give you one example of this .
it is clear that is not acceptable .
is this possible ?
we are now four months down the line .
mr president , this report is positive but , actually , we need more than this .
how should we deal with this ?
allow me to start with the most important demand .
i would in any case like to congratulate him on his report .
this is the best support we can give to european democracy .
and so it is the " two key " principle that applies here .
so i refer to the things i do not agree with .
this report is about the commission .
there is no need for us to bring parliament into the discussion on the commission .
most of the report is about financial control .
they have very little of it .
i hope that the commission will use it in its reform work .
it is just a question of how .
what we need , then , are basic administrative regulations for the eu , for its institutions and for the eu in its relations with the member states .
a very important proposal indeed .
that should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report .
naturally i will not take up any more of the time of the house than is absolutely necessary .
financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform .
several members have made that point again in the course of today 's debate .
change in the law is fundamental .
that service will open on 1 may this year .
that is in line with the draft resolution .
i welcome parliament 's support for that .
that is most certainly relevant .
the debate is closed .
such is life .
i hope the house will understand that .
it is , of course , a peace process which is finally under way .
what can the european union do in these circumstances ?
unfortunately , very little .
we have enough agreements ; they just need to be implemented .
my third and last point concerns the role of the european union .
we really hope and believe so .
this has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a community framework .
the same is true with regard to immigration policy .
we hope that the council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this parliament .
we will do this today .
in this first speech , i would like to share with parliament the commission 's view of the most important events in 1999 .
this project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common union .
it is for the public , therefore , that we are developing the area of freedom , security and justice .
we want an area of freedom , security and justice for the citizens of europe , not against them .
mr president , i have nothing further to say to the council .
the first is asylum .
decisions on asylum should take months - not years .
on the other hand , quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life .
europe as an area of freedom , security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors .
we must take the best from each of our countries .
mr president , there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice .
and who is not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?
mr president , the treaty of amsterdam has set an important objective for the union .
the euro , employment , even security , are not enough .
the council and parliament must work together to provide the resources that the commission needs .
mr president , i welcome much , indeed most , of what has been said in this debate .
we must make sure that what we do makes clear sense .
thank you , minister .
the debate is closed .
i also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control .
question time ( council )
thank you for your answer .
however , i would just like to add the following .
that is our role and this is the point of my question .
thank you , mr president and thank you president-in-office of the council .
i should like to have an answer to that question .
the matter is still open .
this is not true .
as far as we are concerned , they will be .
i would like to thank mr president-in-office of the council .
today 's political statement on this issue was very positive indeed , and one which i welcome .
therefore , the responsibility of the european union has to be seen in a certain context .
i think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public .
there are two fundamental questions in particular .
i thank the president-in-office for his reply .
why should we do this ?
i cannot think of a better way to do it .
can you ?
mr president , i understand that i have to do this very quickly .
the next item is the joint debate on :
madam president , i do not have a great deal to add on this subject .
i consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons .
the measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today .
we need a framework of regulations at international level .
this has already been made clear a number times in this debate .
there is nothing so closed as a closed mind .
i have two or three points to make in this respect .
we all know that !
we can take action against this ; it is possible .
that is not always the case .
madam president , according to various members of your parliament , more funding should still be made available for major projects .
i thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate .
it is not your job , it is our job to decide on that .
i just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less .
the debate is closed .
( the minutes were approved )
agenda
the next item is the order of business .
( applause )
i shall now , therefore , put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote .
freedom , law , security and peace : this is what the european union was and what the european union is .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
we all took part in it , not just one group .
( applause )
let me thank you , madam president , for your contribution on behalf of parliament .
( applause )
and these are the consequences !
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
however , that is not the problem .
our answer to this crucial question is no .
( applause )
we must therefore find a political solution .
we must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned .
it is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened .
the union is not only an economic community but also a community of values , something which we take seriously . something has happened .
madam president , as everyone has said , this is a very important day . it is the day of the first debate of european political life .
( applause )
who would want this to happen ?
europe is a community of law .
( applause )
my final point is this .
we understand the context of this essential debate .
does the commission support the council ?
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
it is therefore political by nature .
mr president , commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .
so , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it .
if a political decision is involved , i would also like to ask : who takes this political decision ?
the commission ?
the council ?
and to what extent will the european parliament be able to play a role in this ?
what , also , will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up ?
these are my three questions .
this is part of risk management .
then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not .
it was raised quite recently in the environment council by a number of ministers who want the commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done .
the commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done .
i want to know whether this also applies in the document which the commission has presented now .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
intergovernmental conference
in the interests of the citizens , we must provide for greater transparency in the political process during the intergovernmental conference .
that it is what we are doing .
we will talk about this on another day .
they need a political deal .
there is time .
i thank the commission for doing that even if , of course , i do not agree with everything the commission said .
that is all to the good .
moreover , given that this opinion is quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be voting for it .
that is why we as a group are in favour of the intergovernmental conference .
that is why we need transparency .
there is another central issue relating to democracy that i would like to make clear reference to .
there is another point i would just like to draw your attention to .
it is not , however , possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union .
the other area of conflict is more difficult .
this time , however , it is true .
we want an intergovernmental conference , but not this one .
of course there must , but not this type of intergovernmental conference .
have we achieved results ?
i feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive , and i should like to thank you for taking it .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
there is no doubt that we need a legislative act here .
there is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account .
nevertheless , i have tabled an amendment .
legal security requires this .
for that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals .
why do i think we need the directive so much ?
the other amendments are unacceptable .
i will keep myself free in this connection .
the debate is closed .
since we are talking about the intergovernmental conference , let us consider just two points .
the first concerns this parliament .
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report .
however i also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here .
the european union is a system based on law .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is not our opinion .
i believe that is a good thing
the eu commission cannot pay for everything .
let us make this clear , however much some people may not wish to believe it .
what is to be done with this money ?
all of this needs to happen , and quickly too .
for example , amendments nos 1 , 2 and 4 .
commissioner , an agreement is an agreement .
the problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted .
what i proposed to you , and what i still say , is that the commission will make a statement , in the council decision , something like this :
i agree , absolutely . we shall do so .
the debate is closed .
we are all concerned about the environment and our children 's future .
i hope that you will all agree that this is important progress .
this was an important consideration for us .
we have an important part to play in the community in the european union in this regard .
it is something that we can all support .
we are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
culture 2000
it is also of great importance to citizens .
all that remains for me to say is : time to get down to business .
why do i say that culture is important ?
that is what culture 2000 is about .
are we doing enough ?
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , we have now come to the end of a long road .
such policies are necessary , and i would like to see them developed further .
thank you , commissioner .
i think we can also thank the rapporteur once again .
the debate is closed .
we therefore have a number of amendments .
this is my main concern in this matter .
we think they should .
may i say something about costs .
this means that we need a pressure instrument .
this parliament has been given more authority , so let us use it !
i ask for your support .
all the same , there is one point on which we are in conflict .
mr president , commissioner , i think we need this directive .
this is also an important point .
i would ask you to support this common position .
mr president , we need to take an important decision today .
we , the green group , by and large support the common position .
for ourselves , it is crucial that the following principles should apply .
mr president , i am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this parliament , as indeed it is for the citizens of europe .
our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests .
it is high time that we reached an agreement .
parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context .
we are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading .
these costs are not very high .
i do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise .
now who should pay the costs ?
we cannot accept this .
mr president , like so many others here today , i believe this is a good measure .
i cannot accept that .
i cannot accept it and i will not vote for it .
mr president , there are two issues of principle in the council 's draft directive .
mr president , commissioner , i have asked to speak again so that i can say a few more words at the close of this debate .
i do not think so .
we have reached an agreement with all the parties involved .
first of all : who should pay ?
the first question , then , is about who should pay .
no , of course not .
we can deal with it .
i naturally hope that the result of today 's vote will be a good one .
these amendments can all be approved .
they cannot therefore be approved .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
vote
it should not be in the amendment .

( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is very good , and we are pleased to see it .
the fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the european union .
in my opinion , this directive is unacceptable for this reason .
that is why i voted in favour of the amendments .
the directive remains in place .
that is why i am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .
so what was done at amsterdam ?
this is why i am voting against the report .
madam president , i had a major problem with this resolution .
this needs to be said !
they are wrong .
some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections .
the european parliament was the first to speak up .
it has no right to do so .
we must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results .
are there any comments ?
madam president , on a point of order .
madam president , on a point of order .
madam president , on a point of order .
i would ask you once again to work on this .
agenda
president .
we are in favour of the international criminal court , but it does not yet exist .
we believe that justice should be done in this case , but this is not the most appropriate procedure .
we already have a directive .
this is all i am talking about here , just that .
i understand that there is agreement on this issue .
quite , we agree absolutely .
the next item is the joint debate on the four following reports :
nevertheless , technical assistance is necessary .
for this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind .
this is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it .
nothing has happened !
that is a question of solidarity and progress .
he was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas .
five months are provided for this .
that seems to me to be rather too long .
the programme has been extremely successful in ireland , as indeed i know it has been successful in other countries .
this , unfortunately , is not the case in ireland .
comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another .
this is not the case !
i believe that this is actually a good thing .
that time is now past .
there is a problem , however , which we need to address together .
of course this is also the basic idea .
i hope that the commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making .
i believe that we should be pleased about this .
that is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers .
these people live in areas which should benefit from these projects .
i can understand your concern .
i agree completely .
i accept this ; i take note of it as you do .
so much for the first comment .
so we are working within this framework and not outside it .
and there will not be less funds available than in the current period either ; there will be more .
i now come to the content of the report .
we will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it .
i can only fully share your concern .
finally , i would like to mention technical assistance .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
( parliament approved the request )
they have our full support .
( applause )
agenda
these will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years .
finally , our last commitment is to improve quality of life .
we also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document .
we in the european union are one community .
( applause )
we need structural reforms in the european economy .
we support that .
( applause )
what we need here is good government , madam president .
i have absolutely no doubt about this and i believe it is an essential point .
we need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil society .
we need to open that debate .
that is the way it should be .
first let me speak about the economy and social development .
i support the enlargement of the european union .
what do we expect from a government in any case ?
even by this stage , that is already too many by far .
firstly , we need a successful european economy .
we must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes .
the commission is not in fact today a european government .
i myself want to refer to a subject which has not been mentioned but which is on the agenda , namely the commission 's work programme for 2000 .
however , parliament did ask for a legislative initiative six years ago .
so who is this then ?
the commission as a whole , its president perhaps , the council ?
have you already included your second term of office ?
but seriously .
( applause )
that is transparency .
( applause )
( applause )
this is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility .
in the union for a europe of nations group our principles are rather different .
clearly , they have no role to play in your strategy .
however , saying is one thing and doing is another !
recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential .
not a euro more or a euro less .
and do you know why ?
commissioner , far too little is said in your paper about regional policy .
economic and social cohesion in the eu is a fundamental task of this community .
then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it .
the serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme .
is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about ' who does what ' but more ' what are we doing together ' ?
our people expect more europe , but not just any europe .
on the other hand , what does this statement tell us about principles ?
after all , what is social justice if it is without full employment ?
this is a key priority for us to focus on .
madam president , mr president of the commission , i should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme .
culture and training simply do not exist in this paper , despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in europe .
just a few main points .
i am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture ; they create jobs .
there is nothing new in your work programme .
does that give me hope for the year 2000 ?
no , it does not !
no , you have not done so .
that is what we expect of you in the next five years .
this house has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second .
they want to see results .
certainly not !
i think the fact that the commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious .
you may draw your own conclusions .
on behalf of the house , i would like to welcome you to the european parliament .
mr president , i wanted to point out an important matter of principle .
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
as with all other community initiatives , this is very positive .
the aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility .
the eu should be prepared to meet that competition .
i therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this european union plan and for it to be further developed .
as far as we in the committee on agriculture and rural development are concerned , so far so good .
we have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the commission on the text .
as far the commission and the legal affairs committee are concerned , it comes under competition .
in other words , we shall be discussing other proposals here in parliament over the next few months .
however , more work is needed on this .
this proposal has no financial consequences for the community budget .
nevertheless , i should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
the commission proposal is , as some of you have said , rather technical .
five amendments have been presented by parliament .
i would simply point out that the commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection .
i should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate .
the text taken by parliament is from the directive which was adopted in 1998 .
it is before parliament for second reading .
there are just a few points i should like to make on that issue .
mr president , allow me to ask the commissioner one more question .
thank you , commissioner .
parliament has taken due note of your comments .
the debate is closed .
here again the commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by parliament .
and it is still on the agenda today .
i agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the environment committee has asked the committee on agriculture and rural development to agree to the commission proposal .
we have a new commission .
whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this commission and the president of the commission , only time will tell .
but you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this .
it is indeed .
you can see it in different countries .
it will be there for some time to come .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
community policy in the field of water
the majority of the amendments approved by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection meet these objectives . i hope they will be supported by this house .
the framework directive on water is a necessary initiative .
i want to refer to the political position here .
this is an opportunity for us to improve the situation .
measure after measure has come out of the environment committee .
mr president , the european parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the water directive .
and we can already see the consequences !
i would first of all like to focus on quality .
coordination is the key word here .
it is time for action .
the time for action is upon us .
we know that the commission proposal does not go far enough ; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the committee on the environment .
i understand this .
i see no reason why european union member states cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible .
this cannot be done , and it also , in any case , goes against nature .
the dialogue on europe - institutional reform
we want to encourage debate among the people .
that is all i have to say for the moment .
colleagues , you know the rules .
however , i believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people .
i do not think so .
this will therefore be our rule .
thank you , commissioner .
question time ( commission )
first part
i am sure the honourable member did not mean that .
are you aware of this ?
are you prepared to act upon it ?
this is my first additional question .
my question therefore is this : will the commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions ?
i understand your concern about the rights of children .
i know that the convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the commission has .
the commission is not a state . it cannot and must not act as if it were one .
i thank the commissioner for his reply to my question .
could the commissioner answer two questions .
we are not talking about words here .
the honourable member raised the question .
second part
thank you for your reply .
i hope that this will be of benefit .
- i do not quite understand what the commissioner said .
you say there will be no further funding .
if not , why not ?
is this right and proper ?
what is your opinion on that ?
the result may , of course , be some difficult questions of priorities .
the rules of procedure do not allow this .
-
this is all i can say .
however , things are really quite different .
my question to the commissioner is this : what is to be done ?
will it discuss the matter ?
what can the commission do about that ?
-
quite simply there is no question of this .
-
you may answer the question .
i have given you my answer .
having said this , we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the european union .
i am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the structural funds regulation .
this is all i can say today .
as far as i am concerned , all expenditure is real .
my position on this is clear .
thank you for your reply .
this may , of course , be seen as an issue concerning the internal market , but also as a public health matter for the whole eu .
the commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the european court of justice .
thank you very much , commissioner .
mr president , commissioner , this is a very important directive .
it is important not only for the environment but also for public health .
and there are more and more of us in the world .
we agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled , whose aim is to improve it .
this applies to every country .
mr president , commissioner , we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading .
the whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the eu .
this proposal can therefore be approved .
these amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found .
the proposal cannot therefore be approved .
. i accept that .
the debate is closed .
financial instrument for the environment ( life )
rapporteur .
there is no other such policy .
let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves ?
i would therefore ask parliament and the commission to give the matter their full attention .
where the question of the budget is concerned , i am pleased about the confidence shown by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
the debate is closed .
mr president , the issue of social security systems is an important one .
economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment .
this is good , but it is not enough .
all this is important .
these proposals favour women especially .
we expect the commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme .
i think this proposal is a good one .
finally , i want to say that the eu is not only concerned with cooperation on trade .
the eu is also a union for employment and social justice .
we hope that the council and the commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy .
but it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion .
the issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the european union are quite different from one another .
the majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen .
we now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets , which is a problem for many member states .
i am certain that most of them would vote for another party next time .
the reality is quite different .
i also welcome the commission 's communication .
that is not what we want to do in europe .
i would like to make a number of comments about what has been said .
i think the statement 's content makes this clear .
the debate is closed .
parliament cannot , in any case , at present do anything about the matter .
that would not be a good thing .
i think they should have .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur .
this is not provided for in the treaty of amsterdam .
what does the commission have to say to that ?
why does the commission say nothing about this ?
it is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account .
this is important .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
this new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the european union in this context .
firstly , we need to make the eu 's development policy more effective .
the third aspect that needs to be considered is european union policy and member states ' policy .
we improve the policy framework for trade and investment development .
let me turn to some of the more important points .
firstly the agreement on political issues .
negotiations will start no later than 2002 .
this is part of the solution .
this is also true of development cooperation .
this is where we want to go .
i have raised questions regarding this issue for years now .
but what have we seen since then ?
it is , therefore , with good reason that we bring this up here today .
what are we actually doing then ?
this is also at the request of the citizens .
what are the objectives which each eu policy needs to take into account ?
we say that we want to protect human rights .
we encourage developing countries to respect human rights .
is the council discussing this issue ?
mr president , this morning 's debate is very important .
above all , however , we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us .
this is particularly true of agricultural policy .
this is not new .
one of the major conclusions of this report concerned the european policy 's internal conflict .
in terms of trade and agriculture , in particular , the european policy is in conflict with the development policy .
we should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations , but as a policy in its own right .
mr president , commissioner , i believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense .
we have to be aware of this .
that is a fact of life .
take the trade agreements .
action simply has not been taken .
what could be the cause of this ?
i think that the commission could do a great deal there to help this develop .
special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production .
i know that we do a great deal of good , but let us start with this very essential aspect .
the first is concerned with conflict resolution .
the un has a peace plan .
why should we add to them ?
this discussion is not new .
finally , i thank you again for this debate .
the debate is closed .
the european union voted against that motion .
so what should we do ?
we have made our views very clear to them .
welcome
vote
the commission can also accept amendment no 4 in principle .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before the final vote :
that is the appropriate way of dealing with this .
( parliament decided to refer the report back to committee )
before the vote :
welcome
( parliament adopted the resolution )
thank you for your attention .
( parliament adopted the resolution ) president .
in my opinion , the most important amendments concern the following :
this is actually in conflict with european values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this parliament .
we think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report .
the commission did not do that .
particularly important issues are the following :
these are the main reasons for my vote .
i support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy .
we share them .
the policies of the european union also have much to answer for in this situation .
the same applies to labour market policy .
in order to make our actions effective , we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present .
i believe that this should be applied to all areas , in particular also the budgetary area .
the union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work .
nor is there freedom of information now .
dialogue is one way , but it is not enough .
we need to work .
what do they see ?
that is positive .
but what about the human rights policy within the eu itself ?
in fact , does the european union have a human rights policy ?
no , mr president , i am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the european union itself .
the commission and the council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be .
i do not know if he is still present and can hear me .
i wish to discuss two matters .
first of all , civil society .
and for ten years now , its parliament has been out of action .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
this is key as regards the future of this issue .
we need this instrument .
the commission is able to adopt some of them .
at the end of the day , it is the budgetary authority that must establish the final amount .
for our part , we have made funds available for this purpose in the new financial regulation .
as the commissioner said , and i agree with him , it is a matter of political decision .
as far as the citizens are concerned , it is what a regulation can do for them that matters .
decisions have been taken by the council with a great sense of responsibility .
i have had a little to do with this too .
these will take place at a later date .
indeed that was the idea behind it .
i cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place , because i lack the legal basis for doing so .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
the council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field .
this kind of situation should not be allowed .
however , we have to work within the existing legislative framework .
i do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that .
that was how it was .
but i have a quite different question for the council .
what do we have today ?
that , however , is not my question .
secondly , what does it propose to do about them ?
this issue is also under discussion .
both parties were once part of the government .
secondly , as there is no mention of structural funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in ?
it is extremely important .
that is my first question .
you are most welcome .
( applause )
( applause )
in other words , i was so obviously and naturally european that i did not even think about it .
i refer to the civil society .
thank you , mr president .
this i think is the new convention .
so i do not want to look back only to the year 1999 .
that is important , for at least three reasons .
i do not have very long in which to speak , and i really only want to take up two questions .
i do not agree .
once they have done so , we shall adopt a position on the matter .
this would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted amsterdam treaty .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
firstly , there is the regional approach .
and there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive .
with this in mind , we have presented some amendments which i hope parliament will accept .
this applies to them and us .
this is not the union 's only contribution .
will it do the same to us ?
this agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region .
that is why it is so important .
i think we should take a more positive approach here .
this requires internal stability .
but the country also - and especially - needs external stability .
but what then instead ?
i say this just so that we know where we stand .
the debate is closed .
i just have one more request .
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
here is a real step forward , in the new system that has been agreed .
we are to know who is on each committee .
we are to know when they meet .
so that is at least a step forward .
we adopt legislation in the european union .
we expect the commission to implement it .
here too there is at least some progress .
that , too , is a step forward .
the legislative authority , council and parliament , should be equal .
true , we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system .
not that we do so every week .
overall we have a system which has made some progress .
so it is a step forward .
so how far have we come ?
i think this is a good agreement .
the debate is closed .
we have already heard about the various aspects involved .
firstly , for the single market .
secondly , for economic and monetary union .
he has done really good work in a very short time .
that being so , i believe the final result will be better .
the debate is closed .
so what is the european union doing about it ?
so we come back to the previous problem .
i would also like to make a more general point .
but there has been nothing for a year .
we are also concerned with the question of cooperation .
that is , after all , a question the people often ask .
they will need time to get used to that too .
that is what this framework decision is about .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
they are very important in this case .
in this regard , too , the committee is prepared to go further than the commission .
there are different views on this .
the current situation is not good .
however , it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern .
we have achieved a compromise solution .
we have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this , or so we believe , which i welcome .
there is no freedom without rules .
not at all .
this is what we should be concerned about here today .
we must put an end to this .
the same cannot be said of the first proposal .
mr president , this is a vital issue for europe .
i shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment .
mr president , i see two problems with this morning 's debate .
firstly , i welcome proposal no 1 .
i think many of the british members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report .
if further regulation is needed , we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive .
we ask the commission to look again at these proposals .
we cannot , therefore , adopt the proposed amendment for this reason .
as far as the second proposal is concerned , i already mentioned that the commission will take into consideration many amendments .
the debate is closed .
i should like to draw attention to the fact that the council is not present today .
these are serious matters on which this house must act .
this is why this report is so important .
there are two reasons why we are saying no .
this issue is extremely serious .
how can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis ?
most say it is about time .
vote
note will be taken of it in the minutes .
i shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote .
'
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament approved the legislative resolution )
before the vote
madam president , you have said several times that this is a very serious problem .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we want to bring this across in parliament .
very well , i shall do so .
proposal for a joint resolution on human rights
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
there is still much to be done , however .
we thank you for that .
thank you very much commissioner .
thank you for your statement .
the subject in question is of great political and social importance .
why should this be the case ?
i do hope that this will not be necessary .
everything has already been said on this subject .
take a large successful business , add european regulations , and within months you have created a small one .
we must therefore act .
that is my conclusion today .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
human rights
the other reason is that this text does not , unfortunately , go very far .
why not ?
there is no reason for them to be there .
we need to be able to go back with a proper answer .
it would be the first in a long time .
so i welcome it as such .
yet this is not the situation .
it is we , our own people , who keep the war going over there .
so we need to do this .
it is important to point this out .
we have just approved the water directive here in parliament .
this is not the case here .
what are we doing about it ?
this is a subject which is not given sufficient attention .
the debate is closed .
i would be in favour of its doing so .
it must form the basis for our partners ' political will .
who is going to pay ?
several members have set out what seems to have happened .
the debate is closed .
vote
, rapporteur .
the commission and parliament are called upon to answer two questions : what are the right conditions and what is the role of the european union on this ?
mr president , there are three points i wish to address .
this could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs .
let us look at some of these reasons .
i hope you will help us .
since then , however , there has been no progress .
why is it so important in that sector ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
however , such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy .
i am therefore voting against the proposal .
perhaps we can discuss this later on .
that has only happened recently .
for over a year the old commission could have done some work on this .
it is for life .
this should first of all stand for better service .
as far as i know , that has still not happened .
i would therefore ask you , commissioner , to help me in my task as a new member .
we do not think so .
our answer is clear : it is not the commission nor even the council or the european parliament , but the people of each member state by democratic procedures .
" what has become of it ?
"
so be it .
i come from a rural area .
he does not need a government to do so , or a parliament , nor does he need a commission to do so !
that is the measure of the problem .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
president .
statement by the president
"
'
this , madam president , is the only way forward which we therefore fully support .
let us make ourselves heard !
are there any comments ?
but we shall have a decision very soon .
( the minutes were adopted )
the second point is human resources .
all this has to change , and this is one of the main reasons for our reform .
these are the areas in which changes will be made .
that is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the commission want to provide and will provide .
we shall now move on to question time .
the second point that i want to make concerns information technology .
i would like everything to happen much more quickly .
we will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first .
two questions if i may .
two other points i must make , because this is an essential question central to reform .
my question is this : there is a need for reform , due not least to the accession of new countries , and thus to the enlargement of the union .
sometimes we may feel that too much has happened .
i will set this out in five points .
how can we do this ?
i have two further points to make on this process .
i am not going to say much more on these issues .
yet there is one positive point which i must share with you .
these are the only positive aspects which i can tell you about at the moment .
commissioner , would you like to speak now or a little later ?
we know that you have an important role in this .
but what about kosovo in the year 2000 ?
he is not always right , but in this case he is .
from the beginning , he wanted this war in order to become president .
so that is the world as it is today .
for that reason i say to you : my group is not entirely in agreement , but i am in favour of european defence .
let us just consider for a moment .
we also have several questions to ask you that show our concern , that is the least one can say .
i can already hear your reply : humanitarian standards .
not to make war , of course , but to protect peace .
we all very much share this opinion .
i would like to hear your opinion . do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the member states in this respect ?
for my part , i do not wish to give up hope .
can you tell us your position on this subject ?
the decision to set up our own peace force is excellent .
this too is unacceptable in my view .
at the moment , europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of .
actually , i hear less and less about this .
but is there not more to it than that ?
is this actually how we want things done ?
will they also take part in our defence policy ?
do you think that any of these issues could be included , at least in the agenda of the current conference ?
i will give you an example .
this has not just happened .
secondly , what will happen to the european defence industry which , after all , comes under the more general activities relating to this system ?
will current programmes continue to be implemented ?
has it been discussed ?
could you at last bring about change in this respect ?
but let me start with the first .
that question has been put by many members of the parliament .
it is very important .
they exist already .
but let me also tell you something .
we are trying very hard , but it is very difficult to do this .
that help will be needed .
how far will foreign policy be brought under the community framework in the coming years ?
we were the only group of countries that took a decision like that .
i would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject .
all those things come together .
what we need , therefore , is to promote specific policies .
( applause )
if need be , we must use all possible means to force the situation .
( applause )
i must also thank the commissioner for being here and for her words .
some members have even come out against this .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner and the president-in-office of the council .
unfortunately , they have made little effort in this regard as well .
that is absolutely crucial .
there are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which i should just like to mention here finally .
do we have a special problem in this regard ?
the second point is the enlargement of the union .
women have different individual needs and interests .
that is unacceptable in a democracy .
but we should draw the necessary conclusions from this .
and how should we achieve this ?
we all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary .
this is the reality of the situation .
this is one problem .
three comments : the first is based on the fact that women are able . i can , therefore all women can .
because they have a different level of education .
not necessary !
there is not one party , from the far left to the far right , which does not stress the need for women to take part .
on paper !
on this we are clear .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .
let me turn to the assistance provided so far .
the debate is closed .
union economy ( 1999 )
why should this be so ? is it down to the european central bank ?
this does not just have to do with the fact that there is still a lack of structural reform .
this is the objective , in respect of which he called upon the european parliament : give hope to the people of europe .
it will be voting against it .
member states , in particular , should adopt an effective policy .
europe 's major problem is still unemployment .
it cannot continue like that .
the real world simply does not work like that .
the commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem .
we need public and private investment .
what policy should we use to achieve these objectives ?
common fisheries policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the committee .
first , in respect to economic data , amendment no 2 makes two changes .
i agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the commission .
one thing is certain : there will be no common fisheries policy if it is not based on a common data support framework .
the debate is closed .
for the others , well , we would have time to see what would happen , according to local circumstances .
i think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way .
what about women ?
we are a long way off having this under control .
so it also has to do with environmental protection .
the protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health .
this is in particular the case for amendments nos 3 and 5 .
i therefore am not able to accept amendment no 4 .
the debate is closed .
the common fisheries policy is not working .
the debate is closed .
this is the basis of my request to the european commission and the services of this house .
these initiatives , together with effective systems of control , are the key aspects for the future of fisheries .
but that is nothing new .
the debate is closed .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
ladies and gentlemen , i would ask you to come and take part in this discussion .
and just as well , in my view .
given this context , i would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago .
can i first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , one thing must be made clear , to my mind : it is the task of our common fisheries policy to guarantee sustainable fisheries management .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i think we all agree that a european legal area must be created .
today , in many member states , that is not possible .
on the other hand , it does not accept amendment no 4 .
the debate is closed .
i wish to put two questions to the commissioner .
what is the commission 's view of these proposals ?
what decisions has the commission already taken and what decisions does it plan to take ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , thank you all very much for the commitment you have shown in the discussion we have been having .
these three proposals are quite specific .
this is the right way to go .
the debate is closed .
we agree with the commission on this .
he said that this issue was not on the agenda as this only concerned political issues .
it is , in fact , an international agreement and a trade agreement .
there is i think one final reason why the commission should be supported .
the commission must guarantee that these things will be done .
what should our policy be ? i will start at the end and work back .
the debate is closed .
vote
thank you very much .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
paragraph 3 :
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
president .
all the members of our group voted in favour of these amendments , both in committee and in parliament .
we look forward to that .
we need a completely different system .
some measures , particularly on tax , must be adopted to encourage private and public investment .
everyone must play their own part .
our summit will therefore be on sustainable development and employment .
a basis for all this is created through education and training , and research , however .
i believe this is important .
i believe that this is important .
( applause )
i too would like to welcome the fact that you have come to this house to dialogue with us before you go to your summit meeting .
we would like to believe this , but we cannot .
why ?
we know all of this .
it is our opinion that it is not only necessary to change this state of affairs , but that it is also possible to do so .
my first question , which is a very direct one , is about an institutional issue which we now have the opportunity to discuss with you for the first time as president-in-office of the european council .
that is my first question .
my second question is about the employment summit .
i congratulate you , mr president-in-office .
this is a very serious risk .
in europe , everyone should be able to keep up .
and if so , what measures does the council presidency have in mind ?
my main question relating to this is , what is actually new ?
what is new , of course , is social protection .
this should not happen .
i am not making the case against stability policies nor against necessary structural reforms .
why ?
we now need to ask ourselves why this is the case .
why ?
there are other areas that we must look at .
that must be right .
we cannot just focus on the new economy . we must pay attention to the old .
the aim of full employment cannot be achieved by economic policy alone .
we are a long way from it today .
it is thus up to you to create them .
this is not your objective .
but we cannot stop there .
it is up to each and every one of us to work on this .
europe needs to achieve full employment .
i hope that it does just that !
i would like to draw your attention to three specific points .
so i would ask that this point be given due attention too .
the fact that parliament has a crucial role to play in this is also important .
obviously , in order to achieve this , there are two issues which are crucial in all areas .
, commission .
therefore , our responsibility is both economic and social .
the debate is closed .
there are three reasons for this .
rapporteur .
in this context , aid can play an important role .
this question will then , at all events , return to parliament .
i hope that the vote will ensure that this will also become parliament 's proposal .
might i just ask for one more thing ?
here too , education and training measures need to be supported in order , in the end , to help people to help themselves .
the content of the regulation must therefore be supported in full , although the budget proposed by the council is not sufficient by far .
but why not ?
to do this , sufficient financial support is of course necessary .
given that most projects are already under eur 2 million this amendment is considered not relevant .
therefore the commission does not support it .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
our services say that it is possible to do so then .
there is another report first .
president .
we will start again .
thank you for that .
but we also all know only too well that not all projects are as successful as we would like them to be .
the debate is closed .
not only that .
i will only have positive things to say to the commission about the quality of the directive .
experience and scientific research has shown that this seems to work .
we are after all at one with the council on three points .
they must therefore be provided .
we agree on these points .
that means that we want to have an effective system .
we are prepared to reach an agreement with the council .
nothing would change .
this is very important .
this is good for the environment .
as such , this directive is already coming into effect in a sense .
i would like to say that we have made some progress here .
i believe that the work we are discussing today is a great step forward .
many thanks , mr president .
the debate is closed .
i do not believe that this is necessary here .
that would not make any sense .
so , put amendment no 3 to the vote first .
mr president , everything has been said .
but he has said what this is all about .
i welcome this initiative and i hope it can be put into effect as soon as possible .
road safety is a serious matter .
the debate is closed .
agenda
the priority in terms of consumer rights is the safety of products and services .
therefore , in future , we should think of something different .
however , we have some concerns about the process .
this would not be too serious if significant progress had been made during the five previous years , but this is not the case .
indeed , in terms of social policy , the commission and parliament have the opportunity to promote many things .
let me give one example of this .
this proposal has already been put forward several times , but has never been tabled .
this cannot be said of many of the other member states .
in conclusion , can i say that i am very pleased that the president has , this morning , referred to fisheries .
we were to be able to have access to any document , once the commission had given it to others .
relations with russia are of vital importance .
i should now like to make a few comments on economic and social matters .
the areas in question are environmental policy , consumer protection and health policy .
a lot of other people have also said that here today .
but what is the situation now ?
two : the internal market .
i would like you to comment on this , mr president of the commission .
what has the reform of the commission to do with the internal market ?
the answer is a lot .
how can this be ?
i will start with trade .
it is essential .
! !
we welcome that !
go for it !
we must take action and the example should come from above .
in fact we have not had a legislative programme for several years now .
but does that mean that we have done the job in terms of legislation in the social area ?
i think not .
there are other areas .
why not ?
mr president , mr president of the commission , you should look to the right !
that is a very good example , but what happened to the other five ?
one out of six is simply not good enough .
in addition , it is vital for parliament and the commission to work well together to make these decisions .
i am fully aware of this .
and in order to do this we must work together .
i feel that this is an extremely important strategy .
unfortunately , i did not receive any answer to this question .
no , not this time either !
the president of the commission has given his answer and we must now continue the debate .
the debate is closed .
the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection has , however , adopted two important amendments .
i welcome these even though , in my opinion , they do not go far enough .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i feel that this is an approach which is in line with what we voted on two years ago .
the discussion was not without results either .
we wanted the commission to draft an amendment proposal , if need be .
we believe that this is good for consumers .
there are , of course , other interests which need to be taken into consideration .
we therefore support the common position and believe that the directive should be adopted as soon as possible .
i therefore call upon you to support all the amendments presented by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
what then ?
it must ensure the quality of food products and consumer health .
but is this actually true ?
i will start with the information for the consumer .
this seems to be unacceptable to me .
which is it and which will it be ?
i have no doubt that this compromise will help the overall market increase .
however , since that is no longer possible , i think that the common position is acceptable .
the same cannot be said for this directive which we had absolutely no need of .
this is what we achieved in the european parliament at first reading .
so what is to be done ?
welcome
where is the benefit in that for the third world ?
we may agree with something or we may not .
vote
this system seems a fair one to me , and i therefore voted in favour of it .
we are not one people .
this is not the case at all .
specific women 's rights do not exist .
to this end , i should like to stress two points .
we want more than this .
my second point is to do with its content .
there are , however , two points that i would like to mention here .
why ?
this is extremely important to my mind .
i therefore welcome it .
this question was raised in that document too .
there is however one risk .
many citizens do not know the rights that exist today .
however , it is clear that not all rights will be equal , at least in the way they are implemented .
in my view , there has not to date been so much discussion on the subject .
it cannot and must not be without this reference .
for this reason , we are against it .
i have tabled an amendment to this effect on behalf of my group .
with all due respect for the human rights convention , we need more !
let us support them in this .
this is not the case , and that is not the purpose of all this .
this is a real problem and one of which we should all be aware .
this is a fundamental question .
how far is the union prepared to go ?
on this subject , i should like to mention the issue of the intergovernmental conference .
once again , the commission would like to make four key points quite clear to parliament .
i would also like to clearly state a second idea .
this was one of them .
this is the first principle .
that is the second principle .
thank you very much , commissioner , for your comments .
could you comment on this ?
i have three specific questions that i would like to ask you :
thank you , commissioner , for your statement .
this is why i would like to direct two specific questions to the commissioner .
question time ( commission )
first part
mr president , i would first of all like to thank the commission for its reply .
i should like to thank the commissioner for his answer .
commissioner , thank you for your answer .
now it is up to me who i believe .
that is the state of play at the present time .
what more specific comments can he make about which sectors and which products will be concerned , and for how long ?
these are matters to which we shall no doubt return .
but that is something that only we need concern ourselves with .
thank you very much for that reply .
i would ask you what you think we could do together to promote this type of action .
this is a good question .
that is the first reason .
it is not quite over yet .
secondly , these are two completely different questions .
i actually referred to this at the beginning of my answer .
you mentioned the council .
there is little point in doing that in our view .
we can only apply existing community law in such cases .
we are right , therefore , to ask questions about the future .
i should also like to put a following question to the commissioner .
thank you very much , commissioner .
our approach should be different .
we are therefore able to accept these amendments .
the commission is able to support this amendment , too .
that was the first point .
thank you , commissioner , for your contribution .
i should like to say that i think this is completely unacceptable .
moreover , there are also some good resources which are being put to use .
this is a common commitment and a common responsibility .
mr president , commissioner , firstly i would like to thank the rapporteur for his work .
we cannot say that it is all wrong .
we have to expect that it will take time to implement this report .
if we do not , we will very soon find ourselves back with this problem again .
and this is important and necessary .
this amendment cannot , however , be adopted by the commission .
i think there are two crucial points here .
amendment no 12 can be approved in principle .
mr president , commissioner , firstly i too would like to thank the rapporteur .
i will support it tomorrow in the vote and i hope that the majority of the house will do the same .
mr president , commissioner , i have , of course , nothing against the principle of the directive .
it is an important instrument for future environmental policy .
a small country is not in a position to do this .
i shall give you an example .
i think that this is a good strategy .
nevertheless , i must ask a question here .
let me now turn to the amendments .
the commission cannot accept amendment no 10 .
the debate is closed .
environmental legislation
what will happen with projects which are already under way and what will happen , above all , in those cases where a region does not receive any money from the structural fund ?
i would ask that we make this point absolutely clear here .
our question to you , commissioner , has another purpose .
many member states , including my own , did not do as required .
but what does it matter ? !
and how could it be ?
if that were the case , then there would also be areas and matters which you and i would not like .
you must do it !
i wish her well .
in fact , it is a position in which i too find myself to some extent .
just how much must member states do to meet her requirements ?
the structural funds regulation has been approved by the member states and the council .
but let us be clear .
that was not at all clear .
let me say two or three things .
firstly , i think that community law must be seen as a whole .
you should do that !
the process brought the following problems to light in particular .
without any doubt , this cannot be in the interests of the commission .
citizens have the right to know the consequences which they can expect .
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to make a few final comments .
that is what this is about .
that is the decision we have taken today .
the debate is closed .
but more responsible human rights policies need to start at home .
however welcome some of these developments may be , more needs to be done .
this demand has also been put forward here today .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
we need increased coordination , not just between the institutions of the eu , but also between the eu and the member states .
obviously we need to deal with this .
but so too must the present member states .
technology is developing and so too , therefore , must our instruments for the protection of human rights .
i hope very much that the report will get a large majority when it is voted on later .
the commission needs this aid .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i think these reports speak for themselves .
for example , the right to immigration does not exist .
and where does the right to life come in ?
( applause from the right )
we have several basic principles .
animals have rights , children do not .
we have problems in the candidate countries .
we have to bring children up the agenda .
why can we not do the same ?
why can we not do the same ?
mr president , why are human rights so far behind human progress ?
this really is a case of fundamental rights .
mr president , this debate is taking place at an important moment for this parliament .
this year is especially significant .
i want to make three small points .
i would like to draw the house 's attention to three key points concerning human rights as i see this issue at present .
in this sense , thank you .
the institutions of the community and member states must lead the way in this .
it is something we have a great responsibility to do something about .
i want to say to my government that we must do the same at home in ireland .
these ladies and gentlemen are never present in committee .
technical work , no thank you .
( applause )
to ask the question is to answer it .
that is certainly what we , on this side of the house , believe .
is that what we want ?
i do not think it is .
more and more , we need to follow our words with actions .
what we need is a common european asylum and immigration policy based on european humanitarian values .
vote
as rapporteur , i obviously support the amendments of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
after the vote :
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we can therefore point these out at the appropriate moment .
thank you . everyone is now clear on this .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i will therefore put this to the house .
we do not in fact yet know whether we will be voting on this motion this morning as i was going to put this to the house .
we should keep to what was decided .
( the president put the proposal to the house which decided to end voting time )
we will make a note of this .
however , these amendments were not adopted , unfortunately .
i believe that we should not even have become involved in this directive .
we must demand the following :
now that would be real progress .
but this is not a question of health or environmental protection .
the answer is clearly no .
the new directive does not meet any of the relevant needs .
so why change it ?
will this at least increase the level of requirements and quality for all member states ?
not at all .
i therefore raised my concerns and questions at first reading .
this report is now before us at second reading .
the aim of these proposals is to improve air quality and protect human health .
we just need to make sure that it is used .
my colleagues should also note another point , although this is of less importance .
in principle i can only agree with these proposals .
i feel this is a good compromise .
for all these reasons we will vote against the joint motion .
this requires the creation of jobs , not just any jobs , but quality jobs , particularly in the service sector .
and rightly so .
i believe it has a place here .
very few of us wanted to stand up and say anything at the time .
allow me to tell you which points we do not accept and why .
i consider this last point to be very important .
i will now begin my own , madam president .
not only the european commission but also this parliament would do well to pay a lot more attention to this .
as far as i am concerned , this too is a key word .
this needs to be given special attention .
however , where there is political responsibility this should not be a problem .
all four reports on which we shall be voting are good reports .
but we must help them with training .
that simply is not true .
that is quite clear .
i therefore share the rapporteur 's and parliament 's concerns .
parliament has a key role to play in this regard .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
and we have given our reasons .
that too was a very positive aspect .
it comes down to how this system is seen under the rule of law .
and believe me , we shall do so .
i am not sure that this has really been done .
mr president , we are beginning to establish a common asylum and immigration law in europe .
that is the task now before the council .
the commission , in this case , has a different position from both the council and parliament .
we will come to parliament and the council with proposals in the next few months .
but there is a point where the commission does not agree with the council .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
however , here too we said that we wanted to help out .
i hope that the commission is able to accept this amendment .
i was very pleased to hear him say that there is no real conflict on the principles and objectives of the proposed directive .
these are already , of course , implemented by many other states .
on that basis , i believe that this proposed directive is wrong and i will be voting against it .
it makes no sense to continue with the debate .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the relevant committee will continue the discussion of this issue .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
is this a question of new competition between the european institutions and the national states ?
here in the european parliament , people speak , not parties .
first of all , there is no council decision .
this is not a european union issue .
and whether we like it or not , that is a fact .
do you not think that this is rather difficult for the european citizens to understand ?
thank you , minister .
why ?
i consider the reply by the president-in-office to be unacceptable .
does the council agree that state aid is important to promote european culture ?
we are also concerned about this .
the current presidency has been following this practice .
would you accept that principle ?
it seems as if we will not get through any more than that today either .
i am sure this is of interest to a number of members and there will be a few members who want to look at it .
anything but , in my view .
all in all , our group will vote in favour of this trade agreement , which we welcome .
the second is scientific and technical cooperation .
this agreement is based on human rights and democratic principles .
the debate is closed .
information society for all
commissioner , there are great opportunities here , but they must reach all the people .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , rapporteur , allow me to thank you for the open debate and , of course , the report .
these are two different things .
the amount is much too small .
how do we measure it ?
one such example is , of course , the area of education .
secondly : how will our working life and employment relations change ?
greater account needs to be taken of this .
that is a task for the council , parliament and the commission .
i wish us all a great deal of success in the interests of our citizens .
mr president , commissioner , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the successful work that has been done in so short a period of time .
an information society for all is certainly an area of focus for the commissioner in this process .
it is important , and i thank her for it .
how can we create new markets ?
we welcome the contribution of parliament to this very important policy debate .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
vote
( parliament agreed to the request )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i was not sure , so we should refer it to the rules committee .
the commission has not expressed its opinion on that .
i am not going to debate it .
however , i wanted to point this out .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , i should like to make a point of order .
this is not a legislative report .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i understand what is being asked here .
the members have already left !
even the rapporteur does not want that .
that is quite in order .
two specific points .
mr president , perhaps i can be of help here .
that is my motion .
there is absolutely no problem with that .
for that reason alone , we do not think that fundamental rights should be on the agenda of the current intergovernmental conference .
the union is , and should remain , a union of states .
we are therefore voting against the whole report .
these people need a document to which they can refer when they take their case before the european court of justice .
our demands are quite clear .
the treaty of amsterdam has made respect for human rights one of the main objectives of the eu 's common foreign and security policy .
the european union has many instruments available in this field .
obviously i agree with that .
i therefore believe that these points should have been left out of the human rights report .
and why not ?
the human being not only needs to be given the means to live , but also , and above all , he needs the reasons to live .
that is why we support the motion for a resolution .
direct dialogue between the parties is essential .
much has been said , but little has actually been done .
the commission must set up a financial safety fund for the next three months .
the debate is closed .
it was not the commission which was responsible for this , but the governments .
the debate is closed .
human rights
situation in iraq
on the situation in iraq .
what we need is the international criminal court and we must bring those responsible to justice .
but we have already said that .
situation in iraq :
it cannot continue .
we have to support all available initiatives .
we must find a solution .
this is why i welcome the debate on this conflict today .
very often , the people who actually live there are not taken into account .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
we should not support any of the proposals that have been made .
the debate is closed .
if there is no motion to vote on , then obviously no vote can then be held .
thank you .
we are not therefore voting on it .
( parliament approved the motion for a resolution )
i would ask for this to be considered .
we could have done it much more quickly because the position has been quite clear .
( parliament approved the motion for a resolution )
( parliament approved the motion for a resolution )
i consider that unacceptable .
( applause )
for there is indeed a strong risk that people will simply become used to the situation .
for those reasons , our vote is in favour of the report .
but that was not to be .
this is not serious .
i have not proposed what might be called a political resolution to my colleagues .
what is the legal basis for today 's debate ?
before an answer can be given , the following questions at least must be considered :
that is reason enough for us to vote against this text .
why ?
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
some people may not like the fact that the technical group has been set up , but it has been .
people have rights and i do not think that the comment that was made yesterday was acceptable .
that will not be a problem .
mr president , i do not have any comment to make on the minutes , but i do want to say something about the european parliament 's information services .
i would ask the parliamentary services to look into why it was left out .
( the minutes were approved )
vote
that is why we believe that parliament 's amendments improve the text .
mr president , that is all i have to say .
i would also like the european commission , in one way or another , to take account of parliament 's criteria .
we hope that this amendment will be adopted .
mr president , i welcome this measure .
it is important that we apply as many resources as possible to this .
now i would like to speak about parliament 's proposed amendments .
the purpose of this regulation is not to offer farmers any special services .
the resources available would not be sufficient for that either .
the commission is prepared , however , to adopt this amendment .
amendment no 10 concerns article 5 .
as we know , parliament is a budgetary authority together with the council .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
however , this has still not been done .
what are the conclusions of the commission 's report ?
this is a reference to amendment no 2 .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the rules as they stand allow this to happen .
i turn to the question at hand .
it is right that we have a proper discussion on the whole question of the structural funds .
what are they actually trying to achieve ?
is it therefore parliament 's role now to change that ?
we should not change that .
so where did the structural funds go ?
that is simply unacceptable .
but structural funds also provide an opportunity for national governments .
so what can we do ?
this is clearly not acceptable .
we have no objective 1 funding .
so , why do i speak ?
why not ?
commissioner : three questions :
the debate is closed .
statement by the president
we feel that these actions taken by turkey against members of parliament are cause for very serious concern .
we do still have two of them , though .
welcome
( applause )
agenda
the next item is the order of business .
it is your right as a member of parliament .
the item is on the agenda of our next committee meeting .
madam president , i should like to speak in support of this motion .
madam president , commissioner , i wish to congratulate the commission on this initiative , which i believe to be extremely important .
i have quite a few questions .
but if member states are in a position to do that earlier , so be it and so much the better .
i have a second question for you .
my second point , commissioner , regards application in 2001 .
this must be an issue of great concern to the commissioner .
i would like to know what the commission is doing about this .
mr president , i look forward with great interest to the commissioner 's reply to this debate .
or would they ?
as is clear , the regulation was adopted in order to protect the environment and the public .
that is all we know for sure .
i hope that , between us all , we can reach this agreement .
that is the only reason .
i welcome that and i congratulate you .
that much is clear .
they have given it to us so often .
yesterday we had a talk with the american minister for transport .
i think that we should begin with a legislative procedure at the end of the year .
it was voted through the last parliament without any debate .
i fully support the necessary standards to protect the health and quality of life for our citizens .
there are regulations , we put them in place .
they are good regulations .
that is what we would like to see you come back with at some time in the future .
it is essential as far as public health is concerned .
we must go further .
there is nothing more to say about this .
that is all . thank you very much , mr president .
the vote will be taken tomorrow .
the first is a general consideration .
this is a general political concern .
the second point is more specific .
i hope i have been clear .
therefore , mr president , much work still remains to be done .
a further meeting is due to be held here in brussels in the next few days .
for some reason or other , these agreements have not been implemented .
it is not the case , and it is something we have to change , and that means parliament , as well as the commission or the council .
for example , i have a problem with the conclusions they have based their questions on .
i hope that this parliament will support it .
we still have no date for a start to negotiations .
it would be good if the representatives of the commission and the council present here today could answer this question .
the debate is closed .
i believe this is important and i would like an answer from the council .
i believe that there are some people that we should not even speak to on principle .
there is a third problem : how are we going to pay for them ?
these are the things our member states should be doing .
this is not the only problem , however .
let us look at the situation in iraq .
why does the european union need a common asylum policy ?
i am going to talk about asylum .
what conclusions can we draw from this report ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
2001 budgetary guidelines
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports on the 2001 budgetary guidelines :
allow me to make myself quite clear .
as far as the other institutions are concerned , i only have a few comments to make .
that is the view of this parliament .
mr president , firstly i would like to thank the committee on budgets for their excellent cooperation .
we must not carry on this way .
this , for us , is the crucial approach .
let there be investment , then , in a culture of initiative .
however , these guidelines are not just about enlargement they are about policy direction for all the institutions next year .
only the vital areas can receive public funding .
i am all in favour of this .
why ?
we cannot go on like this .
there is another important point in this budget .
it concerns civil dialogue .
europe needs to set the framework , which is one of the reasons it created the treaty of amsterdam .
that cannot be .
we can work together .
you should know that .
this is a very serious commitment .
this morning we discussed environmental protection .
then it was said that environmental protection took priority .
i would be pleased to see new initiatives in this area .
what do we want , what objectives do we want to achieve or support with this budget ?
i should like to comment on your question as to how great an effect the european budget has on employment .
i should perhaps come back to the budgetary procedure for the budgetary year 2000 .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the motion for a resolution which has been tabled takes account of this fact .
this applies not only to our children but to all children .
we need a common approach in the european union and in the member states , in cooperation with the third countries in question .
i wish to point out that parliament has already adopted resolutions on this subject .
much more effective measures are required .
it is an extremely serious problem .
i find that cause for extremely serious concern .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is a very good idea .
may i also thank the other members of this house for their comments and questions .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the directive which is currently being prepared should , in my opinion , have two objectives .
we have many reasons to move in this direction .
firstly , the protection of the environment , but also the creation of jobs .
but , on balance , everyone is in favour .
we certainly have no lack of reports .
what we need now are initiatives to implement our decisions .
how can we do this ?
if we are serious about this , we must be prepared to make funds available for research and development in this area , both at national and european levels .
i hope that the commission will take note of these points .
what can we do about it ?
i also think that research and development in this area need greater support .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i want to stress two points .
i have never said that .
of course i am in favour of the enlargement of the european union to the east .
are there any further comments ?
he did not say that .
absolutely .
( the minutes were approved )
madam president , this is not about the minutes but about a point of order .
will it be made public ?
this is not a lack of transparency .
it is not up to me to do it .
mr president , the commission has taken note of the recent debate with concern .
let me now turn to data protection .
so what is to be done , then ?
not a single word .
that is something , at least .
is the british government being open about it ?
i think we have a right to know .
where is this taking us ?
our main priority should be to take a close look at the consequences it will have in terms of policy .
i therefore have three questions .
i should like to quickly make the following points .
i did do so and i do so again .
president , can i first thank parliament for the discussion .
i think this decision is very clear .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is the reason why i am here today .
the group of the european people 's party has therefore tabled amendment no 4 in order once again to make it clear that we are not going back on this .
why do i mention this ?
of course , i would like to add that that is something which is of serious concern .
i agree with him .
i think that the directive is a good one .
we are working on that .
not so .
vote
the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities has tabled a special opinion .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
concerning amendments nos 4 and 5 :
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
concerning amendment no 4 :
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
the committee on fisheries does not want more money .
the report is also a good text in that respect .
at present , it seems that animals have more rights than children in europe .
progress is , of course , being made .
that is unfortunately not the case .
)
where will it end ?
i believe it was very important for this house .
madam president , i should like to draw your attention to an internal matter .
i would hope that happened in the european parliament .
( applause from the left )
thank you .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , considerable changes have been made to the proposed agenda .
we shall do so .
agenda
we have no means to force the council to make a statement .
is this what you propose ?
i would rather keep to the order in which the proposals were received .
thank you for that .
it is up to the house to decide .
i think we are all in agreement .
i do not think that would be a problem .
these children are in particular need of society 's protection .
the eu has already taken several measures towards this , which i will not go into any further here .
that , ladies and gentlemen , is what i wanted to say .
this is a good reason to take action against this as a union .
this is a problem .
for this is not only an issue within the eu .
it cannot be set high enough .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
firstly , no consideration is given to the financial regulation .
i agree .
we shall here mention only three points .
those are three different areas of work .
the member states have a major role to play in this respect and must make considerable efforts .
finally , with regard to the amendments for cooperation with candidate countries , i think we must be quite clear on this .
the debate is closed .
i made a compromise proposal which , unfortunately , was not accepted in my political group .
we therefore welcome the directive .
what are we talking about here ?
this must change !
this does not make sense .
we want those rules .
in respect of the commission proposal , which parliament approved at first reading without amendments , the council has now made amendments to its common position which we do not wish to support .
europe and the internal market can only exist if they are also accepted by the citizens and the consumers .
such is life !
already at first reading , parliament fully supported the commission 's proposal .
what is being proposed today ?
i shall mention them quickly .
i would like to add the following if you will allow me .
mr president , naturally we too wish to congratulate our colleagues .
at the end of the line it is for the consumer that this is being done .
what are we discussing here ?
our proposal is based on three main principles .
for these reasons the commission is not in a position to accept amendments nos 3 , 4 and 5 .
therefore , the commission is not in favour of the first amendment .
there is something to be said for what you say in relation to this .
are there any comments ?
( applause from the left )
he should be quite clear about that procedure within our group .
( the minutes were approved )
mr president , on a point of order .
it concerns a reference made yesterday by the president on the change of business which is taking place this week .
( applause from the right )
vote on request for urgent procedure
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we have a number of difficult decisions to take this week .
the commission and parliament must work together and must create greater transparency in relation to the budget and its implementation .
where the general rate is 5 % , as already mentioned , that for agriculture is 3 % .
there has since been an increase in expenditure for development within rural areas but i will come back to this .
now that the treaty of amsterdam is in force , this situation is no longer acceptable .
i think that is about all i need to say .
has the commission ever taken legal action ?
we at the committee on development and cooperation have every confidence that we can bring about this reform thanks to the agreements we have reached with the commission .
the commission is called on in the report adopted by the committee on budgetary control to answer various questions or take direct action by 15 may .
i shall fight for clear rules within the framework of the financial regulation .
i should like to make the following comments on the proposed amendments .
we are working on that .
we shall have to debate this .
we would like to thank the rapporteur for her cooperation on that .
there has been a great deal of talk about a report on political group expenditure .
the fact is that our committee has not seen this report .
the important reports , of course , will come next .
it is important that we find a new way of doing it .
thank you , mr president , for all your kind support over the years for the budgetary control committee .
this is an extremely political issue .
it is not enough to say that it should come down .
this is what it is all about at the end of the day .
it is the question of control which is at issue here .
national states provide development aid , so does europe .
national states support the women 's movement , so does europe .
i come to two points here .
the first is access to information .
why ?
because parliament and the commission cannot agree about what access we have to information .
in this way , we can keep the pressure on and bring about real reform .
i do not share this view .
but whether it will be adopted at this stage remains to be seen .
i therefore hope to receive more support for our amendment which was completely voted down in the committee on budgetary control .
we in parliament set high standards for the commission , but do we set them for ourselves too ?
this is a political debate , and you must understand that we need you to act .
it is a general debate .
of course we must .
i should like to give an example .
i hope the commission will take our demands seriously .
as are we .
but what matter are the results which will be presented on 15 may .
i do not agree with all of it , of course , but nevertheless it was agreed by a majority .
mr president , i shall focus on only one point : access to information .
many of my colleagues have raised this issue this morning .
we need better access in order to move forward .
what we need from the commission is a new system .
that is right .
i would also like to comment on a few points which are included in the report of the committee on employment and social affairs .
i would ask the commission to pay more attention to this aspect .
this would not have been appropriate either , but i would like to take this opportunity to add these specific points to the list which is , in fact , already before you .
i hope the commission takes the time to look at this debate seriously .
however , for now , the commission has a number of questions to answer and i hope it will start right now .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
vote
therefore , the commission cannot accept amendments nos 3 and 4 .
i need not add anything further since parliament , i am sure , will welcome this .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before the final vote :
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before the vote on the amendments :
the rules are very clear .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
this proposal is a step in this direction and i can therefore only give it my support .
it will not be .
we want sustainable development in all these aspects .
( applause from the left )
the presidency 's conclusions talk of " the european social model " .
( applause from the right )
a lot of us have been through that already and we welcome many of the conclusions .
it is not up to the authorities to say how many women must go out to work .
it is action not words that is needed .
it is a question of strategy really .
the most basic example is employment .
we must review the ' best business impact ' initiative .
as the european parliament , we should not accept this .
we must not allow that to happen .
this is important and these are aspects which one would expect from a summit .
this is an existing document .
this is very serious .
secondly , social security .
that is clear .
my final point is , once again , the development of human resources .
thank you very much , mr president of the commission .
the debate is closed .
some progress was made on this issue too .
this summit was a start but much has to be done to turn words into reality , and we , members of this house , must be part of that new world .
will anything come out of a meeting of this kind ?
that was not , of course , the purpose of the summit .
and why not ?
such a step is significant .
i would like to add one more point .
why was this the case ?
it had never been done before .
it was the first time .
we took that step .
we , that is , parliament , the commission and the council , are all working towards this .
let me refer to some of the specific points made in the debate .
i wish that were true .
they certainly developed quite well in those two days .
it is a very practical document .
we have to do better and we can do better .
the first is the lack of a clear eu policy and the necessary instruments to implement it .
there are a number of things we will be doing .
it is much needed .
very often you need to use a number of instruments .
commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .
you have the overall responsibility for external relations from the commission 's point of view .
the honourable member is entirely right about that .
it has not always been the case in the past .
would the commissioner agree with that ?
i agree with the honourable member on that point .
that is unacceptable .
absolutely nothing has been done .
i just wish to add two points .
mr president , on a point of order .
question time ( commission )
first part
i certainly do not think that is an issue .
i believe we have asked you all the questions we were going to ask you today .
mr president , i should like to start by saying that i share the concern behind the honourable member 's question .
this is not a problem specific to the candidate countries of the european union .
allow me to tell you what we can do within the framework of accession negotiations .
it is a problem that should be a cause for concern to everyone in europe .
this is the rule in this house .
does the commissioner agree with that ?
thank you for your answer .
i thank the commissioner for his reply .
how do you plan to address this ?
i should like to thank you for your answer .
firstly , it does not start on time .
situation in turkey
turkey does not yet meet these criteria , which is why negotiations will not start until they do .
i should , however , like to say a few more words about the political situation in turkey .
including turkey .
that is very important .
they think it is positive that turkey is a candidate country .
but the old legal system is still there .
we know that and we would like the commission to look into that .
this is why we want to give turkey the benefit of the doubt .
changes need to be made here .
turkey has its internal problems , but it has its external problems , too .
but no , this is not the case .
no !
and this is something upon which we agree .
the european parliament obviously has an important role to play in this .
i think that here too , real progress has been made , although perhaps not progress which has a clear legal form yet .
i should like to close by saying that we are still just right at the beginning .
we are in fact at the beginning of the beginning .
the debate is closed .
that can be only good for the future development of this new technology within the european union .
i shall single out the points i think are most important .
i think it is important for health reasons .
what will happen if it does not do so ?
that is only right .
it is fair .
i believe these measures will help to do just that .
this is not acceptable .
firstly , the protection of public health .
secondly , the commitment to international agreements .
of course there are concerns on the part of consumers .
we must address those very real issues .
how do we ensure that we have access to all the relevant information ?
it must be seen in that context .
i am also fully aware of the political importance of certain other aspects raised by the proposed amendments .
this is both for administrative and legal reasons .
i should like a clear answer on this .
commissioner , do you wish to reply ?
your views are also welcome .
the debate is closed .
in short , we all know what we are talking about .
i propose that we change this system .
it is only a matter of four months .
we should not go down this road .
in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , we supported most of the amendments from the rapporteur and others and we do so again today .
we believe that this is necessary because we should now get the whole european union on the move .
why do we want that ?
this is a good move .
the amendments will be adopted .
finally , it is essential that these measures should be implemented as quickly as possible , since it is a matter of consumer rights .
it is high time we took action .
we will then be where we need to be .
we simply need this .
but the most important consideration is that it does not just get us talking , but that we should also do something about it .
i would like to express my thanks too : it is a good basis for better standards of consumer safety throughout the european union .
i agree with this .
it is absolutely essential to know what country the products are from .
the member states should have already prepared themselves for it .
we must take account of how the procedures will be applied in practice .
it has already been adopted by the committee on the environment and in the committee on agriculture .
however , i would like to ask your attention for a question of principle .
this is unacceptable in my view .
we must put our own house , our own part of the world , in order .
i wish we could find a new word for it .
mr president , i wish to begin by saying that i welcome the report .
i have a number of concerns .
i have one further question of the commission .
i seriously question that point .
this applies , for example , to proposed amendment no 20 .
with just over three months , we do not have much time left for a final decision .
are there any comments ?
after that members are free to move any other points of order .
i take note of your comment and will ensure this does not happen again .
could we find out why this has happened ?
( the minutes were approved )
this is not a question of internal affairs , but external affairs of great importance .
other colleagues have tabled amendments with a view to voting against that paragraph , and members may agree with those amendments .
i call on members to vote against this motion .
i am pleased about that ; it is a major step forward .
some countries have a different system .
i believe this is also an important principle where enlargement of the union is concerned .
this is precisely the point we have raised on behalf of the committee on budgets .
so too , however , must be the role of parliament .
my second point concerns energy .
so far , the member states have had their own technical standards and regulations .
unfortunately , my proposal to this effect has not been included in the current report .
how does it do this ?
that is what we need .
that must not be just on paper .
the intergovernmental conference of 2000 is taking place to make the union as effective as is required in view of the major enlargement that has been decided .
in this process parliament 's responsibility is very great indeed .
mr president , the european parliament does not take part in intergovernmental conference negotiations .
we cannot create an amsterdam 2 .
it is , of course , necessary to give the commission the powers it needs and make it responsible to parliament . this is precisely the issue .
we must adopt a more positive approach .
we do not have democracy in today 's eu .
we would like to make three points .
secondly , the importance of transport .
i have two comments to make on the report .
these changes are essential to the success of enlargement .
for example , to make things quite clear with regard to the commission itself , we proposed that each country should certainly have one commissioner .
we are well aware that certain member states have difficulties with some of these questions .
i think that is a good thing .
but it will soon be time for a decision to be taken , and , on behalf of the commission , i would like to put forward three points for consideration .
the first point concerns european defence .
so we can see some progress and certainly a political will to move forward .
we can see that today .
let me say a few words on this .
we have to start out from what we have .
our group , too , has therefore tabled amendments to this effect .
we would also thank the commission for this support .
this is a key issue for the citizens of europe .
this debate is going on between political and national groups in different member states .
therefore , this is an important debate and i believe the council should take account of the position we take .
here , the only risk involved in democracy is the risk taken in elections .
if not , the intergovernmental conference will not have been a success for our future .
these are the questions which remain following the conclusion of the treaty of amsterdam .
we have heard this before .
that is why we have to take the opportunity now .
i know that reform within the existing european institutions must take place .
what do we want to achieve as a european union ?
some people say that this is the last opportunity for reform .
our priority is enlargement .
that is essential for our future .
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
it is that very common position .
i hope you could address that issue , mr president .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before the vote
nothing of the kind has happened , however .
however , as proposed by the rapporteur , the amendments approved at first reading but not accepted by the council must now be included .
since 1998 , the commission 's proposals have been under discussion .
we are the representatives of the people .
so what is different ?
the answer is everything .
that is the nature of democracy and democratic decisions .
secondly , member states with a large population get more than their fair share .
we hope that this will receive support from this parliament .
madam president , enlargement is important for the people of europe .
the accession negotiations are now under way .
this is necessary if our citizens are to have confidence in european cooperation .
all present member states must be included and make their contribution .
it is important that each country should have a member in the commission .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , enlargement is the most crucial european issue as far as we are concerned .
in my opinion , we need more than that .
in fact 12 members voted for and 12 voted against .
i believe that our report is more serious .
that is not on !
this point is very important .
and from that point of view , i want to thank the council .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i just want to make three comments at the conclusion of this debate .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
these actions are very important and have been implemented in time .
the decisions were also taken at the right time .
as i said , the european union has been monitoring this situation .
we are monitoring this issue .
i know that there are a number of honourable members in this house who have done the same job for their own countries .
it is important to be aware of it .
so that is what we are doing .
my second point concerns food .
why do we still allow this to happen ?
it is not true that we show solidarity .
no .
i am not saying anything new .
thank you very much minister .
the debate is closed .
i would like to make a general comment regarding the conference .
further to this conference , i would like to single out five key points from my report .
first of all , the funding .
what is the progress here ?
this will allow economic and social development and progress in line with european standards .
here , however , we must pay attention to certain issues .
so what are these issues ?
so what are they ?
that is what is also in europe 's interests .
mr president , i will make three points .
such issues should be considered by the european union as well .
i would , however , stress certain points .
society is important , and that is why we must continue with information and culture projects .
then there is the issue of crime .
we have to make that a real process for them .
it is important to be clear about that .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
as they deal with the same subject , questions nos 1 , 2 and 3 will be taken together .
clearly it is in this context that the issues mentioned in the questions will be considered .
but no more !
but that cannot happen .
i am not sure that you have asked a question .
that was my comment .
this is very clear to me .
these are clearly administrative issues .
i would like to ask whether you can be more specific .
once again , if this is not a clear answer , i have no idea what is .
i want to thank him for his answer .
we must consider what happened in the past which was the cause of all this .
you say that the practical result of this action is not what was wanted .
a more effective result has not been possible .
the european union is not a country .
i do not know under what circumstances the european union would have to have a global and specific action plan in this respect or why , as a union , it would have to deal with this issue .
the union as such does not therefore have a specific and direct response to this type of question .
mr president , my question is quite specific and is , i believe , of direct concern to the eu .
i want to thank the council for its answer .
this is the answer to your first question .
will the council be taking due account of the specific contribution women can make to working for peace ?
in our opinion , this is not appropriate and the council has made no proposal in this respect .
mr president-in-office , i thank you for this reply .
do we then have a situation where the developing countries may now apply for funds ?
they were not able to before .
it is still not clear at this stage of our debate within the european union whether or not amendments to the treaty will be necessary .
in this respect , i can see no major problems .
i would thank the council .
" )
mr president , we have now heard you .
we have been aware of them for many years ; they are strong and we did not doubt them .
( applause )
( applause )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
what is included in these measures ?
we could not agree more .
in this respect , i am in total agreement with the conclusions of the rapporteur .
mr president , we see the reality of the situation all around us .
this is the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs .
how matters will turn out , however , we do not know .
i do not think that this is the right way forward .
we also have a few specific proposals in this respect .
this is a very important matter .
i believe that this is not right .
this freedom remains .
mr president , i would like to ask the commissioner if he could also reply to my question .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
strategy for europe 's internal market
the first one is the need to address , within the union , the impact of legislation on business .
he must make sure that from now on that a central objective is to help the internal market to move forward .
i hope that , together , we can really make the internal market work as quickly as possible .
mr president , i would like to speak on a point of order .
what the commission is trying to bring about is already so hard to achieve .
i would like to see the commission achieve what it has proposed to do first and then take it from there .
and he is right , of course .
let us hope that this will change .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank the rapporteur .
what better rapporteur could there be ?
you have all said so and i fully support you in this .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
young people are europe 's future .
mr president , i am very pleased to add my support and my group 's support to this report .
we will always ask for more money .
the budget is not enough .
it is perhaps parliament 's role to ask for more .
we can be pleased with our efforts and pleased with this report .
it is a very good report .
i hope that does not happen .
that is an excellent initiative .
i offer them my thanks for their work .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to ask you , and also the commission , for your help .
two questions still remain , however .
ladies and gentlemen , what is done is done .
this is certainly a step forward .
i welcome the commitment of the commission .
we hope that this approach will lead to a resolution of the problem raised .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we need to know what our objectives are .
but let us give them time .
what is even more serious however is that not even the united states like it .
this clearly remains an open question within the wto .
we support his report .
well , it is not enough !
and we have tabled amendments too .
there is still a need for a political compromise here .
this should be the european union 's policy .
that is essential .
i support the commissioner 's efforts .
he has a difficult task .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
vote
that is why i tabled this amendment .
on amendment no 5
after the vote on amendment no 5
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote
before the vote
parliament has not yet voted on them .
on amendment no 4
we do not want a list of measures , that can come later .
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we cannot accept that word .
but i have to apply the rules .
a compromise amendment has been put before me .
madam president , we would like to keep the compromise amendment .
i put the question to parliament .
madam president , i think it is fair that it be put to the vote .
i am only following the rules , just as i should .
( parliament decided not to put the compromise amendment to the vote )
right , thank you for making that clear .
is that right ?
that is the old text .
that is clear .
i proposed a solution in both cases .
before the final vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
"
we think not .
we are against such an approach .
that is clear .
but we know that .
we must come back to this issue and put forward a proper proposal on a matter which is of direct concern to this house .
mr president , i have voted against this report .
i voted against this report and i was not alone in doing so .
there is nothing of this , however .
i have therefore voted against .
this is why i voted for this amendment .
mr president , i voted in favour of the motion for a resolution although i did not agree with the individual points .
and i am sure that in the end there was not a single member here who could understand what this was all about .
the report on the intergovernmental conference is the european parliament 's contribution to that conference .
enlargement means more states ' representatives in parliament .
we believe that each member state should have a member in the commission .
that is why we have voted against this report .
if we are to make a success of enlargement a number of key reforms are essential .
therefore ,
we will therefore be voting against the report .
iraq
this is not acceptable .
we cannot allow this to go on .
it is not just here in europe that people are concerned , but right across the world .
can we allow this to go on without saying something about it ?
we cannot allow this to go on .
that is absolutely unacceptable .
i feel that we must then act in order to give practical effect to our resolution .
and that is essential .
this is important for all of us .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i ask you to act quickly .
we certainly cannot continue to accept this situation .
for my part , i would refer to the procedure which seems to me in this case to be important .
in this regard , we agree with the draft resolution .
the debate is closed .
the un 's high commissioner must continue to be supported in his work .
this is unacceptable .
either we have human rights or we do not have human rights .
the debate is closed .
human rights
mr president , what is the purpose of this joint resolution ?
our amendment in paragraph 5 is based on this very consideration .
there is no guarantee of the right to a defence .
we must also call on the union governments to do the same .
there is no such thing as an internal matter where human rights are involved .
yet again .
we hope that we shall one day be able to welcome turkey into the community .
everyone , both existing and future members , must respect these criteria .
unfortunately , turkey still has a long way to go .
these were his words to us then : " for five months we have had a new turkey .
when will this end ?
a great many people are involved here .
from this point of view , i feel we can congratulate ourselves .
mr president , we should be clear as to why this resolution today is so important .
this could take up to three months .
this would show real transparency .
with this in mind , we support the resolution .
the elections are therefore necessary .
the rule of law is necessary .
our main concern is the organisation of free and democratic elections .
the debate is closed .
there has been some progress but , unfortunately , not enough as yet .
it is , of course , also a waste of human resources that this is the way things are .
i am pleased with this resolution .
make resources available .
they cannot have any .
the debate is closed .
that is indeed the case .
nevertheless , everyone involved was aware of the circumstances .
the region needs security and stability .
we hope to open an office , but it is not one of our priorities at the moment .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
relating to the joint resolution on iraq
mr president , i think we should vote .
everyone has agreed to this specific proposal .
( the matter was referred back to the committee responsible )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
perhaps you could let me know later .
it is not an issue that we can deal with now .
mr president , do you feel young ?
i think you are saying that you do .
our young people are europe 's future .
our society does not have enough confidence in young people .
the problem , however , is the price .
this would be the case as a result of the amendment .
this amendment to the regulation must be made .
so what is this all about ?
why ?
it is always there and in itself is no problem .
that is a good thing .
i have asked the commission a number of questions in this regard .
i am also not sure what the financial consequences will be after enlargement .
i support the commission proposal but not the proposals of the committee on agriculture and rural development .
mr president , i am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking in the debate and i congratulate the rapporteur for his work .
let us be clear .
that is the reality of the situation .
it is good value for money .
we do not always achieve that .
i do not think so .
the union should develop its policy within this context .
we do not wish to be part of that .
thank you for your attention .
i should now like to ask a few questions .
these are amendments nos 2 , 3 and 4 .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
it will be included in the minutes .
vote
i think that we all know the rules by now .
( applause )
we cannot go on like this .
i think that goes without saying .
we are now working within the rules of procedure .
this is not the case .
i am giving you the floor for the last time .
according to the rules of procedure , a vote is to be taken on this .
( applause )
that is not a serious way of doing things .
this is not the way things are done .
everyone is , of course , free to act as they like .
information and communication
an information and communication strategy must , therefore , be high on our agenda .
that must be taken into consideration .
obviously , the parliament 's role is different to that of the commission .
that , mr president , is what i wanted to say for the time being .
when i speak to british groups , i often start with the question : do you want to be in the european union ?
why is this so ?
the commissioner said quite rightly that new technology is good .
we must make more and better use of it .
but not the european parliament .
i ask parliament , commission and the council of ministers to address that problem .
the aim of the information policy is to reach the citizens .
the commission has long had an office there .
the commissioner has mentioned the importance of national regions , as well as the states , in its communication policy .
it is not just the commission and parliament which need to think about their role .
that really must be taken seriously .
we thank you for this .
i do not think that it was !
we have to act .
i know about this problem .
i consider it very important .
so at least regional policy in this area will continue .
without them there is no way that we can get our information across .
( applause )
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i am taking note of this .
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start the debate .
i will tell you what the rules of procedure are so that we all know where we stand .
this is what we are doing .
i therefore call upon the commission to take action in this area .
the commission is of the opinion that decisions should continue to be taken at local level .
the vote will take place after the debate .
mr president , so what needs to happen ?
what i do want is to keep the discussion around this issue going and to continue where parliament left off before .
it was our own amendment , tabled on behalf of the european people 's party .
this is all well and good on paper , but this can be very difficult to implement in practice .
when will this happen ?
but this is not the case at all .
let us hope that it will improve .
this is something to be taken into consideration .
i do not think so .
i therefore come to my request : you have proposed specific measures to the commission in your report .
however , at the same time , we have to take into account the economic aspect of the issue .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i am , of course , making this request on behalf of my group .
mr president , i accept the vote which has just been held and that a decision has been taken to vote now .
this seems to me to be in the interest of the good rules of this house .
we are going by the rules .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i do not consider this acceptable .
i am speaking on a more general note here .
it would then become clear if we would be prepared to consider this a proper meeting or not .
this will not help us any further this morning .
this is clear enough , i think .
let us move on to the next item .
the question has been put to you .
what action are you going to take ?
secondly , what have you done and what have you achieved with the means available ?
the matter is urgent .
i will come back to this point in a moment .
the vote will take place after the debate .
the european union must take full responsibility for its citizens .
the time has come to move on .
yet we are well aware that this will take time .
in return the community must provide support for these products , especially at times of crisis .
you can see that .
it is the member state itself which has to adopt the necessary initiatives and provide for appropriate aid .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i am extremely concerned .
that is the real question .
it is true that some have left .
for that reason , i did not go along with it any further .
so thank you .
we simply need to return to the issue of the agenda again as soon as possible .
these resolutions are not legislative .
i will do so when you consider it to be appropriate .
i have taken note of your proposal .
it is important to know about this matter .
there is , however , a meeting of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market being held on that day .
i think that you could allow me that much time .
you will see that it is a serious matter .
i really cannot let you speak any longer .
it is quite out of the question .
that time is up .
i have already had an opportunity to discuss this proposal here in parliament .
madam president , i thank the commissioner for that report .
i would regard that as the wrong approach .
however , i would like to make one comment and then put a question to you .
in this connection , let me once again thank the european parliament for making such an effort to ensure that the necessary funds are available in the 2000 budget .
this item is closed .
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
' .
this is the situation in 2000 .
this is an unacceptable proposal !
we also tabled a motion to this effect on account of our common concern in committee .
they have not done so .
in fact , they have achieved nothing .
what effect does this have on the people in europe ?
perhaps an increase in the number of jobs in the short term .
unfortunately , however , there is still a very long way to go as regards its implementation .
the people of the region cannot understand that .
they did not do so .
let me just mention two projects that have been successful .
something therefore needs to be done in this regard .
let me make two final comments .
first , you should take another look at all the projects in the light of today 's debate .
i would consider the transport costs directive an appropriate legal basis .
i have put one of these projects before the transport committee .
the rapporteur who , by the way , has done a quite excellent job , has expressed his concern about this .
let me give an example of this .
furthermore , some of the projects present great technical difficulties .
i want to make this very clear .
the debate is closed .
these are questions which we are still left with .
what do we do then on our own ?
i think in future we will have to deal with four important points .
we can and must help improve safety agreements throughout europe .
this is a step in the right direction .
mr president , i only have a few minutes so i want to focus on just one particular point in the commission communication .
it is vital to guarantee their rights .
the impact of all these developments on the environment is of vital importance .
i would finally like to mention some basic points .
these are the reasons why we shall be voting against the report .
this is extremely important .
i have left two issues until the end , not because they are less important , but because i wanted to focus on them for a moment .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
furthermore , i believe that transparency is a good thing , not only in terms of the control which this house has to carry out , but it is also good in itself .
at least that is what i think .
mr president , i too would like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
the commission has to come up with proposals on these points .
i would like to add one more point which has not been discussed here but which i would like to bring up .
what should we make of it ?
in our opinion , we really need new standards .
this is what we asked the commission for .
it is clear that we continue to support this .
this is the question we need to ask ourselves .
that is a serious problem .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first i want to thank the rapporteur who , in my view , has done a quite excellent job on a very difficult subject .
no amendments !
that is a good balance .
it is , of course , global .
european business has to keep up and the key to this will be confidence .
confidence is essential .
our rapporteur has given us an extremely good basis .
i would therefore call on the commission to support initiatives to this effect .
i would like a reply to this question .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
i do not think so .
many thanks !
i think that means we have a very good policy in that area as well .
i would ask the commission to take that very seriously .
it is actually a global industry and it is around the world that we want to see a proper framework established .
of course , it is essential that we have a legal framework in place as soon as possible .
i think that is not good enough .
as so many have already said , the matter is urgent , and i agree .
this is , of course , true .
i would like to say a few words regarding the specific questions which have been raised by members of your house .
the risk is there .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
food aid 1999
but let me add a few general comments .
mr president , i also wish to congratulate the rapporteur .
that is very important indeed .
we must therefore congratulate ourselves on the fact that this issue is still on the agenda of the european parliament and the countries of the european union .
the debate is closed .
this is a very urgent matter .
we are now presented with a solution by this parliament , by our institutions in europe , where we want to and can help people where the problem is .
the need for this work remains as strong as it did four years ago .
the european union must help where it can .
the role of the national member states , however , is at least as important .
nothing more , nothing less .
i believe that the commission must answer to this and tell us what they are going to do .
a number of honourable members have made clear the good and practical work done as a result of this regulation .
so i hope that we can do better by the time we next discuss this important subject .
i also want to thank the commission for its good work in connection with the negotiations .
mr president , i too want to thank the rapporteur for his report and congratulate him .
it is a step in the right direction .
i very much hope we will make progress in this regard over the next few years .
they have no say as regards its content .
i would very much hope we could do that .
once again , many thanks and i hope we will adopt it by a large majority tomorrow .
we want more dialogue .
in fact , war never has been a solution for the people of europe .
the agreements are very important .
this , however , is not enough .
it seems that the direction is not always clear .
however , i have two questions .
could the commission be specific about this ?
therefore , the commission will support these amendments in the council and i hope they can be taken forward .
in some cases they will be available to us , in other cases they will not .
by means of both reports , the commission will have access to all the necessary budgetary information .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
perhaps i do not need to point this out .
this applies , for example , to the issue of the right to information .
the green paper is , of course , a good one .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
more information is required in this area .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i too would like to express our group 's support for the rapporteur 's report .
the debate is closed .
welcome
vote
i should like at this point to return to one aspect i consider more fundamental .
these are some of the reasons why we cannot vote in favour of this report .
i find this an example of european solidarity which is what we stand for in this parliament .
agenda
at the moment , we only have four .
this is what this motion is about and i very much hope members will support it .
( parliament approved the proposal )
now , i do not think that this is the appropriate place to debate this .
all we want is that it should also be discussed and that a vote should be taken on it .
madam president , on a point of order .
i just wanted to point that out .
madam president , on a point of order .
this must be a first !
i only hope that you will understand this .
i support the action in this sense .
we must get a serious discussion under way about these matters .
i cannot therefore put this request to the vote .
we need to change fundamental aspects of our agriculture policy for the long term !
that is what i want to prevent at all costs .
nothing more , nothing less .
despite this , the commission has made various proposals to benefit from the agricultural budget , if possible .
but that is not the case !
in fact , we are discussing the proposals which the commission has tabled following the agenda 2000 reforms .
i would like to add a few more points , however .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , agenda 2000 has created a certain kind of stability for the european agricultural policy .
the question therefore is : what are the farmers doing about this ?
the question is what will farmers and consumers do about this ?
will they step up their fight ?
and you have our support .
after all , it is the first which you have tabled in the house .
i shall now turn to the individual amendments put forward .
that is why i cannot accept this proposal .
that is why i cannot agree to amendments nos 2 or 5 .
it does not present a particular problem to farmers .
however , i have to tell you that the results will not be available until the end of the year .
however , in principle , it is the member states who are responsible for this issue .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the committee on agriculture and rural development adopted this report by a large majority .
we therefore also ask you to consider the proposal presented by the committee on agriculture .
mr president , i am pleased to have this opportunity to address parliament on this very important issue .
i congratulate the rapporteur and call on the european parliament to support the agriculture committee 's report .
these were the words of the local minister for agriculture for that region .
you know what procedure this is .
that would be " far out " of place ! moreover , it is something i shall be voting against .
the proposal before you today has three main objectives .
this principle also applies here .
a reform of this sector is absolutely essential !
i think that you agree with me on this .
we really should not allow this kind of situation to develop .
mr president , allow me to ask the commissioner one more question .
perhaps i will begin with the second question , which was asked by the rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
but that is not the case .
the debate is closed .
the council finally presented its proposal .
of course , the rapporteur also referred to this .
in making these efforts , the rapporteur has , for his part , done everything within his power to present a proper report on the regulation .
we thank you very much for it .
we are clearly in a very serious situation .
this budget line is the work of the european parliament .
decisions need to be made .
let us be clear what we are talking about .
would the commission be able to answer that ?
the commission might like to comment on this particular point .
we also support the second amendment .
the time has come to say enough is enough !
the commission was simply making a point on amendment no 2 , as i understand it .
decision on urgent procedure
it has done so in the past and will do so in the future .
as for budgets , our main concern is where the money is coming from .
mr president , i am in favour , although i take the view that it is not quite as urgent as the council makes out .
it cannot take it away from kosovo .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
that is the wrong way forward .
it is not the job of the budget to make such fundamental political decisions .
i am pleased to see the commissioner is now with us .
i should like to thank everyone who supported me in this matter of concern .
that is the right way forward .
we support this and hope that it can be brought to a conclusion during the course of this year .
i am not against this increase , in principle .
we shall see , in time .
but not in this case !
at no point do we go over parliament 's 20 % share of administrative costs .
and it is needed .
that is what the rapporteur is doing , and i think it is excellent .
i am not saying that we have done that .
not all the decisions will be taken when we vote this report through .
this applies to the european union as a whole .
the decision will be taken for us .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i stress this because it will certainly play an important part during the debate with the council .
this is therefore a very important step , not a technical step , but an important political step .
so far so good .
we can support that .
but what about parliament 's priorities ?
i will give you an example .
but that is not for next year .
that is for the future .
i request that this be put to the vote .
the report has been available for some time and i therefore see no reason why we cannot debate and vote on it .
obviously , the commission 's legal service took a different view .
three points on the content of my report .
the legal basis for this is in place .
together with the council , we have done everything within our power .
that cannot work and it does not work .
( applause )
the fact of the matter is that member states have a high responsibility here .
my final point concerns the accession countries .
also , the date mentioned in the report is important , in our opinion .
we support the commission so as to make this possible .
this is not a proposal for a legislative initiative .
i think this report is a waste of a lot of paper .
what are we not allowed to see ?
it is other expenditure that we should be concerned about .
mr president , my last point concerns the european parliament itself .
allow me to congratulate you on this report .
i do not agree with all of his report .
reform of the commission is now under way .
i would also point out that i had three minutes in which to speak .
you are quite right , you had three minutes .
no ?
we want to know whether the member states will follow that lead .
they have had five years to do it .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
vote
however , for some technical reason , the services did not receive it .
madam president , i should like to speak for the motion .
madam president , in that case may i again ask the house to vote to refer the report back to committee .
( parliament decided to refer the second part of the report to committee )
"
the european union , as a result of the treaty of amsterdam , has greater powers to bring forward legislation in the field of consumer rights .
this is because i feel that we should change the way we support and provide aid to agricultural products in the european union .
it has now presented it .
so far you have presented no proposal on this .
here too we need to take the member states to task more .
allow me to make a few comments on the proposed amendments and then , thanks to the speaking time for my group , i shall still have time for a comment at the end of the debate .
this would cost a great deal of money .
mr president , i would first of all address the commissioner and say that i naturally welcome the present proposal .
i wish to support in principle all the amendments from the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection .
there are therefore two things which must be done .
my group has not tabled any amendments and is in full agreement with you .
we give you our full support and have every confidence in you .
i would like to home in on the following issues .
why not ?
why ?
this is nothing new .
so this regulation is a good one .
i think , commissioner , that these are questions we also have to ask .
of course we need that .
which is why i believe that this regulation is a good regulation .
i will be the first to support it .
this is working .
i will say no more as far as that is concerned .
both issues are important , but we must be able to show clearly the priority of values ; public health comes first .
that is an issue which i have referred to before .
thank you again for your cooperation .
the debate is closed .
organisation of working time
my thanks go to all of you .
this has already happened in the case of road transport .
that was an important point of progress .
it is very important that we get movement in that area in the transport council .
i am very pleased that they are going to be brought in line with the working time directive .
this is a health and safety issue , as has been said , for both the workers concerned and for the public .
there was , therefore , not so much of a compromise on that particular point .
we also want , in the future , to see the working time directive apply to those groups which have still not been brought within its scope .
i hope that this will continue .
i have one small , further request to the commissioner .
that is the problem .
it is now up to the commission .
more of this later .
the results are acceptable .
i shall come back to this point .
mr president , i would like first of all to make three political comments .
i should like to stress that it is indeed a particularly important issue .
we have discussed this in the past .
i thank you very much for all your support and help during these discussions , and that of your services .
the debate is closed .
we have brought forward in the document , which has now been made public , our proposals for dealing with this problem .
that remains a possibility for the long term though it would take some time because one would first have to get in place the necessary legal framework .
that is for the future .
we have to do better .
i am sure this will be a long debate .
i am sure that parliament will have a considerable contribution to make to the discussion over the next few months .
what we are doing here will be part of that change .
this is the situation as we see it .
as parliament is aware of this , we will offer our full support .
what will happen to humanitarian aid ?
i actually wanted to put my question to him .
that goes without saying .
this is clearly part of what we have decided .
this is a well established discussion .
it is absolutely necessary to make these measures clear .
we would welcome a little more competition as far as that is concerned .
that is not the case .
question time ( commission )
first part
what action did the commission take ?
these efforts by the commission will continue .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his response .
i would , however , like to add something .
thank you mr president .
if he does have it , i would like him to say so , but i understand from his second reply that he does not .
second part
so how are we to deal with this situation ?
are you going to increase them ?
what kind of large budget ?
is it a large eu budget which is being considered ?
earlier i referred to the fact that the situation is different in each of the member states .
what has happened with the euro ?
we believe that a strong economy means a strong euro .
therefore , allow me to make a rather more general comment .
with regard to the basic problem , i would make a different comment .
our concern has always been not only greater employment but also greater quality of employment .
thank you for your comments .
mr president , there is not very much to thank the commission for .
so there is nothing to thank the commission for .
with which candidate countries has most progress been made ?
that has been done .
they come at the end .
if there were , i would know about it .
but there is not .
however , i can still answer the question , because the commission naturally has an opinion on the points which you raised .
the region which you come from and the region which i come from are just such regions .
but we have not yet reached that point .
however , if you take the view that there is a connection , then i am prepared to answer the question and am able to do so .
what are the conditions under which services are provided ?
what are the conditions under which people are working ?
these are two very fundamental points and i should like to know what the commission or your position is on this .
there are two questions .
i am not going to get into a debate .
you mentioned the problem of resources .
first of all , if you allow me , i have here a note in french .
i believe i have given you all the information available to the commission on the subject .
and if they are not , then we must take legislative measures .
in terms of political action , the transport sector must be our priority for the following two fundamental reasons .
i should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur and vote in favour of this report .
the debate is closed .
what is the subject matter ?
this is now a thing of the past .
this should not be done again .
i also hope that the council will accept our proposed amendments .
safety is also , without doubt , an issue .
mr president , commissioner , a great deal has been said in today 's discussion .
and all this in the year 2000 !
what is the problem ?
i think that is important .
but still !
therefore , let us deal with this issue when other points are under discussion .
as a result , a lot of things work well within our countries .
i would like to speak on this particular subject but from a regional aspect .
so we have to take a really serious look at what we are talking about here .
i certainly want it within my region because that is important .
most of the amendments to the report are acceptable .
when it comes to the amendments , i only wish therefore to deal with those which are unacceptable .
the council should accept our opinion and the commission should support us , not the council , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
local people often ask me what the eu is going to do about it .
i would ask what does " urgent " mean in this context ?
it is also clear that our member states do not wish to give up this responsibility .
i have no time .
this is unacceptable .
i do not .
no , it did not !
no , it did not !
no , it did not .
let us be clear .
i wish them well .
but words are not enough .
nuclear safety in the enlargement process is a major cause for concern .
it is in the interest of all of us to ensure that our citizens have confidence in our safety and security systems .
we need european rules .
i should be pleased to come to parliament at any time to continue this discussion .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i would like to make a comment in relation to yesterday 's minutes .
but we in the european parliament - what are we doing ?
nothing .
( the minutes were approved )
firstly , there is competition .
this is a very important development .
finally , the basic problem still remains .
now it is the euro .
it is now quite certain , however , that this state of affairs will always be best for all countries at all times .
let us encourage women .
we need a strategy .
do we want even more ?
that is one of the reasons why the united states is doing better than europe .
it is not just in that area .
this is a crucial point .
as far as the working population of the countries of the european union is concerned , there really is not much to be pleased about .
we shall therefore be voting against this report .
mr president , we do not support the commission 's guidelines .
this is not an issue we can go into today , but i wanted to make those points .
a major point of concern throughout this debate has been the development of investment .
that is why public and private investment are absolutely essential .
i would like to make an additional comment on two points .
these include , firstly , labour reform , which we discussed earlier .
it is clear that not all the states have implemented the labour reforms which we consider appropriate .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we know it is .
this could have been brought out more clearly in the report .
the euro has provided greater stability .
price competition has increased , and there has been greater transparency .
unfortunately , this union is only monetary , not economic .
we agree .
agenda
ladies and gentlemen , i should like to make things quite clear .
vote
joint motion for a resolution
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the joint text )
( parliament adopted the joint text )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
why am i in favour of this measure ?
it is better than nothing , but not much !
it is now crucial that these sectors can , at long last , look forward to a regulation so that they too come under the scope of the directive .
in such circumstances , how can we expect the european union 's social policy to be taken seriously ?
i have therefore supported the amendments tabled by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
i feel we should take account of this throughout the debate .
i look forward to that day .
i have a problem with that country .
but the central bank , for example , is not concerned with the euro 's external value .
i think it is time for some changes .
for me , the reason for this is clear .
there is a lack of confidence in the european governments .
are they sustainable ?
this is the end of a process .
the debate is closed .
can something be done about this ?
the rules must be applied in the same way to all parties .
thank you very much , mr president .
that is nothing new .
it would not be right to create a new opportunity for the commission to step in .
i would now like to turn to some of the comments made .
the debate is closed .
we are all aware of the situation .
peace between nations can only be achieved if there is balance .
what action are we taking to prevent this ?
that is naturally not enough .
the question we are left with today is : what will come of this ?
well , here is one of the most important reasons .
in my opinion , conditions should very much be part of the deal .
mr president , we should really call for something to be done about this .
i do not believe that to be the case .
i turn to the matter of whether too few countries are part of the initiative .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the people understand that and are aware of it .
we must also make our position very clear .
they demand the elections .
it is their future .
i would therefore like to back up the commission in this opinion .
we must avoid this at all costs .
but there is some way to go right now .
this is the kind of system we have .
yesterday 's discussion about the external relations reform is even today relevant .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
we will begin question time .
i hope that this is in fact the case .
mr president , on a point of order .
that i do know about .
however , we shall continue with our agenda .
i will take good note of your question .
mr president , i should also like to thank the president-in-office of the council for his answer .
will the council now make a statement on the issue ?
i wish to thank the president-in-office for his response .
that is all .
this matter should be considered at the intergovernmental conference . '
does the council take the same view with regard to the legal basis for this ?
i would like to tell the president-in-office of the council and the honourable members that we are discussing these issues within parliament .
the question concerns the legal basis and the intergovernmental conference .
i did ask a specific question about fisheries .
president-in-office , thank you for the answer .
will that remain the case ?
what must not happen is that a country that is not part of euro 11 is asked to set the agenda for those that are .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
that is something we shall address in the next communication .
these two reports deal with issues both large and small .
this will also take into account the results of the overall discussion which is now taking place in the 1999 review .
the debate is closed .
how can this be ?
the debate is closed .
european research area
at present , there is no european research area as such .
as such , the framework programme certainly makes a considerable contribution to this 10 % .
i would like to thank my colleagues for their kind cooperation .
there is indeed a european crisis in research funding .
we must increase it .
we also need other things .
that is also vital .
while i have the floor , i would like to bring up a few additional points .
the first is that european investment in research is at least as important as the european research area .
this is what our approach must be .
cooperation , however , requires organisation .
we cannot do this to the commissioner either .
this is not the case .
this is why we support the commissioner !
investment in research and in cooperation must lead to more economic growth and more employment .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , i would like to add my thanks to those that have been expressed already .
as regards fundamental and applied research , i think this is a matter of balance .
the first stage is clear .
thank you very much for your contribution , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
as such , it is an important report , because it will be the only report from the european parliament .
europe has done this in the past and we must be able to continue to do this .
i would like to direct my second point to parliament itself .
this was also said a moment ago .
as for women 's rights and human rights , i hope that some progress can be made at the intergovernmental conference .
i would mention two areas , in particular .
we know that in many developing countries , the economy is carried by women , and we support this .
this much we now know .
that is unacceptable .
is that not so , commissioner ?
i should like , however , to point out a number of things .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is the first time that we have had the opportunity to welcome you here , mr president , and i am very pleased to do so .
i am therefore particularly pleased to welcome you here today .
some of them will not get there without help .
once again , i thank her .
allow me to refer to what was said in this committee .
in the second paragraph it said : " tomorrow we will continue to discuss this issue " .
the vote had already taken place in the legal affairs committee .
i would now like to make a comment in relation to the rules of procedure .
( applause )
i accept full responsibility in this matter .
this is therefore an extremely important responsibility for both your president and this house .
this is my proposal .
is this now clear to everyone ?
the decision is not final and therefore cannot be accepted .
we absolutely must find the best solution .
we are now in a difficult position .
we do not have such a document .
the president is right .
understand that if you can , but it is up to the french parliament to reform this law .
this can happen very quickly .
that is your right .
there is a legal problem here that only you can clear up .
that is your task , madam president .
( applause )
this is the best solution for everyone .
madam president , on a point of order .
that is my first question .
that is another issue .
we agree .
they would .
i would ask you to accept this request .
at what time will it start ?
i have a right to know .
various initiatives have already been taken at european level .
a great deal therefore remains to be done .
our priority must be to give aid and assistance to the victims .
we must welcome and help them .
mr president , it has already been said .
finally , i would like to state that this is an important communication from the commission .
we will therefore continue to support this proposal .
this should not happen .
the problem is urgent and effective measures are required .
the debate will take place as proposed .
vote
mr president , the resolution by the green group was tabled first .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
as a result , i will not take part in any vote on this report .
i do not want to have a debate on this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , on a point of order .
could we be clear that the rapporteur is giving the committee 's view and not his own ?
i think that is a matter for you to discuss in your committee .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
a number of amendments have been tabled which were , in fact , already in the text when the vote was taken in committee .
it is quite out of order that we should do anything other than vote on each of the points on the voting list .
i do not want to start another debate .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
that will be the agenda .
mr president , on a point of order .
that was the point here !
this seems unacceptable to me .
the house did that earlier .
that was a decision for the house .
it was not agreed we would reduce the time of that debate , let us be clear on that .
you are right .
mr president , on a point of order .
could you provide us with information on that ?
what procedures have been put in place ?
i have no information on this subject .
this is why i have voted in favour of amendment no 2 .
this cannot and will not happen .
as a result we have voted against the report .
i must firstly congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work .
can you believe it ?
however , major problems remain .
the reason for this is clearly the cost of access to these new services .
europe as a community of values .
i would now like to move on to the commission 's proposal .
i hope that this addition can be adopted by the commission .
everyone is different , everyone is equal .
this has to stop .
firstly , i want to congratulate the commission on this text .
it is a good text .
many of the basic principles we wanted to see are in it .
they want this legislation quickly and they want it now .
it is important legislation .
it is very important that we get it through today .
that is the first point .
regarding the other points of the report , i do have to say that the nature of a directive is such that you do not need to be too specific .
this is , after all , the nature of the directive .
we will not be voting in favour of this , or rather , we will be voting against this .
this is what it is all about .
i know that the debate in the council is also a difficult one .
this is taking it much too far .
welcome
the first is of a general nature .
this is unacceptable .
but first of all , we have to do our work .
parliament 's amendment takes the commission 's proposal one step further .
we are here discussing this directive .
i should like to comment on a number of amendments .
i have another four points i would like to make , mr president .
the same system is now also being proposed with regard to this directive .
and on time !
the european parliament has also made its own contribution .
she has achieved a great deal .
for all these reasons we must vote for this report .
either way , the result is the same .
mr president , i wish to make three points .
it has been a long time coming .
i shall not , therefore , be voting for the present amendment .
i welcome the directive .
that is why the amendments about training , monitoring and implementation are so important in this directive .
the time is right to do so .
( applause ) .
the debate is closed .
however , our commitment must not end with this call .
but what are the economic interests behind the government 's actions ?
the debate is closed .
this situation must change .
the resolution is clear .
something has to change .
that goes back longer than last may .
the debate is closed .
human rights
on the right to safety at euro 2000
without the political will to end the situation , the violence can only continue .
we therefore believe that this house should follow that line .
why ?
these relations are too important for this .
the french government should follow the example of the british government .
what action would we like the commission and council to take ?
i do hope that members will support this motion , because this is something we can actually change for the better .
this is wrong for several reasons .
despite that , is there still a risk ?
of course , but then there is always a risk .
in this respect i believe there to have been a recent example in france which is very important .
we share the concerns of the european parliament about the local elections there .
i just wish to make two additional points .
i would just like to add one point .
i very much hope that euro 2000 is a great success .
the debate is closed .
mr president , on a point of order .
that was the rule under which this practice has been established .
let us move forward now to the vote .
mr president , on a point of order .
we had the debate on this this morning , we made our decision , let us just get on with it .
vote
mr president , people are different , yet of equal value .
these matters continue to be national concerns .
however , such initiatives are no longer enough .
we must lead the way in this fight .
women and children are involved .
this report is very good .
the member states must develop a more united , responsible policy .
i will therefore try to address a few of these key issues .
in addition , more focus has been given and needs to be given to developing our cooperation through specific projects with the candidate countries such as several members have mentioned of parliament .
i would like to add a few important points .
why not ?
i would also like to say on behalf of my group that we fully support the proposal to refer this initiative back .
mr president , the commission would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
are there any comments ?
therefore we should do something about it now and not just talk about it .
madam president , thank you for giving me the floor .
are there any other comments on the minutes ?
there are no further comments .
( the minutes were approved )
vote
i should like the position of this house to be made very clear .
according to the agenda , the vote should have taken place today since the amendments were not put to the house in time yesterday .
of course , the best way to do this would have been by voting on this important report today .
before the start of the vote
president .
relating to amendment no 10
i wanted to point this out .
relating to amendment no 5
i think that things have now been made quite clear .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this concerns everyone : the international community , individual countries and the european union .
i would very much like to support this report .
this really has to stop .
at least one organisation is trying to draw this matter to the public 's attention .
the european union has to take responsibility on this issue .
in respect of the proposed amendments , i should stress the following .
amendment no 3 is not acceptable to the commission .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
this compromise , of course , has already been agreed with the member states as being more appropriate .
for this reason , with this amendment - which i think should be taken into consideration - we accept the overall proposal from the commission and i hope that the commission will in turn accept our amendment .
we are therefore always prepared to take the necessary measures to protect them .
the regulation which we are dealing with is not a new one .
these measures are a step in the right direction .
these measures have , i understand , already been accepted in principle by the key parties involved .
mr president , this is an important subject .
we can improve our resources .
there is no need for it .
i hope that was not true .
the general aim of competition law is to ensure that there is competition in the european internal market .
we will deal with the first of these areas today .
considerable account will be taken of parliament 's resolution in this process .
significant change will be necessary here , but key questions exist in all the other areas .
i would like for this to be the case in other areas as well .
what is going on here then ?
this cannot be right , mr president !
mr president , i just wanted to ask one question .
statement by the president
madam president , on a point of order .
thank you . i shall take note of your comments .
the report in question is the report on the war in kosovo .
this is not acceptable .
are there any comments ?
i should like the position of this house to be made very clear " .
are there any other comments on the minutes ?
there are no further comments .
( the minutes were approved )
agenda
madam president , naturally we are very concerned about the situation in kosovo .
we are not here to start a debate .
let me make that point .
firstly , there is the respect we have for our own rules of procedure .
( parliament approved the proposal )
since the priority was to deal with other issues , it could not be discussed .
i think the house must decide .
i understand that the same view has been expressed by members of different parties in germany .
i therefore think that the matter is quite clear .
on behalf of my group , i would therefore express support for the draft decisions tabled by the rapporteur .
but , mr president , this is not how it is of course .
this is our business .
and rightly so !
i , however , do not share this doubt at all .
if it had been a public health directive , then other measures would have been proposed .
even a court of law does not simply apply law on its own in such cases .
mr president , i too have only two minutes to present the position adopted by my committee .
the commission has made no reference to this effect .
this is not , however , the case .
this is not the future we want for our own children .
i should not like to think that this might be our objective .
i would like to add one other point .
as a result of the amsterdam treaty we now have an equal say with the eu governments in the area of legislation on public health matters .
i feel people should be left in no doubt as to the fact that there should be a ban on this .
we brought about a great deal of change , and rightly so .
that is what this directive should aim to achieve .
i am a good example of why we should adopt this report now .
the question is whether we want this .
we have an opportunity of doing something about that this week .
mr president , it is very difficult to find new things to say at the end of this kind of debate .
we must make a clear assessment of the consequences .
the state should fund it .
however , i do not consider that this is appropriate .
i should now like to refer to the report presented on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
the amendments proposed in this report are of a very high quality .
i should now like to set out the commission 's position on the amendments proposed .
this is a necessary first step before we can go any further .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
what is the situation today ?
we must also stress the importance of research .
the council has included most of these amendments in its common position .
so what kind of protection is there ?
on this issue , the commission supported the european parliament at first reading .
other amendments cannot be approved .
the debate is closed .
at second reading , parliament adopted ten amendments to the council 's common position .
i believe we have found a compromise of benefit to all parties .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i welcome the good result which the european parliament and the council have achieved on this important issue .
the debate is closed .
this is still the case , of course .
we need to avoid this at all costs .
this is a step in the right direction .
it has to come from the industry .
it is also a cultural europe .
the rapporteur 's conclusion is that open standards are now needed .
"
competition alone does not guarantee it .
they make some things possible more than others .
however , the market is developing open standards .
i fully support this .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is completely new .
this also means that i can see two developments in this field , which cause me some concern .
that is democracy .
this is why this report is so important .
finally , i would like to draw attention to amendments nos 3 and 4 .
i would like to congratulate him on having done so .
we are indeed dealing with a market .
is it , however , possible that the matter has become urgent today ?
i would like to focus on a few points relating to this important report .
however , this sector is not just about access for everyone and as much freedom as possible for the consumer .
this may be at member state level , but it may also be at eu level .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to congratulate our rapporteur on the report which he has presented to us .
it is right to keep that under review and not to make a significant change at the moment .
let me add four points , which i consider are important , to this debate .
firstly , regarding the principle of competition , i could never accept this being considered an end in itself .
that is wrong .
i do not believe so .
we need transparency in this sector to this end .
it has an impact on the economy , the information society , global competition , europe 's position in the world and employment .
many important things have been said .
i also want to congratulate the whole committee on industry , external trade , research and energy on the quality of its work .
i find it a very important issue .
we shall come back to that issue in our final proposal .
eu strategy on financial information
the next item is the commission communication on european union strategy on financial information .
thank you , commissioner .
mr president , on a point of order .
vote
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the joint text )
colleagues , let us try to address ourselves to the business in hand .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
on amendment no 10
it is out of time .
( parliament adopted the resolution ) president .
this is a small step in the right direction .
it is important to get the right balance between the eu and member state levels .
i hope that this will happen .
question time ( commission )
first part
have you , the commission , done anything ?
is there nothing more that he and this union can do to help this new state ?
this decision has been entirely their own .
i want to thank the commissioner for her answer .
second part
i wish to thank the commissioner for her response .
i agree .
however , there is a risk of taking it too far .
this was a welcome step .
does the commission believe that these policies could be applied to the research budget ?
unfortunately , i do not yet have a report from the meeting .
that is very important .
i ask him to direct his attention to that .
i will pay attention to the issues which were raised by the honourable member .
i should like to thank the commission for its answer .
- thank you for the question .
outside this issue , it is very much a question of the member states .
there the question is how to make this essential issue a priority for the member states .
i would thank the commissioner for his answer .
i am sure we will come back to this issue later .
i thank the commissioner for his reply .
there is a lack of agreement .
this is why many community programmes are open for such organisations to take part .
commissioner , you give a very full response .
so , let us give it some time and let the projects develop .
so there is a problem here .
i hope that parliament can support this proposal made by the committee on budgets .
this is not current research .
certainly not !
however , the european parliament has a budgetary role , which is why the commission 's budgetary proposals are not acceptable .
only certain member states create nuclear waste , and these are the states that should therefore pay for dealing with it .
that is not the way to go about things .
this is why , in the first place , we are not in favour of dealing with the problem of cost as a side issue .
i hope that he will promote this dialogue at every given opportunity .
i would , however , like to make one comment regarding the report .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
why not ?
that is not the case today .
i do not share that view .
it is the same problem .
the commission might wish it had , but it has not .
the debate is closed .
just as we agreed with the 1998 amendment , and for the same reasons , we are going to support these amendments in the terms proposed by the commission .
a final comment .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the majority in the committee on economic and monetary affairs did not agree with me on this .
make of it what you will !
because we do have experience of it .
there is research data on that .
i happen to come from a region where such education has been provided .
what happened ?
and we still have an additional problem .
that is the issue here .
i have referred in part to points of order .
that report will also take into account the treaty 's general objectives , such as health policy .
i would once again like to express my thanks to the rapporteur .
as i was saying , i mean to make the most of my right to speak .
the debate is closed .
i was not in the last parliament , and it is clear that parliament has put a lot of work into this , but it has taken three years to get to the point where we are now .
there are two problem areas .
i would like to congratulate them on their work .
the debate is closed .
before we start with the order of business , there are still a number of points of order .
thank you .
as you can hear from the applause , the house has taken note of your comment .
are there any comments ?
in my opinion , this matter should be discussed in parliament .
are you saying that he did or did not vote ?
mr president , i have been reading the minutes and it does not say here that he would not have voted .
( parliament approved the minutes )
i now have another statement to make .
there is another motion , but that is not it .
i have taken note of the honourable member 's comment .
decision on urgent procedure
thank you .
according to the rules of procedure , one member may speak for and one member may speak against the motion .
)
president .
president .
european political parties
that really is what the debate is about in this house today .
just as my colleagues have said , these parties must be brought out into the light of day .
this is not just a question of money .
i hope that the commission can give me a clear answer to it .
first , there are european parties .
i have nothing against european parties .
mr president , this is a question of democracy .
parties of parties are not democracy .
that is my first point .
the political parties are united in this very place through you , in joint groups .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
security and defence
all that remains is article 5 .
it is still our aim .
the views of parliament shall be taken into consideration by the council .
if necessary , other working groups on specific issues may be created .
we need to step up our efforts of coordination .
i hope that we will have the support of parliament in working through it .
let me be clear about the commission 's role .
this is not our first effort to create as it were a common foreign and security policy .
let me start by making a positive comment .
one is the eu 's say .
i would like to make one final point .
it is not about power , but about taking responsibility .
furthermore , mr president , this european union project is not just a matter of a political , economic and military union .
one more point : the importance of parliament .
obviously not .
we do not want this .
today 's debate is the european parliament 's contribution to these efforts on the part of the european union as a whole .
the second point is about democratic control .
the government conference can benefit from this .
we need to address that .
they must be subject to parliamentary control .
this european security and defence policy must be subject to parliamentary monitoring in this house .
i think that is also our position and account should be taken of it at this summit .
the commission has a crucial role in this .
kosovo has been mentioned several times today .
mr president , minister , commissioner , honourable members , it is quite right to make crisis management the main objective of european foreign and defence policy .
i am extremely pleased that this process is going on .
the commitment of the member states is essential .
we too share these concerns .
those are all areas where we have brought forward proposals .
president .
the debate is closed .
welcome
vote
is this allowed under our rules ?
( parliament approved the initiative )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( the president approved the common position )
everything is in place for a vote to be held .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
president .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that cannot be the purpose of the compromise .
i would like to add something further .
but to what end ?
only once , mr president .
' and when was that ?
' you may ask .
but we are responsible for the health of our citizens and we must decide on rules here .
other regions must decide on their own regulations .
public health is not just any old interest , it is of general interest .
i am in favour of the commission 's proposal , and also of the amendments tabled in the report by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , which will improve public health protection .
unfortunately my proposal was not adopted .
however , i am not trying here to come to terms with the past .
this is simply not true .
it has nothing to do with the internal single market .
for my part , i would like there to be a free market .
in my opinion , the commission 's proposal is a rather good compromise , however .
and who was that ?
special un conference : women 2000
the fight against violence was put on every country 's agenda .
it is in our interest to fight for this .
but back to europe .
i would ask you to give attention to this .
they need to be involved in this process .
mr president , i should like to thank the presidency .
the fight goes on .
mr president , on a point of order .
i have always supported women 's rights .
i really do not know what you are talking about .
therefore , in my opinion , we have already achieved what was asked of us .
thank you , president of the council . we all share this hope .
the debate is closed .
you were speaking about a point of order .
you are quite right , mr president .
and this is the moment to do so .
we need true political will and the economic and human resources to put it into practice .
as we say in my country , by talking we come to understand people ' .
we do not work in this way .
the first , to which my colleague referred , is political dialogue .
nevertheless , there are issues which give considerable cause for concern .
what are we trying to do there ?
but there is more than that , which i will come to in a moment .
i just want to make it clear to the honourable member that my commitment to making this policy a success is total .
i would like to make two comments .
this is something we know about .
this is an extremely serious matter .
which is why we cannot do without it .
the enlargement of the european union is not our only priority .
the debate is closed .
however , at this stage these are just proposals .
this is as far as the legal and the institutional answer goes .
they are either in place or will be implemented soon .
so the results are clear .
mr president , i have two short minutes in which to make four points .
this simply cannot carry on .
finally , human rights .
it has already increased a great deal and , through accession to the wto , it is going to increase a very great deal more .
another matter is that of human rights .
his assessment is that the wto agreement will not benefit human rights at all .
therefore , we have the right to ask a few questions .
that is what is on the agenda .
the debate is closed .
clearly there is pressure on our agenda today .
but we take very good note of this proposal .
question time ( council )
the position mentioned by the member has not been presented to date to the council and we cannot , therefore , comment on this matter .
will it bring it to the attention of the french presidency ?
the council needs to get its act together .
therefore , any information which may be received in this respect by the council will be welcome .
mr president , the council has never been asked to discuss the issue raised by the honourable member .
as i said , no proposal has been presented to the council on this issue .
i should like to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
yesterday i tabled the same question to the european commission .
i received its reply today .
on the one hand he says that it is not a community matter , it is a matter for the member state .
does the president-in-office agree with this reply , if that is what he has in mind ?
only the commission would have the authority to act in this respect .
mr president-in-office , i should like to be a little more specific .
my question is quite specific .
thank you , mr president-in-office , for the information which you have given me .
also , has the council taken account of this possibility in its policy in the region ?
i wish to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
mr president , i should like to thank the presidency for its answer to my question .
how can we avoid this ?
there should be no doubt on this .
everything is open here in parliament .
we can discuss the issue of whether or not legislative decisions should be taken in public .
this is something which we have been discussing in the intergovernmental conference .
if europe does not stand for human rights then i do not know what it does stand for .
but from what you have said , that is not the case .
is that the case ?
in other areas a resolution will of course be necessary .
it is only since then that these issues have been raised .
this is not a matter for the council .
why ?
only time ?
may you achieve much for europe !
change to the agenda
the third question concerns the way in which we are going to carry out aid and regional coordination and integration .
this process was a success .
we therefore welcome the commission 's proposal .
we all know that full well .
however , i would like to stress certain things that he has said .
we just cannot say for certain .
i only wish there were not .
the third point i should like to make concerns the implementation of this aid .
i consider that to be far too long .
a coordination group is being set up between the commission and the member states .
as you know , it is not a question specific to this debate .
additional measures have been adopted by the commission in the framework of the community action plan .
the debate is closed .
asylum procedures
common principles were indeed seen as more important than individual political objectives .
that is hard to say , as there is not really a european asylum policy to speak of .
the previous european commission may have had the will , but did not have any power .
what needs to happen now ?
there are difficulties at hand though .
the national states are often not prepared as yet to support european rules .
do the eu 's institutions and member states now want to change these basic conditions ?
we have made a start , a good start and must progress hand in hand .
solidarity must be for all .
it is a good working document and we have a good basis to start working , so i congratulate the commission as well .
i thank parliament for the support that has been expressed for this communication .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
crime victims in the eu
why is this so necessary ?
this applies to all the european institutions .
this is excellent .
mr president , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
it is therefore crucial that we use these powers to improve the position of victims of crime .
as the rapporteur has said , they do not need to become victims again .
i congratulate the rapporteur on her work .
this is especially true in the case of terrorism .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
allow me to close with one more comment regarding the commission .
i am pleased that we now have before us a directive making that wish come true .
nothing more , nothing less .
the member states have been given two years to do this in .
i have another question for the commission .
the debate is closed .
you have , of course , every right to do so .
it really is absolutely unacceptable .
we will try to put an end to it .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes )
the next item is the joint debate on the :
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for this opportunity .
as for the development of the common european security and defence policy , again based on the report which we will present to the european council , i believe that significant progress has been made .
a report will be presented on the progress made on the tax issue .
next , of course , is the foreign policy we need to develop and , finally , the third priority is a real european security and defence policy .
that is a crucial point for us as well .
that is a second point .
first i want to talk about the enlargement .
progress has already been made .
as you know , the council has not reached agreement , but discussions continue .
ladies and gentlemen , a european council is a result achieved by a presidency .
in the economic field , what we need is greater coordination of economic , social and employment policies .
we in my group very much believe that .
in our opinion , this is very welcome .
i think that is the best favour europe can be done today .
the second issue is the intergovernmental conference .
its content is not in question .
the european union does not have any significant problems with fundamental rights .
then europe could be some use for once .
the programme we have heard today does not give us cause for any great hope .
we must stress the need for the creation of more jobs to be a priority and an objective of the european union .
we have no confidence in the union project .
it is not a case of one or the other , we need both .
first we must work on the content .
that is our main task .
we must be aware that the whole conference is set out according to the decisions taken in amsterdam .
all these points are extremely important .
thank you , minister .
it will take the initiative .
i am talking about success .
many thanks , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today .
( applause )
good , we have taken note of this .
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we will make every effort in order to make sure that this is done .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i have taken due note of this .
i voted for the motion in the hope that this further step will be taken as well .
the negotiations on this text were difficult .
i have therefore voted in favour of this text .
that was before the last european elections .
but despite that , the directive goes on .
i voted against this measure .
i do not think so ! i therefore voted against the motion .
this is not the best way to improve our relations .
that is what we said and that is why we voted in favour of it .
on that account i did not vote for it .
this is unacceptable to us .
1 .
2 .
3 .
4 .
there is no need to increase the overall european defence budgets .
in my opinion , it should only be possible to take military action following a decision in the united nations ' security council .
i cannot , therefore , support the resolution .
i thank the members for their important communication .
naturally , those responsible will be brought to account .
structural funds ( 1998 )
i also accept amendment no 1 and amendment no 2 , since they are in line with the report .
many positive changes have taken place since that time , not least since the new commission took over .
this was simply not the case during the last period .
people in work are a guarantee of peace and freedom in europe .
this is now being brought into question by the commission , something i find hard to understand .
we also refer to that principle in the report .
you asked me about your draft article 5 .
the debate is closed .
thank you .
that much should be clear to us .
if that happened things would be much , much more difficult and would take much longer .
we have some opportunities here .
the situation in kosovo today is different .
this is just as unacceptable as the previous situation was .
that is the question which at some point will need an answer .
they find themselves in a difficult situation .
help them .
it is up to you to offer them safety and freedom .
"
that is the situation we are dealing with .
we have been doing that for years .
it is in everyone 's interest to ensure cooperation between all kosovo 's citizens , on the basis of common institutions .
the debate is closed .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
while we are voting in favour of the resolution in question , i would like to point out two issues relating to its text .
mr president , first of all , this technical amendment has been voted upon , and i do not see why we have to come back to it .
we now come to the final vote .
they have already been voted upon .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , on a point of order .
whether you agree with an amendment or not should be the basis of the decision .
in fact , on reading the commission document and the report by the european parliament , we see that this was not the case .
once again , europe has shown its great sense of responsibility in taking an interest in crime victims .
what is the solution ?
i feel that it is time to change the european union 's system of expenditure .
cohesion fund ( 1998 )
however , we should point out two problems for the future .
this is something which , in our view , is very important .
i would ask the commissioner to give his opinion in this respect .
the form of the report is just as important as its content .
i share this concern .
the debate is closed .
it is extremely important .
we have recently been talking about regional funds and cohesion funds but the common agricultural policy is extremely important .
this is welcome .
that is a lot of money .
my group will of course support it .
that alone is not enough .
i very much doubt it .
there is no problem there .
i simply said that any decision would have to be taken in the framework of the intergovernmental conference .
the debate is closed .
this system involved a significant financial commitment .
at this rate , we will end up with nothing .
that is not the place to find a solution for these areas , as the commissioner and the whole of the commission seems to think .
in my opinion , there have been three changes .
it is an economic sector , i agree , but it has much greater environmental responsibility than it did ten years ago .
brussels does not want to be involved .
however , this does not make the production in the european union any less important .
that is quite right .
we need to be very clear about that here .
mr president , on a point of order .
i should also like to say this .
( applause )
we will now have to deal with these matters at home .
( applause )
are there any comments ?
i should like to draw that to your attention .
( the minutes were approved )
vote
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i am therefore using the time available to me to make this statement .
of course i voted for the report .
'
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
nor has there been an opportunity to bring in any changes that might be required .
this is a political issue .
that makes us feel good but does not actually change anything .
they have done a good , serious job .
they have asked very serious questions .
this is especially important and significant when we look at the whole question of enlargement .
they want to address this problem .
of course , there is not enough being done .
there needs to be more progress .
as far as i am concerned , this is the wrong way forward .
and they must be given the technical assistance to do so .
i support the amendments .
there are two comments i would like to make .
what guarantee is there that the member states will give their full cooperation ?
let me comment on that first of all .
it is , in fact , important that the candidate countries be involved .
the joint debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
following the vote on the commission proposal .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i therefore support this amendment .
and so indeed it must .
i shall be following that up and we may have to look into it again .
i should like to say this in conclusion .
that is wrong ; they voted in favour .
we shall have to vote on these amendments , but in another report .
i was at a conference last week .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is why we absolutely cannot accept this report .
statement by the president
action must be taken now .
are there any comments ?
thank you .
i would therefore like to thank you for your work .
this will give parliament the opportunity to express a considered , responsible opinion on the matter .
there has been a change of power there .
agenda
madam president , once again it is not the content of a motion for a resolution that is at issue here but our rules of procedure .
we know how important this is .
we have adopted resolutions on this subject time and time again .
president .
it is with this in mind that i ask you to support our request .
this is our opportunity to do so .
this also applies here , to iraq .
madam president , this is a point of order .
i do not know which rule of the rules of procedure this is based on .
that is why we should like to add this item .
we will achieve this through high levels of employment , economic growth and social cohesion .
thank you , mr president .
( applause )
the european council expressed strong support for what we are doing .
it is very important if we want those countries to trade more together that we should give them greater access to our own market here .
( applause )
there are at least two questions that i wish to ask you with regard to your speech .
another fundamental point is the progress in the intergovernmental conference .
free elections .
it is now the responsibility of the french presidency to find it .
we shall see !
absolutely everything is based on an intergovernmental approach .
we do not know what matters he is dealing with .
mr president , in the eu , matters are so often on the agenda that it is difficult to say when the various developments begin .
why does this matter ?
to make this possible we need to reform ourselves in the intergovernmental conference , and no progress has been made here at all so far .
there is no doubt that this is a difficult business .
that is why we need to put more effort into making progress here .
this is something that the commission and many in this house would like to see .
i have two comments to make on this .
i hope not .
i cannot therefore allow you to speak any further .
europe does , however , need more effective coordination of national economic policies , given also that we now have an independent single monetary policy .
follow the example of the united states for once .
the response to the reform process is significant additional investment from europe .
with how many countries should we actually begin further negotiations ?
here europe needs to act ; here we need more europe .
that is what the people of the eu rightly expect of us .
the same applies to employment policy and the european social agenda for that matter .
our citizens expect something more .
secondly , the intergovernmental conference .
to my mind , the issue is now quite clear .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i believe that we have here a very good example of cooperation between the european commission and the european parliament .
this has now been done .
the commission proposal should be seen in close connection with this article of the treaty .
a great deal of work needs to be done .
they have been particularly successful .
nevertheless , this new directive is necessary to allow more recent developments to be taken into account .
i therefore say to the council : make your decision quickly now !
it must not come to that !
the debate is closed .
however , it does not benefit the citizens .
and it is going to work .
i will end , mr president .
so the question for us must be : do we give them the protection that is on offer or do we say it is not enough ?
if we do that , then what will happen ?
they will come to their own conclusions about how they will change their system .
i wish we had that within our european union .
there has been much debate in my group about the impact and the legal effect of this report .
there is one good reason as to why this will not work .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
at the time the commission had already made a proposal which on the whole was very good and which also received support in parliament .
we see this as a step forward .
what is this ?
now it is the council 's turn .
i would like to draw attention to one or two points from it .
i also want to draw attention to a few amendments .
he is already aware of this , so i do not need to thank him yet again because i have already done so in private .
we can also accept amendments nos 1 and 5 .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i speak on yesterday 's minutes and something which is not in them .
but things cannot go on like this .
i would like to ask you what the reason is behind this procedure .
i shall , of course , ensure that this is done .
( the minutes were approved )
the next item is the joint debate on :
why did you not provide us with this information earlier ?
here too we have yet to see how this new procedure will work out in practice .
i think this is essential and indeed i believe it is the case .
this is how i see the action plan ; this is how i see our joint action .
i see it as a joint effort with the commission .
we lack regulation .
we believe that the commission is taking its time .
it is up to parliament to establish this and we will certainly do this .
that is not the case here .
i think we have done an excellent job .
it is a matter of some importance .
we shall support this report which the rapporteur is clearly against .
but where to now ?
to close , i would like to ask two of those questions .
( applause from the right )
that is my first point .
we shall also be working hand in hand with the european commission .
i had the opportunity to express my views on this subject last week .
the second focus of the french presidency is a europe at the service of growth , employment and social progress .
it is a success .
we can already see the positive effects in all the countries of the european union .
it is vital that the citizens accept the euro .
the french presidency will make every effort to do so .
this legislation must be put into practice and developed .
europe must be strong and open to the world .
this is precisely what is at issue .
( applause )
we wish you every success for the presidency .
we must ask ourselves what kind of europe we want and how we want to achieve it .
( applause )
furthermore , we want a strong commission .
it would be a good thing if this were applied to the intergovernmental conference .
( applause )
( applause )
in this area , regarding the environment , consumer protection and food safety , we are absolutely in agreement .
in conclusion , madam president , let me turn to foreign policy .
the europe of tomorrow matters to all of us .
we certainly agree with that .
we wish you and your government every success in the next six months .
( applause )
it is a real problem .
this is not acceptable .
that goes without saying .
i have taken note of the wish to see that the court of justice is given the necessary resources .
we shall do everything in our power to achieve this objective .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
we need time before we give our opinion on this .
if it is possible , so much the better .
enlargement is not a political decision .
there is no doubt about it .
peace and democracy cannot be established within just one part of europe , they must be established throughout the whole of europe .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
we do not do this enough , that is true , even though , in my opinion , a great deal of progress has been made in this area .
so , there has been some progress .
( applause )
decisions must be taken at the right level .
we shall carry on with our debate .
madam president , you could not be more wrong .
we must reach an agreement , and a good one at that .
it must also answer the question : what do we wish to achieve together ?
we are pleased to see that this has been possible .
we consider this to be an essential point .
we need progress here .
we hope that the french presidency will be able to propose a framework directive on this subject .
who does what ?
that is precisely the problem !
i hope that the french presidency will take due account of this issue , which we consider to be extremely important .
there is a lot one can agree with .
what was the reason for its action ?
i would like to make one last point regarding the european union 's role in the international institutions .
we support these proposals .
that is precisely the problem with several words that are used in the current debate .
i will end here .
let us focus on the task in hand .
our position is quite clear .
the first problem with this issue is the agenda , which i think would be difficult to set at this stage .
we hope that we will have a large response .
thank you very much .
it is very important that the government should respect their decisions .
its main sectors of cooperation are agriculture , health and education .
thank you very much for your kind words .
we have them to thank for the fact that we were able to take action over there .
thank you very much , minister
the debate is closed .
the french presidency has already proposed four initiatives to the council .
unfortunately , however , they do exist .
unfortunately they are nothing new .
i believe that we have the responsibility to establish a legal framework which will allow this to be done .
i hope that the commission will do everything that the commissioner has said and that the council is up to the job .
in that case they will have the support of this parliament .
it is high time we adopted policy .
mr president , there has been enough talk .
it is time for action !
how then , can we put an end to this ?
that is the question .
so what is to be done ?
this means that , in six months , you will have to draw up a report on what you have achieved .
they cannot go back .
what you do not see , however , is any action on our part .
but these are not enough .
the debate is closed .
i would still like to answer some of the questions put to me during the debate .
the debate is closed .
life
however we should also discuss all the other expenditure ; at least discuss it , even if we cannot agree .
our committee tabled two amendments for the report .
therefore we have prepared the opinion which is before parliament .
it is a matter that has been of significant concern to the industry committee .
that is only just now coming through .
firstly , i will refer to our contribution to the international organisations .
my second point concerns the international agreements .
no more , no less .
let us get that point clear .
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
that is no way to make progress .
ladies and gentlemen , i do not know if the council is aware of the real situation .
question time ( council )
thank you , minister , for your first response during your presidency .
council .
should the motion for a resolution be put to the vote , the council has agreed that the member states that are part of this commission would vote in favour of it .
that is the question .
i consider that unacceptable , it is not my responsibility .
the council has decided not to answer them .
there is no problem between parliament and the commission .
and here i am not talking as president-in-office of the council but as a government minister .
parliament will consider this issue , but today we are not going to discuss it further , if the members agree .
subject : international criminal court
russia and the united states are important in this connection .
i wish you every success .
the next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
this is going towards the needs of a common foreign and security and defence policy .
this is considered a priority by the committee responsible , the committee on budgets and parliament itself .
we need 20 million .
allow me to make one comment to the council .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i have nothing much to add in principle to what has already been said .
we too shall , of course , be voting in favour of the two reports .
thank you , commissioner .
thank you .
the debate is closed .
we want to ensure that this remains the case .
that is an important point in this process .
then there are two more points which i should like to address .
energy , of course , is not just any good or service .
nevertheless they should have been implemented on time by every member state and they were not .
i hope that will be supported .
it is up to them to decide .
this is currently something that we should be concerned about .
i do not favour price reduction over security .
energy is a basic need .
access to it must therefore be considered a fundamental right .
that is the first thing .
i do not think that it , in fact , is .
that is just the problem with this issue .
this does not mean that there is not a strong will to move forward .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
so what are our most important proposed amendments ?
that does not present any particular problem .
the council needs to take serious account of parliament 's views .
this compromise is welcome but it is not enough ; we need to go further and account needs to be taken of parliament 's position if we are to do so .
that must change , and i believe it will .
this step is also the step currently proposed by the council .
i speak for my own country of ireland .
i could not agree more .
that is what we want , that is what we need and that is what we shall vote for .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i should like to address one more point .
but we also want to guarantee high training standards ; high standards guarantee progress and are in the interests of all our citizens .
this is extremely important .
and the situation is all the more serious if we consider the unemployment levels in europe .
but people no longer understand this .
is this a citizens ' europe ?
is this a common market ?
these are the questions .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i shall look into this .
( the minutes were approved )
mr president , i wanted to bring up an issue which should be of great concern to this parliament , and in particular to members of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the committee on budgetary control .
mr president , i would like to put a question to parliament .
secondly , the euro is a new currency .
i hope to see better coordination between european policies .
we want to apply the treaty , but the whole treaty and nothing but the treaty .
those are the main points i would like to make .
i very much hope that we will continue to apply the criteria of the treaty , no more and no less .
"
however , more could be done to improve the transparency of monetary policy .
after all , full employment is once again a possibility at last .
( applause )
i would like to have seen all these points included in the report .
the lack of any real coordination between our economic policies is the main cause .
and then , mr president , allow me to question you on one final point .
( applause )
there has to be more transparency , however .
could you comment on that later on in your reply ?
this is also important .
mr president , mr president of the european central bank , good work !
for all of these reasons , mr president of the european central bank , i would like to congratulate you and show you my support .
but what is vital is that the people across europe have a debate about the future , a debate about political union .
there are a few points i would like to comment on .
the debate is closed .
but there still remains a very great deal to be done .
for the reason mentioned , this particularly needs to be brought to the attention of the council again .
it was very successful at that point .
this has not happened during this new parliamentary term .
that is my first point .
unfortunately , this seems to apply not only to the public , but also to business .
we must all do this together , at all levels of the european union !
i certainly wish the euro well .
vote
the help of the eu is required for this .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
this has also been the case this time .
as i see it , that is the vital question .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
procedure without debate
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament approved the joint text )
before the vote :
before the vote :
madam president , i will have the opportunity later to speak on behalf of my group .
president .
in this respect , we believe that we have taken an important step .
madam president , that would be a step forward .
madam president , i believe the document that is before us today is a very significant document .
my group is very concerned about the developments that are under way in the council .
secondly , we too have a comment for the council .
i would now like to turn to some of the key provisions of the agreement .
madam president , my group is to vote against the framework agreement .
( applause
( parliament adopted the framework agreement )
i should like , if you will allow me , to make two basic comments .
there are clear amendments on our order paper today which deal with that point .
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , of course i voted for the motion .
i also welcome the fact that the amendments relating to the objectives of the programme have been approved , as has the compromise proposal for a new programme .
that is why i have not voted in favour of any of his proposed amendments .
they result from the lack of funds provided to public health services .
this is why i have naturally voted against .
i hope that other member states will follow france 's example .
this report can be used as a basis for further action .
2 .
first of all , i wanted to vote against amendment no 11 .
it is not certain that the new compromise proposal will be as good as this was .
i voted against the committee proposal along with other members of my group .
will it be possible to take them to court ?
i therefore have two demands to make of the commission .
with regard to the member states , i can tell you that next week i will present the commission with a report on the practical application of the euro .
this is the reason why we believe that we must pay special attention to companies during this period , as well as to citizens .
i would like to make some comments relating to the various points mentioned in the debate .
this will clearly happen , as long as those countries want it to happen .
two additional comments .
of course , we will have to debate them in the future , when we discuss the budgets for the coming years .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
in this scientific assessment , it is a concern for young children 's health that is being expressed .
as the rapporteur , i share the concerns of the members of parliament in my committee .
this is of interest to all of us , certainly .
it is quite unacceptable that we can get into a situation in which we are going to reduce the level of safety for our children .
we have enough information to make the necessary decisions .
this is a principle which should apply to all consumer protection , but particularly protection in relation to children .
they are entirely within their rights , of course .
no , we do not .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
after the first reading in parliament , the council approved a common position .
i will now comment on the amendments .
we are not prepared to do that .
let us hear them .
this is where we need to get to .
the main thing is that consumers need to be able to make sense of it .
there are two very different issues here .
and when he says that we in this house have brought forward the date it is to come into force .
he is quite right !
i would welcome some comments from the commissioner on that point .
the commission 's proposal will lead to our having to deal with the system again before long .
i also hope consumer organisations will give their strong support to the implementation of the provisions in practice .
the question for consumers will be this : what information can we expect ?
we are all concerned about public health and consumer protection .
that is not the case in my country .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i am sure there are still many more questions .
in this context i would like to ask you , commissioner , what progress the other member states have made .
this is not acceptable .
i am therefore pleased that this regulation has been adopted .
it is not even a food safety issue .
so they know what they have to do .
this took place on 3 may .
so it will certainly not be possible to put the new proposal into practice .
that is the effect it would have .
i do not therefore believe that this new proposal would improve or add to information for consumers .
that is all .
that is what this is about , and that alone !
you see , it can work !
mr president , i would like firstly to congratulate the commissioner .
that possibility - that is the reality at the moment - will continue to exist .
i would like to ask him four questions .
would this cause a real problem ?
is that a problem ?
perhaps i may deal with them one by one .
question time ( commission )
first part
there are quite different , important concerns to be taken into account .
what is the commission 's view of the position of these member states in any future eu defence cooperation ?
mr president , commissioner , i thank you for your full reply .
as i said , i do not think it is necessary to have any treaty change .
this is one of our current objectives .
second part
the way the money is being used is decided by the council of the parliament after being voted by the members .
so this is something we are giving quite some attention to .
why ?
a little more than eur 10 million are currently under implementation .
so we are quite pleased .
i should like to point out that several of the least developed countries benefit from both regional policy funds and the cohesion fund .
that is one part of my reply .
that is our problem .
the most important thing is to set up management authorities and , as a matter of priority , the management authority for the community support framework .
this law is based on the provisions included in the community support framework .
but the question remains .
there is an application before the court .
i should like to put two questions to you .
i think that a common strategy would be needed to deal with these issues .
that is actually what i was after in the question that i raised .
the commission may have information on the extent of the problem in the member states .
all that , however , is not enough , in my view .
it really is an essential instrument .
perhaps the amendments we adopted in the environment committee go too far .
account can , therefore , already be taken of special cases or special problems .
allow me to turn now to the individual amendments .
thank you , madam commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i shall close there - my time is up in any case .
we should also like to congratulate the rapporteur .
the question which remains is whether or not we want to go further than what has been accepted in the common position .
the question we always need to ask ourselves as european institutions is : why is this one of our concerns ?
as you perhaps know , the commission has now , in the course of the week , adopted a new directive which will further improve access to environmental information .
i turn finally to amendment 4 , which concerns an important issue .
the debate is closed .
why do they not know ?
we need the kind of directive that the environment committee would like to see .
the question obviously is why we have not had that before .
there is also a question for member states .
action is taken .
they pay the price for that .
the second issue is the clear conflict here between the parliament and the council .
we have a lot of these and we really want to achieve something .
we want to see results .
the debate is closed .
here we have a proposal by the committee on budgets .
ladies and gentlemen , i must ask for your cooperation .
thank you very much , mr president .
that is why we are going to support her .
it is therefore extremely important .
i wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and say that i support her proposals and her objectives .
the debate is closed .
i do wish to point out , however , that in some areas we have proposed amendments which we consider to be extremely important .
the first of these , as so often , concerns the budget .
we need two additional instruments .
the second area is the question of the legal basis .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing a very important report here today .
this is always the case ; there is never enough money for culture or for education .
why do i , or my colleagues in the legal affairs committee , see a connection between these things ?
the council should be called to account here .
i do not think that i need speak for my full two minutes if i can focus on these two points .
we should like more money , and we should like this addition to the legal basis .
the funding of support programmes is not the only issue here .
this programme does not even take production into account .
that must change .
i think not .
firstly , why do we need this programme ?
why do we need it ?
i believe we are able to do that .
i do not think this is the case .
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on the work that she has done .
there are some things that the public sector cannot do and some things the market cannot do .
that certainly is an area that is proposed in this report and is a responsibility at a european level .
so , ladies and gentlemen , what is the commission 's position on the proposed amendments ?
mr president , i have the list of amendments available .
i can make the list of these amendments available , mr president .
so i need not go over it again .
so i do not think we should go that far .
the debate is closed .
i would therefore call on the council to come up with a proposal for a common position within the short term .
finally , we reached general agreement in the committee on a large number of amendments .
this is why this should also be included in this report .
that will then be a good time to consider a possible increase in the funding .
where are those young people going to come from ?
what are those standards ?
how have they been established ?
let me just come back to a point that i raised myself in an amendment .
but of course there is a price to pay for that .
we shall vote on our report tomorrow .
that is already the case .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
has he no respect ?
i think that is a very good idea and quite right .
( the minutes were approved )
welcome
thank you for your attention .
i wish to express our thanks .
that is , of course , also true in the european institutions .
i believe that we will be able to draft joint reports on the most important problem areas .
there are therefore not even any amendments .
i would just like to comment on an important statement which has not received due attention .
in that he has our full support .
i would like to make one more important point .
thank you for your work !
it is simply not good enough .
are there sufficient resources for the work to be carried out well ?
the commission takes a very positive view of this work .
it is true that we sometimes take a long time to reply .
i should like to stress that this draft regulation is now before parliament .
the committee work can start .
this is now before parliament .
the debate is closed .
the council of transport ministers needs to take a political decision to address this .
we cannot put it off any longer .
it needs attention now .
that may be right for us .
it may be wrong for others .
this cannot last any longer .
we must address this issue now .
nor is that in any way a problem .
we are all agreed that member states need to finally decide for themselves what they want do .
we are all agreed on this , and i therefore hope that we can make good progress .
why ?
but what is the value of such a measure ?
but that is not what is being proposed .
we need to consider the future of the sector for the reasons set out above .
it is a clear problem that we need to address .
what do these people get up to , i ask myself ?
mr president , i would also like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report .
first of all , the matter of safety .
of course , there still remains much to be done .
this is something we must never put up with .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
there is a considerable need to improve the legislation .
i very much agree with the rapporteur about this .
we have a good example of this here .
i am not so sure .
i think we have an example here of the commission 's doing all too little in this area .
we must know whether the legislation is working .
it should not be left to the individual member states .
this is completely unacceptable !
every member state should have full responsibility and the right to make its own decisions regarding its social security systems .
i hope that parliament will adopt this amendment .
but in general it is not a health and safety agenda .
i have taken note of your request .
vote
so i would ask that we adopt this document today .
once again , many thanks for your cooperation !
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the draft resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this has not been the case today .
that was your proposal , which was carried !
( applause )
then the amendments could not be adopted .
the commission cannot accept the other amendments .
commission . ( de ) the commission cannot accept amendment 4 .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i ask you to take note of that .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
president .
mr president , i respect your decision .
in any case , this is not the appropriate time to discuss this subject .
that is a decision that was taken .
what do they want to know ?
workers should receive even greater protection .
it is a waste of time .
this is not the case .
if it is accepted , we must follow the procedure through and the debate must take place .
we now have new information , which we need to take into account .
why did it happen ?
we created dialogue .
we are well aware , however , that the true cause is not just that .
the concerns expressed are very real .
the joint debate is closed .
there is no reason not to do here what we did there , what many of us did in those days .
in our opinion , it is essential for parliament to speak out against the world bank 's decision .
i would like to address the commissioner and say that i hope that the commission has very good relations with the representatives of the world bank .
decisions must , of course , be made by no later than tomorrow .
human rights
iraq
madam president , commissioner , one could say a lot about this issue .
i would ask the house to support this resolution .
madam president , i am really pleased that this resolution has come about .
i hope that this will encourage the commission and the member states to act on this issue .
such action is a matter of great priority .
this is our urgent request .
in the text of the resolution , reference was made to this state .
germany set a good example in this respect .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
this is the best approach to take on the matter .
iraq
he is still there ten years later .
this was wrong and unacceptable .
i hope that this house will vote in favour of this resolution .
it is extremely important .
first , we want to address not just the council and the commission but also the united nations security council .
allow me to be more specific .
mr president , i have to reply on five issues , on the commission 's behalf .
that is all .
we thank the commissioner who does not want to speak .
the debate is closed .
firstly , i would ask that aid should reach the people and groups who are most in need of it .
at the moment we know that the commission has the possibility , the means and the resources , to provide more aid .
the results are now before us .
in a few days ' time we will forward a communication to the council on the measures to be supported and the funding to be provided .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
he should be pleased about that , as i and many others are .
"
the main thing is to make it clear and today we are not clear .
we cannot have two different procedures being applied in the same week .
i fully understand what you are saying .
it seems to me that he is absolutely right .
i do not want any further debate .
we will look into this matter .
vote
mr president , on a point of order .
if we vote for them would this actually take the report further away from what this house is allowed to vote on ?
i would like to hear whether this is actually a legal procedure for us to be voting on now .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
this is certainly a positive measure .
we shall not give up .
or for some other purpose ?
i would be extremely concerned if this were the case .
what has the european commission proposed ?
i therefore hope that my proposal will be taken into account when the document is implemented .
we have therefore voted against this report .
it is all the more unacceptable , given that there are still problems !
the energy sector is crucial to the economic development of a country and vital to its defence .
although that is true , it is not a sufficient reason .
this will not change a great deal in the short term .
money is something in which it is necessary to have confidence .
that just goes to show !
the current proposals do not address this problem .
it is for all these reasons that i voted against this report .
let this remain a national issue !
"
i hope the commission will take such points into serious consideration when developing policy in the area .
that is the problem .
i expect the commission to look into this matter .
mr president , first of all i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report .
we can see the different problems quite clearly from different areas of the european union .
each area has its own particular problem .
but we have to ensure that we get the balance right .
there are , however , two points in your report that i have a problem with .
but it is doing well .
let us all do it together , the commission will certainly do its best .
civil dialogue
the european commission has been aware of this for three years .
this is not the issue .
this is the serious concern which we have in our committee .
this is the problem , in fact , and i would ask the commissioner whether it would be possible to give this matter further attention within the commission .
as we know , we have been discussing the issue for years .
they make us think of new things and they are essential to our process .
that is my first comment .
we shall make progress in the social sector because we know that we have to make progress in terms of cooperation in that sector .
we need time for this .
but words are not enough and two years after the 1998 budget crisis , the difficulties continue .
mr president , that has to change .
that is quite fundamental .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
however , this was not , in my opinion , a point of order .
mr president , i just wanted to say something about the minutes , although it is not yet time for them to be approved .
this will be done .
it is not the first time that it has been discussed .
vote
in particular , we will have to develop joint investment programmes .
i would stress the fact that the public authorities have a major role to play at regional level , as well as national and european level .
however , we still have a long way to go .
how is this to happen ?
that is extremely important .
finally , i just want to say that we are on the way to taking joint action to protect the environment .
this framework decision is one step , like the council of europe 's convention on the protection of the environment through criminal law .
i am in favour of the framework decision and of the amendments which have been tabled .
there is therefore a crucial need for joint action by the member states in order to protect the environment under criminal law .
it is important to have regulations in criminal law so that we can prevent environmental crime .
moreover it is not just companies .
i believe that this is a direction in which we must go but i would also like to make one additional point .
i think that this will be an important task for the commission .
these problems certainly exist in a number of member states , and there are certainly many different reasons for this .
if that is the case , then that is , of course , quite unacceptable .
obviously , this is , in the first place , a responsibility of the member states , and there should be international cooperation in this area .
coordination as a result of this initiative is , of course , also necessary .
this cannot be allowed to continue .
it is important that we have legislation in place to protect us against serious environmental crime before we see further enlargement of the european union .
i am in no doubt about this .
of course , the commission takes the view that this must be developed further .
this is also included .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
"
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
statement by the president
- madam president , unfortunately i cannot agree with what you have said .
a part of reality is not sufficient by itself .
madam president , on a point of order .
i would ask you to speak to air france .
i am yet to receive any reply in this regard .
this will be the appropriate opportunity for you to state your case .
they do have freedom of speech .
to reply to what you said to me , the regulations are already in place .
these are therefore important matters .
agenda
the next item is the order of business .
madam president , i would like to speak against this proposal .
i want to make two points absolutely clear .
( applause )
our citizens need it and so does parliament .
we are not about to start a debate on this matter . i shall put this proposal to him .
since this is a very important issue , a statement from the commission president would obviously be even better .
president .
madam president , before the vote i should like to make a point of order .
i believe this to be a matter of great importance .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i shall then give my opinion of the proposed regulation , as well as the report as a whole .
many reasons have been given for this .
we agree absolutely with this .
of course , the council and parliament cannot expect the commission to do things which they do not give it the power to do .
in this regard you have our support , commissioner .
)
this is what is important for the development of relations between the european parliament and the countries of this area of the world .
it would be good to move on from here .
this is not what i want to happen to you .
we have no clear policy on this issue .
i would like to end with a reference to the agricultural sector .
. i am extremely pleased to be able to comment on these two important reports on one of the most significant programmes for which we are responsible .
we believe this is something for the council and the commission to consider together .
let me make two final points .
the joint debate is closed .
a common military force is being created .
we have therefore tabled a number of amendments which we hope parliament can accept .
i hope that others will also support these amendments .
what is the real issue here ?
unfortunately , the report does not address these issues .
these are the real questions .
does this really amount to nothing more than a coordination problem ?
we also need policies .
this is all about competition .
there is an urgent need for this .
is this not already clear to them under the framework of the common foreign and security policy ?
what is this really about ?
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
community humanitarian activities
the first is a question of principle .
i believe that there is a considerable need for action here in the future .
in this respect , the commission and the council 's budgetary proposals are far from meeting what we believe to be the humanitarian needs .
mr president , throughout the world , development aid is giving way to humanitarian aid .
that is important .
i do not come entirely new to the debate on these issues .
the honourable member 's report will make a significant contribution to that .
the debate is closed .
welcome
it is important , however , that they continue to have value .
naturally i very much agree with what the president-in-office has just said .
that is our position .
we will continue to do all we can to achieve this .
what we can we in the european union do ?
the united states alone cannot provide this guarantee .
but that is not enough .
this is the price for peace .
peace is necessary .
what role , therefore , can the european union play ?
what can the european union do in this context ?
i heard a call for a summit meeting here .
eu external action priorities
it will work especially hard to have the regulation on the economic and social development of turkey adopted .
the union now has the instruments which it needs in order to apply a common foreign policy .
finally , its financial resources , our financial resources , are considerable .
those , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , are the priorities of the french presidency as regards external action .
any such discussion should of course begin with the treaty .
what does that mean in practice for the commission ?
that is important in the council and it is important in the parliament because you are the budgetary authority .
according to the treaty , the european parliament is responsible for the area of civil crisis management , trade policy and the like , and that is clearly the case .
only , we must have the good sense to bring about a certain amount of coordination between them .
i believe we will find the right moment to make a start on this .
i can make this programme available to you .
we all know what the problem is .
vote
( parliament approved the resolution )
it is a very good report on an important subject .
( parliament approved the legislative resolution )
what are you doing to help us ?
"
"
this is unacceptable !
i do not think so .
are there any comments ?
" actually there is no mention of what i said .
( the minutes were approved )
agenda
we would welcome a positive response from the council and commission with regard to this new policy in these matters too .
we welcome the commitment to an urgent review of that process .
the commission must have a strong role to play in this process .
i should like quickly to ask the president-in-office two questions .
my second question is this .
in the united states there is currently a great debate taking place concerning defence expenditure .
but in this short speech , i want to focus on enlargement .
the european parliament will play an important part in this .
that is what this is all about !
we need to ask ourselves how we can prevent this .
we therefore now need to discuss the different issues .
in what form will the european union be present and at what level ?
mr president-in-office , this morning you mentioned the report parliament has asked me to present on turkey 's accession process .
if so , i can support this .
but how much real responsibility will they have ?
there is work to be done , and work is being done .
many thanks , commissioner .
that is the positive side .
the council needs to get its act together on this issue .
we have a joint role in this matter .
i will start with the european court of justice .
i shall now move on to the economic and social committee .
the same applies to the committee of the regions .
there is not a great deal to add here .
so far , so good .
the commissioner made the same point .
this no longer has a great deal to do with serious budgetary management .
its aim is to reduce expenditure .
new commitment is necessary .
money is not enough , however .
the debate is closed .
france will do everything possible to ensure that it can be in place before the end of this presidency .
thank you , madam president .
we have already discussed it three times in parliament .
of course we shall take their opinion into account before our final proposal .
nor , in my view , should they try to do that .
that is not the case at all .
this is in the interests of our citizens as well as industry .
europe and the european economy are doing well .
i do hope this time is the last time .
this would be the best way forward .
this is a key point .
mr president , minister , commissioner , i would like to put this debate into context .
and all for what ?
i put two questions to colleagues .
i think not .
i am sure it would .
the first is the political one and the second is the technical one .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
you know that we have very little time .
since they deal with the same subject , question nos 1 and 2 will be taken together .
that is an important priority for the french presidency .
the council does not have any response to this question at this stage .
and if so , when ?
this is what we wish to do for the european union .
the fact is , however , that we still have a few years to consider the matter .
the commission will present its proposal on the implementation of a single financial framework at a later date .
i do not have a specific answer on this issue .
that is the general rule .
in order for turkey to become a member of the european union , it must respect its values and therefore make the necessary efforts .
this is a crucial issue of democracy .
i understand the concerns behind the honourable member 's question .
i would thank the president of the council for that answer .
economic and social development of turkey
today , i shall simply come to the main conclusion .
i am able to support him on behalf of my group , and i believe it must be possible to reach an agreement with the council .
is there really a problem here ?
then it is one for parliament to deal with .
he is aware of the problems of this country and of the people who live there .
at the very end of the day , turkey will benefit from these reforms being put into practice .
however , i should like to make a few comments .
and i think that the main issue is precisely this process and this road .
that will only come about when basic political , economic and social reforms have been implemented .
the debate is closed .
secondly , consider the level at which decisions are made .
where the issue of technology is concerned , we need increasing cooperation among the member states at european level .
and we certainly do not want a legal framework , where the powers that be set the rules .
the issue of the work 's content concerns us all .
but what does this mean ?
this was the right way for things to happen and it is right that they should remain that way .
however , i believe that we still have a lot to do on certain points , both in the commission and in parliament .
i am sure that that is not what we want .
to that extent , the commission 's communication still does not go far enough .
the european industry must be able to make the most of these opportunities .
progress has already been made , however , in the past ten years .
a change has therefore already taken place .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but there are a few that i have a great deal of interest in .
so i really wanted to keep that in my report .
i look forward to my new labour colleagues voting on this particular matter .
i think that making equal opportunities available to young people is quite important for us all .
what conclusions can we draw from this ?
i think that in future , i will once again have to request the help of all the national and regional authorities in this area .
so let us all work together so that there will be a large number of them in future .
the debate is closed .
fisheries agreements
the next item is the joint discussion of the following reports :
the commission and the rapporteur have done some good work .
but that is not enough .
there is something to be said for this alone .
perhaps he could give an answer when he comments on the debate later on .
where your amendments are concerned , i should like to make it clear that the commission can in principle accept the first two of these .
many thanks for your attention .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( applause )
europe has always had an important role to play throughout the world .
there is not such a great price to pay for peace , so let us pay it !
today is better than tomorrow " .
nevertheless the day will come .
europe for us is democracy .
europe for us is culture .
europe for us is responsibility for the environment .
europe for us is economy .
the negotiations today , difficult as they are , are very good negotiations .
how can he go home ?
there is not a great deal more that i wish to say .
the time for that has come .
everyone will do what they think best .
i wish to congratulate her on that .
this has been a matter of some debate within the committee .
thank you for your attention .
the commission has taken this resolution forward .
there is , after all , a great deal to be considered .
immigration is not a problem .
as far as we are concerned , the proposal under discussion is unacceptable .
( applause from the right )
that is the crucial problem we face with this directive .
that is the fact of the matter .
i should like to thank all the members who have taken part in the debate .
this is not a matter of going back on a question of principle .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is the context in which i wish to place this debate .
i should like to congratulate the rapporteur .
secondly , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
within the framework of this debate , i should like to home in on four specific points .
it is not too much to ask .
either we have a european union based on law or we do not .
it is a very good report .
we are currently working on this .
the debate is closed .
environmental effects of certain programmes
this possibility was not mentioned at all in the committee 's discussion .
all member states voted for the common position , but some made it clear that they would go very little further than that .
we must try to create a system in which we think in environmental terms from the very beginning , even when it comes to economic problems .
this is a major and important issue .
in this connection i have to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
this is completely unacceptable , and that is precisely how i see it .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we can go along with this .
i believe we are in a position to congratulate each other today .
this is an important step .
that is the real principle that is being brought into play here for the first time .
that much is absolutely clear .
if there is no monitoring , there is no point in having any regulations .
it is a step forward .
it also has to be said that what we have achieved today is a compromise .
in my view , it remains to be seen what effects this will have .
if they cannot do it on that , what is to say they will do it on this ?
i am among those who welcome this compromise .
however , it will be extremely important to follow up the proposal .
we are , therefore , taking a great step forward today .
the debate is closed .

but once a text has been tabled , it is up to any members who wish to do so to adopt it .
this has always been the case in this house .
joint motion for a resolution on eu external action priorities
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the start of the vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
despite this , my group has voted in favour because this regulation is better than nothing .
it was clear that the council would not accept such a proposal .
it is a necessary step , but it does not go far enough .
"
of course , countries who are in need of aid should receive assistance , but , on the other hand , it is appropriate to ask them to respect these principles first .
that is why i voted for these amendments .
we say no to this .
this is why i voted for this report .
the best we can do now is to back the amendments proposed by the european commission .
why ?
unfortunately , this amendment was not adopted .
in my view , that is not a good move .
this is an unacceptable situation .
you are therefore free to go .
i do not understand the problem .
eu external action priorities
are there any comments ?
i did not state that .
it was just a possibility , not a statement .
that is important .
is that clear ?
that was the problem .
right now there is no problem .
we adopt the minutes .
that is all .
( the minutes were approved )
that is extremely important .
we welcome the position that you have taken on this particular issue .
we must provide all citizens with access to this new information society .
in europe , we must ensure that there is security , because that is a human right .
we therefore support the commission 's proposals and we would like to draw attention to this aspect .
may i welcome the commissioner to parliament today on behalf of all of us .
this is indeed one of our key concerns .
the debate is closed .
i wish to ask a question regarding the agenda .
when will the debate on this subject be held ?
the commission is working on a programme here too .
( applause )
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i wish we did not have to have this debate today .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
that is the key objective .
( applause )
i therefore especially welcome his statement today .
( applause )
nothing is more important than this .
this is not serious enlargement work .
despite being asked to do so , you were not prepared to be more specific at the time .
then you will have us all on your side .
madam president , first of all , i would like to answer a number of specific questions that have been put to me .
there are no further decisions to be made on the subject , the matter is closed .
( applause )
they are people .
this is less than two years ago .
this is completely wrong .
and i do not think that is something you would want .
that is all very well , but it is not enough !
the appropriate parliamentary committee must therefore get down to work as quickly as possible .
what is this really about ?
that is why parliament must use its power to act .
could they not provide new life ?
this debate concerns the whole of society .
you have called for one and we agree .
that was the first comment i wanted to make .
i feel as many other people do about this issue .
there is no need for us to take action at present .
we still have time .
what does respect for life mean ?
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
commissioner , i am pleased to hear that certain measures are to be taken .
the commission made a clear assessment of this issue .
thank you , commissioner , for your answer .
something must be done .
second part
if such issues are brought to my attention and come within the relevant directive , then action can be taken .
what are your views on this ?
considerable progress has been achieved so far .
thank you very much , commissioner .
secondly , you said we would have the results by the end of 2001 .
i want to focus on one thing . i want to ask you a specific question so as not to have a long discussion about this .
they are now saying that the state will have to pay it back which is not acceptable either .
mr president , there is really nothing i can add to that .
you are right in principle .
water policy
in which areas has significant progress been made ?
the water framework directive now needs to be put into effect .
more needs to be done about this .
the member states have been called upon to improve the quality of our water quickly in order to achieve the objectives in 15 years ' time .
this should be provided for by law .
i agree with the rapporteur : it is only through cooperation that success can be achieved .
will we achieve this objective ?
we shall nevertheless pay close attention to the way this policy is implemented in practice in the years to come .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i believe it will do so .
that is the crucial thing .
mr president , the compromise that has been reached is a great success for environmental and consumer protection .
once this decision has been made , the position in a few years ' time will be quite close to what we had wanted to achieve .
mr president , it is true that the legislative procedure has been long and difficult , and i have said so .
many thanks , mr president .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
air transport and the environment
others do just the same thing .
national governments must take action now .
what conditions must european legislation meet ?
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for her report .
there are specific reasons for this , but something must be done about the matter .
we cannot accept this .
however , we finally reached a majority agreement .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is the road we should be going down .
i would ask you to consider that this does not yet mean the end of the negotiations .
mr president , i welcome this proposal .
the consumer is always the one that has to pay .
now , at the second reading , 4 amendments have been tabled .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i should like to refer to just two of them .
that is the purpose of amendment no 3 .
the amendments to this report were tabled by myself .
that is the purpose of my amendments , to which a large majority of the committee agreed .
this applies to amendment no 5 of the committee on the environment .
we wish to carry on the dialogue with parliament .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
many thanks for your attention .
this is not true !
what should we do ?
this subject has already been taken up in the debate .
it is precisely because this is such a crucial issue that i should like to make two comments .
what is to be done ?
therefore i especially welcome parliament 's initiative in taking up this issue now .
parliament also seems to share the view that the main action has to be taken at the level of member states .
we are working with the member states to ensure that this is so .
we welcome parliament 's support in this .
this we have done with the communication in 1998 and we will continue to do so .
changes take time .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , the honourable member 's request concerns a matter of importance .
the next item is the joint debate on :
we need cohesion throughout the union .
france has decided to make this a priority of its presidency .
recent events show that we still have a long way to go .
for a number of years , and until a few days ago , we had received no reply .
they too will be making proposals .
in fact , we have already heard this morning that it is a priority for the french presidency , the council and also for the commission .
i welcome the statement made by the commissioner , which has our support .
therefore , i think that the commission should act .
therefore , keep going , commissioner .
there is the system , and then there is the individual too .
as far as regulation is concerned , it is not up to europe to make the rules .
i would like to know whether you have a response to this .
why ?
why ?
so i think that everyone has a job to do here .
the reports we have before us also provide a basis for debate .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i believe that this debate and the reports are both a step in the right direction .
let me stress that i am saying a part .
i believe that this is extremely important .
the second level is that of the national authorities .
( applause )
i do not think so .
that is not our aim .
( applause )
( applause )
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
vote
( parliament approved the joint text )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
with the eu framework directive on water resources we will once again see individual countries going their own way .
that will be a vital step and i hope our parliament will be able to follow the same line as today .
that is real progress .
for all these reasons , i voted for this text .
we cannot just content ourselves with this debate .
i am extremely pleased about the decision taken .
and i think that this resolution makes it clear that human life must not become a kind of consumer item .
quite obviously , i think not .
at any rate , we hope so .
that is not the case with the resolutions put to the vote today .
i will , of course , take part in it and give my views .
mr president , i would like to thank the members who voted for my report .
i hope that this will meet your concerns .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
at least , that has been the plan for years .
we have to see the reality for what it is .
this is what our resolution is about .
we think that there is a need to take urgent action .
it has been raised by five members in this house and he has not said anything about it .
is it that he does not know what to do ?
the debate is closed .
every effort must be made in order to ensure that the new negotiations are a success .
the debate is closed .
human rights
that is what we are doing here today .
that is not much .
that , ladies and gentlemen , is the report you adopted .
that is the question i wanted to ask you .
i hope that will change .
that is the situation .
so i think we should ask ourselves a few questions .
unfortunately that is not the case .
all these people are in an unacceptable situation .
i also believe that the european union could do a lot more .
that should be supported .
we will continue to concern ourselves with that situation .
in that situation , there are various groups who use violence .
there is really not very much this parliament can do .
i believe that this should have been part of the resolution .
so what can we do ?
war will never lead to peace .
the answer is no .
i will not go back over that but i do want to give my opinion here .
a number of eu member states have made the same commitment .
it is our responsibility to prevent it .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
i cannot vote for this policy .
the safety of europe 's citizens and , thus , confidence in the community should be a priority for us all .
mr president , this issue should not even be a subject of urgent debate .
i should therefore quickly like to say three things .
my last , but important point , is one for the commission .
the joint debate is closed .
so what proposals can we make ?
what can the european union do ?
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
but this does not take away the fact that closed groups continue to live side by side without real integration .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
from our point of view , this is a key issue .
it is therefore a good cause .
what do we need now at the level of the european community ?
a year seems a short time for the project .
those are the people we must respect and encourage and support .
we can hear that especially from this discussion .
but now to the subject in hand .
this too is something we need to support by making this area a priority .
training and education are being seen more and more clearly as european resources .
that opportunity must be taken .
the commission services made the full text of this external assessment available to your rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i should therefore like to say that today 's vote has been very important .
i am therefore very pleased that we have adopted this report by a large majority .
the commission should therefore improve the quality of its reports in future .
thank you .
order of business
the following amendments to the agenda have been proposed :
the vote will therefore be held tomorrow .
however , something has to be done .
the member states now have to find a common approach in both the short and the long term .
for almost ten years , we have been trying to establish a common energy tax in the european union .
in so doing , they would also do europe what i think is a currently much needed service .
a word about monetary policy .
( applause from the right )
let us put more money in them .
that is all quite true .
there is more road transport than there was ten years ago .
there is no reason why they should be .
we can do all of these things .
we can use these opportunities .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i believe not .
as we will see , these are different aspects of the same problem .
the question is : can this system really guarantee effective protection ?
i do not think it can .
this is completely unacceptable .
the debate is closed .
why ?
for two quite crucial reasons .
this is particularly important in this case .
therefore we as a parliament support this .
i speak for some members on this side of the house in saying that there are concerns about this report .
we wish the commission well in this work .
the debate is closed .
mr president , the first question to be asked about this report is : why do we need this directive ?
how do they happen ?
what can we do to prevent them ?
but there is one fundamental point i would like to make .
safety measures are not the only things that cost .
we have the single currency .
this is not a question of whether or not health and safety at work is an important issue .
of course it is .
they ask : what are you doing for us ?
what shall we answer ?
this is the issue that we are discussing today .
i say : let it be now .
this should not be the priority for this house .
as my colleague has said , it is time for a change .
it is not .
the key issue of health and safety protection for workers is a matter of concern to us all .
these health and safety policies are the commission 's first priority in the social agenda .
i am particularly pleased with the comments she has made .
that is why the legislation is there and is to be applied across the european union .
the debate is closed .
competition rules
firstly , i welcome this process .
i know he has tabled amendments in relation to that .
which market do we mean ?
change was therefore necessary .
i would therefore ask you to vote in favour of these amendments .
the debate is closed .
that is important in our own countries , but we still have a long way to go throughout the european union .
that is a good thing , in my view .
on behalf of the commission , i wish to congratulate the rapporteur for his work on this regulation .
the debate is closed .
thus , we cannot aid countries that show no interest in their citizens ' human rights or democracy .
in fact the risk is considerable .
her report can , however , be considered to be an important contribution .
we certainly do not share this view .
this is not the first time we have discussed this issue in parliament , of course .
we agree that we now need to see results .
the commission has already taken the first step .
i agree .
from today the commission has a clear policy .
it is now up to the member states .
this is a very good decision .
we , in the commission , share your concern .
your support here will be crucial when the budgetary decisions have to be taken .
the support of parliament is also vital .
i do not think this is the case .
in conclusion , i should like to thank the rapporteur again for her excellent work .
the debate is closed .
many thanks , therefore , to the rapporteur and the european parliament , and i hope that the commission will improve its work in this area .
we back the amendments which have their interests in mind .
thank you very much for all the work you have put into the report .
i am extremely pleased with it .
the first point is agreements reached at wto level and the second one could be the budget .
the second point concerns the budget .
why ?
the fact remains that the agricultural policy is , in principle , there for the benefit of farmers .
mr president , thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to do so .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i speak first on behalf of the committee and will speak later on behalf of my group .
more work needs to be done in the area .
i now speak on behalf of my group , in respect of the amendments tabled by them and other political groups .
i hope that we will go further .
it has been a long and hard road .
i only do so when there is a reason .
let us agree on this report and then make changes in other areas as they come before us .
when it is time for change then it is the time for change and that time is now .
what we need to do tomorrow is to accept the committee 's report and move forward .
this action would , however , have two consequences for article 15 .
the debate is closed .
we have taken note of your opinion .
i cannot believe what is going on !
we will see what we can do .
we must go further in terms of european cooperation .
we have heard the commissioner 's statement .
today , thanks to this debate , they are a little less alone .
ladies and gentlemen , it is hard to return to the agenda , but we will have to do so .
it is important for a parliament to speak out in public on this kind of matter .
we have no others .
"
that is not true .
( applause )
( applause )
you are really democratic because you accept free speech .
the debate is closed .
and these , unfortunately , are the subject of our debate today .
we must be a role model .
we must make use of this opportunity and make a clear european contribution to this conference .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what is this debate actually about ?
the matter is far too serious for that .
' that is the question we must ask ourselves .
( applause from the left )
she has put a great deal of work into it .
the debate is closed .
we are pleased to see the work carried out by parliament .
mr president , i should like to thank the french presidency for its very clear statement .
one of these rights is the right to security for all .
this is how it goes .
i should also like to congratulate the french presidency on their statement to us .
the fight against this type of crime therefore requires urgent action .
the debate is closed .
no problem at all .
we , for our part , certainly are not .
vote
mr president , i would like to support the rapporteur 's motion .
mr president , on a point of order .
( parliament approved the request )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
on amendment no 12
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is not one such area .
legal protection must be provided as close to the citizens as possible .
it will always be essential for a system of this kind to be subject to democratic control .
' , you may ask , mr president .
and why is that ?
if that is your idea of a united europe , then that in itself is of great concern to me .
president .
president .
( parliament approved the request )
agenda
i will , of course , take note of your comment .
this really is the most appropriate time , when we are discussing the future of our fisheries policy on the basis of four reports , for the commission to make this statement .
it clearly is appropriate .
far from it . our group has also supported it .
this is why i propose an urgent debate on this matter .
therefore , if all members are in agreement , i would certainly wish to refer this matter to the committee on employment and social affairs .
i can see that this is the case .
i shall certainly take note of your comment .
the agenda is thus adopted .
madam president , on a point of order .
madam president , could we take this matter into consideration ?
this is not the first time .
madam president , on a point of order .
it is vital to do that .
the debate is closed .
our rapporteur also referred to this .
it should be anything but that .
so we are in favour , but there are two things we want to add .
firstly , we have to ensure that political control remains with the commission and parliament .
however , we would also wish to go further in a different direction .
i am with him on that one .
i , too , would like to see this happen .
this legislative process for which we all carry some responsibility , concerns us all , of course .
the debate is closed .
we congratulate the commissioner and the rapporteur on their work to achieve that .
we also all agree that education is rightly a matter for the individual member states and the regions .
we are making good progress with this important issue .
each one of us can ask the question how important common quality monitoring is in our own environment .
unfortunately , a great deal of resources are still needed in many countries in order to achieve this .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for her work .
there is more to it than that .
that is why i welcome this report .
education is an important , indeed crucial , part of society .
to everyone here at the european parliament and the commission , i hope that we continue to work on the same good terms as we have done in the past .
secondly , the role of european cooperation in this area .
the debate is closed .
the question of whether the european union has a task is not a question to me .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
all in all , it is fair to say that the commission has made every effort to meet the requirements of this parliament .
a serious start has been made on reforms .
however , i would like to point out - and that is also mentioned in the report - that although some progress has been made in five areas , they have a long way to go yet .
the more transparency , the better .
they were clearly set out last year .
once again , i thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on a job well done .
we are talking conditions , and not just comments .
this is also clearly brought out in the report , by the way .
commissioner , this is a matter for you .
i was there myself .
you have also mentioned this proposal again today .
naturally , there is a need for action .
so various areas come to mind .
it is high time the people were able to make use of it .
many thanks , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
these were the main concerns expressed .
so , as far as this is concerned , well done to the commission .
i believe that this is an extremely positive result .
it is important to stress one crucial point in relation to the international fund for ireland : this is not a european union programme .
is this having an impact on european aid ?
could something be done about this ?
his conditions of work were not the best .
that is something i can well understand . we cannot demand both better control and more of a free hand .
there is also the special peace programme from the european union itself .
there will certainly be a great deal to do in that area .
the commission used these measures as the basis for its own assessment .
we are simply doing our job .
that is not the point .
the debate is closed .
this particular report is concerned with funding programmes , which was an important initiative from this parliament a few years ago .
however , the commission did not reply .
we do not understand !
i speak not only on behalf of this report but also , i am sure , of other reports that need to go through the same system .
when national measures have no effect , that is when europe comes into play .
so that is very relevant to us in this house too .
perhaps the commission could comment on that at the close of the debate .
the growth and environmental initiative has not received any more funds .
this has , until now , not been the case .
urgent action is called for here .
the debate is closed .
the list goes on .
we have achieved a great deal , but there is still much to be done .
i would like to mention two .
i have included the above in an amendment .
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , on a point of order .
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is unacceptable .
that is why i voted in favour .
mr president , i voted against this report .
that is unacceptable .
i would say that this is a technical problem .
president .
"
1 .
2 .
3 .
4 .
5 .
we shall therefore be voting against the report in question and the relevant commission proposal .
mr president , i should like above all to thank the rapporteur for this report .
i therefore welcome your proposal to forward the resolution to the council .
the commission is not sure that it would be appropriate to propose such a legislative instrument .
finally , my comments on tax .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
what can be done about this ?
we can take legal measures to follow up implementation .
that needs the three i 's : information , integration and implementation , which should be the guidelines for the future .
in my opinion , there are three fundamental questions .
we can but hope .
well , these three reports before parliament today are a start .
perhaps we have to start to think about doing less but better .
i can understand to an extent , why you took the line you did .
nature simply will not allow it .
the same applies to a great deal of other legislation .
and this is legislation which we need for the future .
i should therefore like to ask the commission if it now has sufficient resources .
i should like to ask the house to accept these proposed amendments , because what we are trying to do here is to give the member states more responsibility .
finally , i should like to mention one more point , namely the candidate countries .
we did everything here which needed to be done even before there was a european directive .
we could do more on that .
it has been said that we need less but better legislative proposals .
i agree with that .
we know this from some of the member states .
we must not give in now , we have to carry on because we will finally start to see results .
we have to draw on that .
we can do more on education and information .
we try to use all these available instruments to improve implementation .
the debate is closed .
young farmers in the union
young farmers need greater access to production rights .
many thanks indeed go to him , then .
how can we help them ?
young farmers do indeed need urgent attention .
of course , we welcome the structural change but , at the same time , the extent of the change does give us cause for concern .
we have set standards .
today we need more quality and we need to consider the environment .
you have to address the problem within the situation in which young people find themselves today .
that is the way forward for the future .
but the point i want to make is that we need to do something now .
that is the problem we have to address and we must address it now .
i should also like to thank the committee on agriculture and rural development for its work .
measures to promote rural development are particularly important here .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
part i
but what is the problem , commissioner ?
they cannot expect the european commission to do it for them .
thank you for your answer .
i really must thank you for your answer .
as the honourable member points out , these issues of civil protection and civil defence are very important .
where is it to be found ?
the plan and the proposal already exist .
i believe we have made some good progress .
that cannot be done .
i wish i could answer that question .
the commission will present a communication to show how these guidelines have been taken into account .
if so , up to what level ?
let this be quite clear .
finally , i must say that the nuclear problem is a very serious problem , but it is under control .
i share your concern .
thank you , commissioner .
to date we do not have level of funding either from the eu or from the member states .
i have two other points .
but if you just say waste and that is all , then i will say no .
mr president , on a point of order . i want an answer to my question .
i am here to take the question .
i must request the answer to that question .
there is an order of questions .
?
but , of course , this is what we are going to support .
it is fully aware of the crucial role of development cooperation in this context .
common fisheries policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
that is what i should like to ask you , mr president .
thank you very much .
i think it is entirely appropriate .
we must understand this .
thank you , commissioner .
i believe that more progress can still be made .
review of the main areas of the union 's fisheries policy is called for throughout .
why was this the case ?
i believe you have done what it was within your power to do , which really was very little .
i hope that the commission will take the results of this work very seriously indeed .
things cannot go on like this .
mr president , 2001 is the year in which the commission is to draft a new common fisheries policy .
i doubt it very much .
mr president , how should and how will the european union 's common fisheries policy look after 2002 ?
a great many demands have been made on the commission .
i should like to single out just three of these basic problems .
this can only be good for debate .
i think that we need further discussion on three points in the report .
secondly , i should like to comment on the wto negotiations which you mention .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
this is why it is important for europe to give as much aid as possible .
so this is all very good
but we can , i believe , and we must do more .
we must encourage them to do so .
i come , then , to my third point , which the commissioner perhaps takes a rather different view of .
this is what i can report on this matter that was brought up in our discussion here .
let me once again thank you for this very positive debate .
the joint debate is closed .
this is the question we have to answer .
so much then , for information .
thank you for your attention .
you must give a reply here .
we did not receive any answer at that time .
i think this is necessary .
( applause )
there is , firstly , the human aspect of the problem .
( applause )
that is what we hope for from the council and from you .
( applause from the right )
and yet that is what we are doing today .
that is not our subject today .
we have a different subject to discuss .
( applause )
did the governments and the military know ?
it is up to the british government to make a statement on these matters .
first of all , the european union 's responsibility is towards the local population .
in my view , it should be the eu 's responsibility to look after the local population out there .
i do not think so .
for us too , it is a new experience to be discussing matters of security and defence policy in this way .
this also has to be said in such a debate .
mr president , just three points , because a great deal has already been said .
it would be rather difficult to provide you with information we do not have .
different means , and our assessment of them , change over time .
i have never done so and i would hope never to do so .
what i need to do is to ask you to accept your own responsibility .
mr president , on a point of order .
the debate is closed .
mr president , on a point of order .
i hope very much that parliament will support it , and i will come back to that .
so far , so good .
mr president , when things go wrong in a certain region , the world has come to expect ever more from europe , and rightly so .
we consider the commission 's initiative to be an important one .
this is the main reason why we cannot accept this report .
but how , and in what cases ?
what kind of coordination ?
let me deal with the amendments proposed by parliament .
madam president , i very much welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this extremely important subject .
dialogue is the way forward .
it is important for us to agree within the european union about what we are to do when we adopt a position on such measures .
thank you , minister .
the debate is closed .

after paragraph 2
mr president , i would now like us to vote on the paragraph all the same .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( applause )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i welcome these efforts and look forward to further progress in this regard .
" if only they had !
that is what we all want .
this is not true either .
to this end , the european union must make every effort to support the implementation of this directive .
i voted against the report .
but nothing is well with it .
that is precisely what we have to tell the young farmers .
they will focus in particular on young farmers .
nevertheless , three amendments which i tabled and which i believe to be important have been adopted . these are :
what can the european union do ?
it training must be set up .
the commission should adopt this resolution by the european parliament .
we can , of course , support all these points in principle .
" asked the general .
" said the president .
"
mr president , in times of war we have to make do , as they say .
however , only the future will decide the matter .
we must do all we can to encourage this change .
last but not least , the eu will continue to give every support to the un 's high commissioner for human rights .
we must congratulate ourselves in europe on some progress but not enough has been achieved .
i believe though that i should mention two or three of the particular problems of russia .
this is the basis not only for our internal work but also for our foreign policy .
i think this is an area to which we do not pay enough attention .
there are some areas to which i think too little priority has been given .
i am extremely pleased about that , and i very much agree that this is an area to which high priority should be given .
i think we have to be aware of the situation in the united states .
i could go on and on .
the situation of the developing countries is quite different in this respect .
i would also thank you for the many practical points of view which have been presented in the debate .
allow me to comment on a few of them .
the debate is closed .
there is still a lot of work to be done , but it should be possible to welcome new member states after the end of 2002 .
there is still a lot of work to be done , but it should now be possible to welcome new member states after the end of 2002 .
a european union that does not take unemployment seriously can never be the citizens ' europe we all wish to see .
thank you , mr president-in-office of the council , for your speech .
that is what we are doing today .
it is necessary for the future of europe .
my third and last point is enlargement .
you therefore have a special responsibility .
this is not acceptable .
( applause )
we have four years to get to work .
( applause )
it is now or never .
the most important one is , of course , enlargement .
the second priority concerns jobs .
i would also like to say a few words about crisis management .
but what has happened since ?
well , the development in europe has taken a wrong turn .
europe is being closed .
finally , enlargement .
there are five questions i would like to ask you .
what would your answer be to that ?
we support this as much as you do .
it must be successful .
you will have to deal with it .
it was the same for the euro .
we also need coordination of all the various aspects of european policy in order to promote employment .
the commission applies the current criteria .
competition should also work in favour of employment .
i did have more questions but i am out of time .
mr president , parliament is a place where we do not actually debate very much .
we are now beginning to discuss the proposal for a european food authority .
such an overall solution requires more than the proposed food authority .
i hope to have the support of the presidency for this idea .
i hope that this will be the case .
i would like it to happen , but i am not sure if it will .
when we talk about the major issues and enlargement , it seems that we are more or less in agreement .
it is parliament that has been responsible for enlargement .
i take note of what you have said about the environmental issue and i share your views to a great extent .
i am quite sure that discussions of this kind will take place in the group of euro countries .
you are all very welcome .
what happened ?
i want to address a second point .
how are the markets to understand it ?
you , foreign minister , can make a major contribution here .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
that is certainly not enough for the consumer .
with these measures , we have taken transparency in the work of the council a step further .
it is quite simply a fundamental demand for democracy .
i must apply the rules of procedure .
since they deal with the same subject , questions nos 11 and 12 will be taken together .
that is my first question .
they will , therefore , not be able to take part in that meeting .
the council does not give in to pressure .
i fully agree with the honourable member 's view .
when we discuss such important issues , it is important that all parties concerned are able to take part in the discussion in an appropriate way .
however , there are areas in which parliament needs to act .
in this area , the social partners have been trying to reach an agreement for ten years .
of course we have agreed that they must reach an agreement by may next year .
but they have not reached agreement .
there are , however , different views on how to achieve greater safety .
perhaps less would be more in this case .
in this respect i believe that he has been very successful .
i would like to add that any proposal presented by the commission in the future will have to guarantee the high level of safety that we all wish to see .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
priorities in road safety
, rapporteur .
we also need european legislation in certain important areas .
but how can that be ?
a year on there is no directive .
more talk . no action .
we have had talk on this issue , year in , year out .
i would like to address three particular points .
i have a problem with this .
finally , i would like to thank the commissioner for being so very open to our proposals .
that is the crucial question , not what the law says .
talk to your countries .
that is what road safety needs .
what does this mean ?
mr president , let me thank the rapporteur for the great commitment she has shown in this matter .
something has to be done about this .
i see this as a most important aspect .
it is vital to call for cooperation between the commission and the member states .
we have not said no to a directive before .
finally , there is the matter of education and the situation of children .
ladies and gentlemen , you are absolutely right .
this is not being done for two fundamental reasons .
i do not know .
why do we have to force them to do so ?
i do not believe that that is the main problem .
the problem of control is much more important .
mr president , on a point of order .
the debate is closed .
that is why this kind of transport is often not taken seriously enough yet .
mr president , commissioner , i would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
mr president , commissioner , first of all i would like to thank both the commission and our rapporteur for their work on this issue .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
how can we do this ?
that is the first issue .
firstly , we must finally achieve a single market in this area .
we never received that report .
is it the end of the world ?
i have a problem with this .
that is something we are all agreed on in this house .
furthermore , he has had many amendments to work through .
i am sure it is the same in other eu member states .
following research , this seems not to be the case .
why should a system of this kind only be applied to the transport sector ?
a great deal , however , remains to be done .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( parliament adopted the minutes )
this was a cause for great concern .
they are doing it themselves and have been doing so for a long time .
we know that there are various systems in the member states .
that is not a job for governments - it is a job for the parties .
the european union has made considerable progress in this regard .
we clearly have a problem , therefore .
but that is , of course , something we can discuss .
we have to keep on saying these things because they are needed .
this is unacceptable in a democracy .
mr president , i want to express my thanks for a good report .
so what can be done ?
this is unacceptable and needs to be the focus of more attention .
i would just like to tell you about the french situation , where we have a law which is currently being implemented for local elections .
that is less than 10 % , and that means that the french situation is significant .
this is the only comment i wanted to make .
we have to work on this .
we might well question how this should be done .
how can we help women ?
people now act as if it were a system which only applies to women , but it is a system that is used in many areas of society .
we must change this situation .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
nevertheless , the commission has to ensure that fair competition takes place .
that is the key issue here , rather than trying to favour our industry .
that is what we all want to do .
that is my last point .
is this also the opinion of the commission ?
the time necessary for the process is longer , however .
they are in line with the commission 's views .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
madam president , i wish to put a request to you and the house .
what is the point of the european parliament ?
this is the issue being raised again .
we do not need to start a debate on the issue .
that is not acceptable .
vote
i shall therefore vote in favour of this report .
that is why i voted for this report .
for these reasons , we will not be able to vote for the report .
this applies also to the field of transport .
it is particularly important in this context to :
however , the basic problem here is something quite different .
we cannot vote on this point now .
you cannot do so now .
in addition to this , however , account must be taken of the requirements of stability and the country 's future .
the joint debate is closed .
that is why i would like to call on the commissioner to pay even greater attention to this region .
mr president , i wish to begin by saying a few words about humanitarian assistance to this region .
but we are still there .
i say this as a european .
the joint debate is closed .
human rights
it is up to the government to act .
that is our main demand .
but unfortunately we cannot .
why ?
mr president , much has already been said by other members .
but why , in fact , is this not being done ?
the most fundamental task of the state is to protect its people .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
international criminal court
we all know how difficult is was to bring it about .
it is important for europe to take the lead .
those objectives have been achieved .
words are not enough .
the time for action is now .
the commission will provide further support for these activities this year .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
members of the commission , let us see if , this time , we can make it on time .
it left yesterday .
my view here is that we need additional resources for this .
so i thank you for the very strong support here .
we will come back on how to do these things .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i have not received this document , but i take it that what you say is true .
now i do not know why i have been given the floor first .
that is why it would be only fair for you to give him the floor first .
therefore , i can take 20 minutes .
i say this as a point of principle to the member states and the council itself .
( applause )
this is a guarantee .
we should welcome it and therefore welcome his report .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
and that is what i have done , mr president .
that is why i shall vote in its favour .
ladies and gentlemen , i have a statement to make .
furthermore , i have asked the committee on legal affairs and the internal market for an opinion on what action the european parliament should take in respect of this matter .
"
i have certainly taken note of your comment .
the day before yesterday , i had the opportunity to speak to turkey 's minister of justice , and i made him aware of the urgent nature of the situation .
economic and social cohesion
the next item is the commission communication on economic and social cohesion .
the second issue is enlargement .
there has been progress .
how can we address these issues ?
why ?
the debate is only just beginning .
how are we to carry out this cohesion policy ?
let us first discuss objectives , content and european priorities .
i should like to hear your views on this .
it would not , therefore , be fair .
i see this as a reference point .
that is all i can say for the present .
" that is not to say that the means have to be financial , but we must also look at other policies .
i am not in a position , nor do i have any wish , to decide the matter right now .
would you agree that we also need to allow sufficient time for this , because we know from experience that it takes time to develop regions ?
where do you stand on this ?
commissioner , i agree that there can be no union without economic and social cohesion , and that there can be no cohesion without means .
i also agree that the structural funds used have been effective and positive .
i would like you to be more specific , commissioner .
we are going to have to find a solution to this .
i want us to discuss solidarity and to reach agreement on our political objectives .
that is my first point .
my second point is solidarity .
we must continue to promote solidarity between states .
i ask this because if we have the budget that has been approved , then we will have money .
you have not said anything about these regions and they are of concern to me .
mr president , i want to thank the commissioner for using the word solidarity in connection with this report .
this is , of course , precisely what cohesion policy and regional policy are about .
that is why i think we do indeed need a cohesion policy and support for cohesion in future .
there is a specific paragraph on these regions .
thank you , commissioner .
the next item is the joint debate on :
i know that the european union and the commission are working hard to achieve this .
i think the commission should take this situation into account .
at the same time we wish to draw attention to education .
what we need , however , is many small projects .
the need for regional integration is another important issue which should be discussed .
this is what we expect .
i would like to focus on human rights and the rule of law .
they are two real priorities but they are different .
we know what will happen , but we do not know how to prevent it , although we want to prevent it at all costs .
let us not , therefore , set political priorities against one another .
' but what we really need is a budget and it must be used .
the same applies to human rights .
the same applies to the european union 's respect for the rights of all citizens .
unfortunately , this is true .
i have a question for the council .
i do not know what the problem is , but there is a problem .
there is a great deal of work to be done , it can be done and , indeed , it must be done .
i welcome this debate .
it has been an extremely good debate .
i should like now to give you my assessment of where we stand and where we should go from here .
this was clearly not the right moment .
help from the european parliament in this respect would be most welcome .
i fully agree with these .
the question is how best to go about it .
i hope parliament will understand .
that is what we are trying to do .
it is a real policy that we want to make work in real time .
i believe that today 's debate is crucial given the time at which it is taking place .
i believe that we should focus the debate on at least three questions .
and the third , and perhaps most important , is what direction must we give to the peace process in 2001 ?
i believe that there is still the possibility that this summit will take place , and also the possibility that it may take place in europe .
progress has been made in all areas .
i am sure the commission will also do so .
that is what i can tell you at the moment .
i believe i am right in saying , as i mentioned a moment or two ago , that some honourable members who have recently been in the area have strong views on this subject .
let us hope that you are right !
now that would be what i would call a new peace process .
( applause )
we are all agreed on one thing : it is important to give money , but we are not giving enough .
we must call them both to task about this .
"
why is this ?
that is my first question .
we agree .
i ask the european union to do what it does best .
perhaps they would come to understand better .
people of europe have no idea of this .
this is completely unacceptable .
i address my comments to the council and to the commission .
why do i say this ?
that is the commitment that those of us who are involved in trying to find a solution at the moment wish to achieve .
why do i say this ?
and that was my hope .
i want to make this point absolutely clear .
i hope that has made clear the commission 's position on this issue .
the debate is closed .
i hope that this is also the view of the commission and the council .
these areas of cooperation are also priority areas for the government .
we agree , commissioner , that violence can only create more violence .
what type of programmes are they ?
how is it going to do this ?
responsibility for what ?
i support the view of the committee on development and cooperation .
the opportunity before us is there for all to see .
how many resolutions have we adopted ?
we have our own plan .
i would like clear information on this matter .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we were able to get the council 's agreement on three points .
but not so .
two things are most important .
this investment is necessary .
i think , then , that we have a good result and i want to thank everyone involved .
the decisions we are to adopt today aim to improve the quality of the service .
the problem is that it does not work .
let us be clear about this .
many of you , ladies and gentlemen , have raised this issue .
this can be achieved through specific measures of this nature .
i would like to focus once more on two particular points .
it is all a matter of having the right rules .
i do not therefore have a problem with her technical proposals nor indeed the commission 's proposals .
the debate is closed .
however , i feel we need to go further still .
we are all agreed on this matter .
furthermore , there must be more focus on consumer information than is the case at present .
on the other hand , we do in principle accept amendments nos 5 , 11 , and 15 .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
" there is therefore a lot of interest in these matters .
i believe we have reached a good compromise .
there is something wrong there .
we must put it right quickly .
things will go a lot better then , you will see .
the debate is closed .
but european cooperation is more urgent than ever .
there is a great need for the council to act .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
the issue is being decided at present by the court of human rights and will not go away .
( the minutes were approved )
decision on urgent procedure
they are also based on the opinion of the scientific committee .
the proposed measure should therefore be very welcome to both industry and consumers .
we would therefore welcome your comments on this .
then we also take account of the financial aspects .
( applause )
what is the matter with them ?
and there is an end to it .
it is a fact of life .
that is out of the question .
i have heard it all before in recent years .
so what are we going to do now ?
we were aware of the consequences of this .
so what should our approach be in the face of all this ?
are we doing all we can to support research , especially public research ?
this is what they rightly expect of us .
let me give an example .
what is being done now is a step in the right direction .
i refer to coordination and control .
other members have raised the same point .
i know from my own country that this is a problem .
what are we going to do ?
every question i now want to ask the commission comes from that experience .
what do the member states themselves say ?
these are all serious questions , which we know you will try to answer .
so i welcome the ban .
but is it really necessary ?
there is no doubt about that .
we need to take action now across europe .
( applause from the right )
how do the commission and the council deal with this ?
the final point is to look for a solution .
that is not the issue .
it is about food safety .
what is being done ?
that is just not on .
the commissioner has the floor .
why is that the case ?
this will put us in a much better position to decide if further needs to be done .
the question is how and where .
then appropriate decisions can be made in the light of that situation .
we cannot do that .
that is a matter for each individual member states .
the debate on the statement by the commission is closed .
there are six of these .
it is extremely urgent to take this matter further .
i support the changes that have been made .
many of you here know my view on this issue .
it is a scientific issue .
that is the very reason why this issue was considered in the wto .
i have been through this before .
i have had this debate with parliament and i know what is going to happen later in the day .
i will begin with the amendments the commission cannot accept .
this is not acceptable .
i would like stress that monitoring systems already exist both in the member states and at community level .
the debate is closed .
this is why this report is excellent .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for all the work and the research she has carried out .
these are the good points .
are you aware of that , ladies and gentlemen ?
the debate is closed .
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
madam president , we would accept this proposal .
madam president , there is also a possible compromise on the following vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
for this reason we have voted against these two reports .
first of all , the projects lack a legal basis .
nevertheless , the conclusion was soon reached that this instrument was not up to the task .
for these reasons i did not vote for this report .
that was in fact the main reason for this own initiative report .
so why question it ?
"
agenda
madam president , i refer to the draft regulation on european political parties .
could you ask the commission if it would make a statement on this matter at some stage before the house ?
president .
secondly , there is a political reason .
i simply wanted to make this point clear , because so many questions have been discussed in this area .
we will give you the information .
and there is another thing .
thank you very much .
but i am taking the floor about another matter .
i should very much like an answer to these questions either this week or next week .
perhaps you could do something for me .
the debate is closed .
precisely because the problem , like the sector , is of a global nature , an international solution is of great importance .
it is important to take an overall view of this problem .
we support the proposal of the commission .
so we must do something about it .
i think that is a good thing .
i think that is also a good thing .
i think that the commission has done its work well too .
the debate is closed .
our group will support you .
i also support the commission 's proposal regarding its proposed procedure in this connection .
however , all these issues are very important in the context of enlargement .
there is still much to be done but now the work is off to a good start .
i already brought this matter up last time .
i should just like to bring up a few other small points , small in a certain sense .
not any longer .
the directive , therefore , needs to be implemented as soon as possible .
that is positive .
mr president , i would firstly like to say that the commission is pleased to see that the european parliament has given priority to this report , to this initiative .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i would like to point out that the rapporteur is not present .
it is very short .
he was working under great time pressure .
but we keep coming back to the same question : why did things have to get to this stage ?
the proposal before us is a step in the right direction .
but at the same time i wish to stress that this is only one step in the right direction .
there is still a great deal to do .
it is an example to other areas as well .
the reform of the common fisheries policy , i believe , is an opportunity .
we must make sure that we get the reforms right .
it is a very serious problem .
for that reason , at this point i only wish to comment on the report actually before us now .
i shall now turn to the amendment that has been tabled .
why ?
the debate is closed .
thank you , mr president .
vote on a request for urgent procedure
( parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
that is what we are trying to do right now .
i do not need to say any more about this .
so what public debate are we talking about ?
another question : how much social and economic solidarity are we prepared to show one another ?
and again : are we prepared to show the same solidarity when it comes to internal and external security ?
it is absolutely unacceptable .
( applause from the right )
which is why we want structural changes in the council of ministers .
( applause from the right )
we should like to be more specific .
my second comment concerns asylum and immigration policy .
but we also call on the commission to take account of the consequences in its initiatives .
asylum and immigration policy as a whole must be a priority .
i think we need to step up our efforts here .
mr president of the commission , let us work on that together .
( applause )
you do not need to make many proposals ; instead , you should try to bring those that you do propose to a successful conclusion .
these are the key aspects of the programme .
this is what we need .
we are all in this together .
we have to move away from this .
we have to change the way we do our business .
i would like to see them .
( applause )
population growth was mentioned here .
in this we all have a great public responsibility .
no , civil society is very much a reality .
what indeed remains of the eu 's development policy ?
the second major priority i wish to ask you about is the new economic and social agenda .
why not ?
it is not a done deal .
more state and less market or more market and less state ?
we want to see the majority of all decisions taken in the member states and in local areas .
that is a matter we are well able to decide for ourselves .
( applause )
i take a different view .
it is out of the question and that is not our position .
if there are , then the matter should be referred to the european court of justice .
( applause )
but how ?
europe requires a different strategy , a different idea .
mr president , enlargement is the most important european project of our time .
now comes the difficult part , however .
that is not , of course , what we are doing at present .
now is the time to do something about it .
that is their job .
they have no authority over community institutions , such as the commission or even parliament .
the technical work would thus be out of the way before we move on to the political work .
mr president , i start with the commission 's work programme for 2001 .
"
the people must have their say , including those in the candidate countries .
there are important questions .
our group would also like to do the same in this debate .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the president of the commission on his speech today and on his report on the year 2000 .
mr president , i am sure that this initiative , which is one of the commission 's priorities , will soon be a reality .
the commission has the right of initiative and must present proposals .
the european research area is of course important .
president .
but you would not want to use it to apply for another job , because you would not get it .
is it transparency ?
is that more democracy , i ask you ?
thank you .
for the moment , this must be carried out within a full agenda .
it is therefore a year of change , and i believe that parliament will want to play a full part in this major political change in europe .
i am speaking now only of the model .
but we must go further than that previous model .
there are - and we must work on this - some points that are essential .
regarding sustainable development , i agree with what has been said .
the debate is closed .
that is what we aim to achieve with these questions .
we have done that .
ladies and gentlemen , what is it that europe needs ?
we must make sure they are effective .
vote
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the decision )
president .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we have voted against this report .
we just need to make sure that it is used .
europe can and must provide us with this as well .
i shall vote in favour of all the proposals to that end .
" " of course , " i said .
there will also be reports dealing with your safety as well . "
another example can be found in competition policy .
the second is the legislative and institutional framework .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
for all these reasons , it should i hope , be possible , at last , to adopt the text of this directive tomorrow .
we have tabled two amendments which we consider to be very important .
this too is a possibility which we should debate .
that is the question we should ask ourselves .
that is what will happen to the markets .
but it is not .
and then parliament is asked not to make any more amendments .
i have never seen members put under such pressure by their governments and parties .
but with the council and the governments on either side , in the council and in parliament , what need is there for parliament ?
parliament has its own responsibility and it must live up to it .
everything that can be said about the directive has already been said .
it is therefore a little difficult to begin to speak now .
where is the right balance to be found ?
but there is more to this debate than principles .
i would therefore ask you to support amendment no 4 .
this means something .
mr president , we need to be clear about what we are trying to achieve in this directive .
a great deal has been said about the need for balance .
that is a directive for a citizens ' europe .
the committee on legal affairs and the internal market has also tabled proposals here and i call on parliament to support them tomorrow .
i refer to what has already been said .
mr president , thank you for giving me the floor on this important subject .
most of those amendments were , in fact , compromise amendments , also on crucial issues .
the commission is in a position to accept all of the compromise amendments .
we have , however , concerns about some of the other amendments which have been voted .
the question is should or should not the commission support amendment no 5 and if so , why ?
i welcome this .
the eu commission is to make proposals here , it is true , but we do not know what they are .
that is not something to which we can be a party .
in this connection , i want to congratulate him on the report .
only a small part of the agenda 2000 reform has really been implemented .
i therefore ask you to return your opinion on today 's proposal as quickly as possible .
thank you for your attention .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his statement .
these measures are a step in the right direction .
as i , in fact , said .
i think you are quite right .
since these are national measures , national assistance rules apply .
and we are doing that , we have accepted that .
that is also a fact of life .
what is the commission 's view on this ?
mr president , i should like to ask the commissioner three questions .
it makes the position clear .
why ?
question time ( commission )
mr president , this point of order is to ask you for express support in relation to what i am going to say .
part i
i thank the commissioner for his reply .
what can i say ?
and there you have it .
the eu will keep up the pressure to ensure that they are .
the people now want to see real progress .
thank you very much , commissioner .
i would thank the commissioner for his answer .
i have a number of questions .
i am sure that will continue .
thank you for your answer .
that will take place in due course .
thank you , commissioner .
the position in the council , if anything , is not even as good as that .
member states are responsible for the implementation of these measures .
thank you for your answer , commissioner .
the implementation by member states of safety measures put in place at community level is of crucial importance .
and what is the reason for them ?
it is important to understand what we are talking about .
there are member states that take the view that i did not go far enough .
i believe that all member states now fully understand the importance of this .
do you agree with this ?
it is a matter for the member state to decide .
some member states do that .
that other measure can be allowed in those circumstances .
what is the conclusion ? the conclusion is that rules and monitoring are necessary .
i think that all this together will make an important contribution to the protection of the environment and the protection of public health .
i do not think that the word " better " is enough .
the answer is , quite clearly , no , it will not .
however , i would like to point out the concerns that the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and parliament had at first and second reading .
parliament 's third task is to take responsibility .
this will benefit consumers all over the world , as well as industry .
that is a decision that has to be taken between the member states and the commission .
we know very well that this is just the first step in the process .
there is other legislation under way .
the debate is closed .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i should like to speak in favour of the proposal , for it must stand to reason that parliament has to keep to the basis of the treaty .
i believe that there can be no question of our not voting on this directive .
we have heard one speech for the motion and one against .
mr president , we are discussing a very important directive today .
that is why the commission 's proposal is so important .
that is the basis for consumer confidence .
we welcome this contribution .
we would be better off without it .
in conclusion , mr president , in my opinion , parliament can adopt once and for all the document adopted by the commission .
it is most important .
ladies and gentlemen , the internal market does not work .
i know that she has had a very difficult task .
i accept this principle .
this is also our aim .
therefore , i cannot accept amendment no 11 .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i do not agree with that .
it is not a case of saying one thing and doing another from that side of the house .
finally , i have a question for the commission .
there has been great progress in research in this field , and it is now up to us to implement this research .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
so i will not go through the amendments .
he has done a good job on that .
if it were , we would support it .
at the end there is a list of things that the commission and council want to bring back to us .
when is all this going to end ?
they are wrong .
we must and we will .
we are fully in agreement with that .
why should parliament change its mind now ?
i cannot therefore vote in favour of the council 's common position .
this draft has been before us for three years already .
we have come a long way since then .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the process is open .
by means of its communication concerning the role of local and regional authorities , the commission has already made a start upon work of this kind .
by including in this proposal the role of local and regional authorities in employment policy , we ensure that there is a legal basis for this initiative .
first of all , i want to congratulate the rapporteur .
as we all know , the report was , of course , adopted by a very large majority of the committee .
first of all , information must be provided about employment policy .
secondly , the parties in the labour market , together with the relevant local and regional authorities , must be involved .
mr president , i really do not think we need this .
one of the union 's objectives is to promote a high level of employment .
this is a very good report .
some of the amendments that have come through have not made it a better document .
i refer to just two aspects .
but only the women have their own committee to speak up for them .
the second point concerns the budget .
this is why women have their own committee .
so i can only accept amendment no 10 in part .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
it is our responsibility to use them .
we will look into this matter .
( the minutes were approved )
turkey will then have to act .
it is a difficult issue .
the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy has taken account of all the amendments proposed by the committee on budgets .
so on this one point , i would very much like a clear answer from the commission as to the impact that amendment no 1 will have .
it is a large country and it is very different from the other candidate countries .
the crucial question then , and now , is what can , and must , the eu do to improve the situation ?
the question now is does this strategy work ?
but i do not want to go into that here .
we do not think so .
is this the case ?
turkey 's economic importance for the european union today is considerable .
secondly , article 4 of the commission proposal .
but the question is under what conditions and with what financial resources .
" i think this is our problem .
we do not need to go any further .
i would like to discuss a practical case in turkey .
this position is wrong for three reasons .
the first reason is that the budget for these programmes has already been decided .
this would have two consequences .
and of course this does not apply to turkey .
but one thing must be clear : turkey 's accession to the european union can only take place under the conditions set by europe , not simply on turkey 's terms .
accession will only take place on our terms .
the question we must now answer is : can we achieve the same with turkey ?
it simply has not .
that is why one cannot say either that it has not had any results .
turkey is an important country .
that can and must not happen .
as far as the financial and budgetary aspect is concerned , questions have been raised , which i will be pleased to answer .
the commission would like this to happen too .
that is , in fact , the political basis for the situation we have today .
when we see these changes , the time will have come to talk about the next step , but not today .
let me just say that we in the council naturally see these issues as being extremely important .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
they are also a reference for the progress we can make in the next few years .
this is in the interests of us all .
we also need to make more effort in the area of high technology .
an example is water .
it is important that there be a balance between these three areas , which are all vital to the process .
so let us focus on certain important issues so as to set the process in motion .
secondly , there is the role of education and training .
we must take this problem into consideration .
we need more global rules for global competition .
this is in the interest of the european model of a social market economy .
i hope they are as good as their word .
no , clearly not .
i did not hear that mentioned recently .
are we to be the victims of our own success ?
but the question is this : who is responsible for this economic policy ?
in which areas will we need more information before long ?
we need more data on the growth of services in the european union .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
vote
all these further amendments are unacceptable to the commission .
i only hope that there will be some members left to vote .
madam president , i am actually in the same situation .
before the vote on amendment no 11
i call on my colleagues to vote against it .
( applause from the right )
for this reason , i ask that we vote on this report today and that we do not refer it back to committee .
the court of justice will agree with us at all times .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that is what today 's vote means .
why ?
i do not believe that is the currently the position of council .
we believe it is important to establish clear rules in this area .
we therefore voted against this report .
now is the time for european environmental legislation to get really serious .
i am not making this up , it is true !
i hope so .
this is really important .
this is why i believe it was important to keep to the approach decided by parliament in 1998 .
obviously , they should not present a health risk .
. i fully support proposals to encourage an employment strategy across the european union .
jobs , jobs , jobs .
that is what it is all about .
we therefore voted against this report .
the objective is to promote cooperation between member states and support their action in the area of employment .
that is why the union for a europe of nations group has supported this report .
madam president , we remain concerned about turkey .
it is not possible to bring about change in turkey by giving money to the government .
these three points i refer to the decision of the house .
that is also one of the european union 's priorities .
i will talk about employment first .
these are very important matters that we must concern ourselves with in the months to come .
i have a final comment to make .
all the activities of the european central bank in this area are of special importance .
why ?
this is a matter that has been discussed by your committee .
we are completely open to any proposals in this connection .
the president of the bank has already made some reference to the efforts made .
the debate is closed .
i would like to make two points .
how do we measure this success ?
that would help our debate a great deal .
let the committee on economic and monetary affairs , or the committee on employment and social affairs , or the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy in .
this is excellent , as it is vital for both growth and solidarity .
of course there are .
we have now done just that , but on our own initiative .
my second point concerns social protection .
this has now been done .
the most important is coordination of research and development policies .
they are based on the idea that such growth must be supported by structural reform .
no economic policy without this objective is possible .
yesterday she was at the joint meeting of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the committee on employment and social affairs .
few have taken up this aspect .
i congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work .
i shall try to make a few comments .
we can mention public investment , as some of you have done .
but for us the important thing is the global strategy .
there is one point i think is of interest , which was raised throughout the debate , especially in the first part this morning .
i believe that right now we already have enough instruments , at least for relations between the commission and parliament , to be able to make progress in our joint work .
in any case , the institutional agreement should also include the council .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
that is what is at issue .
the council is currently giving the proposal its first reading .
there are three aspects to today 's debate .
such workers are of course an issue for accession countries .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to make two points .
that is why we expect you to include these groups of people .
we know . we all do .
i could not agree more , and everyone should support this view .
do not ask me why .
something must be done about this .
but there is a time and place for everything .
it is not just about lack of social security protection .
that is why our group is of the opinion that we should use this right at long last to force a dialogue with the council .
i believe that that is not right .
that is why we are in conflict , and not so much in terms of the objectives .
we believe this is extremely important .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
as they deal with the same subject , questions nos 1 and 2 will be taken together .
we must have a clear answer to this .
that is my question .
it is not about the general principles .
no now .
this is also sometimes the case with regard to military cooperation .
i also know that these issues are being discussed in all member states .
however , i shall do this on my own behalf , not on behalf of the council .
the aim is for us to come to an agreement by 1 may 2001 in line with the provisions set out in the treaty of amsterdam .
i believe this question is so serious that it requires some special action .
i was the rapporteur for that plan .
however , it is not for the president of the council to comment on efforts by individual member states .
as the honourable member will , i am sure , understand , it is not possible for me to comment on a specific individual case .
therefore i ask you to make a point of order .
i am not going to allow any more points of order .
there will not be a debate on this .
i wanted to focus in particular on the general affairs council .
that is the reason why unfortunately there is not that much to report as yet .
mr president-in-office , thank you for your reply .
the action plan for sustainable development is after all to be presented by the commission .
i too should like to thank the president-in-office for his answer .
we have a report about to go before this house in brussels .
however , initiatives can be taken in the matter of work in progress .
in this context , i would like us to review the agricultural policy as such .
i can only agree with what the honourable member says .
i believe we are entirely in agreement in this area .
it is therefore not possible for the council to comment on the question that has been put .
i fully share their opinion .
the debate is closed .
this is important and i believe that it has already been done .
the very positive aspects that i have just mentioned must not , however , lead the european union 's authorities to pay less close attention to later developments .
i hope that some of you will also have the opportunity to meet him .
the debate is closed .
there are a number of key issues which i have raised which must be on that agenda .
it must include effective monitoring of human rights .
we shall obviously be voting in favour .
we would much rather make our own agreements on our own terms .
i have two specific points to make .
of crucial importance will also be how democracy and human rights are implemented .
the debate is closed .
we do not yet have that policy in place .
we support the french initiative .
joint efforts are required here at eu level .
i do not believe it is .
a common policy is required in this area .
who is really responsible ?
we know this , of course , from the market economy in general .
i would say not .
that is why we need these measures .
we must do more .
why ?
i really do not understand at all .
we have two fundamental concerns about the french proposal , which make it difficult for us to accept the proposed text .
this , as i see it , is especially true in this case .
the debate is closed .
the creation of a european research area is vital to this .
but at the moment , ladies and gentlemen , there is absolutely no question of having one european research policy .
more coordination at a programme level is also necessary .
i would like to hear the commissioner 's point of view on this matter .
that was successful too .
this must be a key part of the european research area .
that is another point we in the committee on culture consider extremely important .
i hope the commission will also take this into account .
we wish you success , commissioner , because your success in this field will be parliament 's success and the european union 's success too .
to call it so is one thing , to make it so is , of course , another , more difficult thing .
for that reason , we must demand that any common research area must be developed according to scientific criteria .
i welcome that .
i also find the term ' research area ' very effective .
i believe this is a good initiative from the commission .
the situation being as it is , i will make two proposals .
europe would have much to do in such a project .
it has become a political fact .
we must consider how we propose to achieve this .
but i also understand your concern about the need to ensure that these instruments offer equal opportunities for all .
that is obviously one of the questions on which the discussions will focus .
we therefore believe that it is up to the member states to take the initiative .
i think we cannot avoid a debate on this question .
clearly there is also the question of international cooperation .
thank you very much for your address , commissioner . we certainly did not find it too long .
we as a committee would very much like an answer .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
it is right to do so . however , that alone is not enough to ensure a future for the sector .
the debate is closed .
vote
i hope i have made myself clear !
mr president , a moment ago you quite rightly asked where the council was .
mr president , i should just like parliament to be clear about what it is voting on here .
the vote is completely clear .
i give the floor to the rapporteur .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
mr president , i do not wish to speak on the subject of the debate .
this house has decided .
we accept that .
that is democracy .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we do not agree with that .
if this is not the case , we shall vote against .
i think that this discussion should never have taken place in the european parliament .
so i voted against the whole resolution .
we therefore voted against this report .
mr president , i voted for the motion because i was against it , as did the majority of the other members of the european parliament .
"
"
" .
" " what 's the matter ?
"
we therefore need to :
more regulation is the problem , not the solution .
however there are aspects which are not supported .
but for this to happen we need less words and more action .
we voted against this report .
therefore , with this in mind , i voted for the report .
we voted against this report .
for all the above reasons , i voted against .
situation in kosovo
what is the task of the eu ?
but let me come back to today 's debate .
it is a matter of how things stand now in kosovo .
i believe the government 's new plan is good .
why should we not play a part ?
if you would like to make this proposal to the president of your group so that he can bring it to the attention of the other members , then we may be able to do something .
i believe we must see that as an absolutely fundamental principle .
very many colleagues have been there and know what the situation is like .
we have still made no progress at all with this .
as regards kosovo , we were already aware of many of the issues raised .
the joint debate is closed .
the time has now come for him to act .
the joint debate is closed .
human rights
the resolution is a good text .
i hope that our european commission will show the same powers of initiative .
that is completely unacceptable .
it is appropriate that human rights there should be discussed at the same time as increased cooperation .
those who took part in it have not been seen since .
but , all this is not enough .
we must do all that we can to bring this to an end .
in my view , that is the least it could do .
we can help to achieve this .
the debate we have held today in this house will , without a doubt , be fundamental to the decision we take .
some of you have asked what we are going to do about these matters .
that , then , is what the commission is doing to improve the human rights situation .
i believe that the european union and the commission have an important role to play .
it may well be that we cannot do anything about it .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
i should also like to express my solidarity with the victims .
thank you , commissioner .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i would like to deal with why we have tabled this issue regarding decisions in ireland .
it is the first time that a decision regarding one of these member states has been taken in this way and this decision concerns the stability of the european currency .
let there be no doubt that this shall remain a priority for us in the future .
in this respect clearly something must be done .
the question is , however , who shall take the action ?
the european union , is therefore responsible for competition and currency stability .
the same applies to social security systems and education .
that is something we can discuss .
i have no doubt my colleagues coming after me will do so .
on this point ireland has everything well under control .
we do not believe that this is the case .
i do not think that would be possible .
i would , therefore , like to congratulate the commission once again for having adopted this resolution .
not at all .
we must not let this happen .
that was important .
" i accept that , as a commission , you have the right to do what you did .
now , things are beginning to go well for europe again .
why , then , can ireland not be allowed to go its own way ?
just look , they say .
those are policy matters to be decided upon at national level .
on that basis , we can talk about what we are , or are not , to do .
if it were not , this proposal would not have been made .
is our approach wrong ?
the commission presented the matter to the group of euro countries and to the economic and financial affairs council .
in my opinion , the commission did what it had to do .
the debate is closed .
mr president , as you will see there are very few people here .
vote
the next item is the vote on the urgent resolutions .
that was the last statement of this sitting as we have reached the end of the agenda .
statement by the president
agenda
these two reports will be taken off the agenda .
the agenda is thus adopted .
thank you very much , madam president .
however , the request to which you have referred raised a very serious problem .
i have not , to date , received any response .
i now understand better why i have not received a response .
commission reform : human resources
the next item is the commission communication on commission reform : human resources .
these proposals are all available to the house .
therefore it is very important that he be here .
i should like to address two problems .
i should like , therefore , to ask three questions .
they are not .
that is an excellent answer with which to close this debate .
i think it was the very least i could do .
there is no point in making a point of order : you will be able to speak on the subject tomorrow .
that is also a possible solution !
i had two points .
this is not a point of order !
i congratulate you .
amendment no 1 is included in the opinion of the committee on agriculture .
we are now concerned with the budget amendment before us .
we must put an end to this situation .
we are not only dealing with a financial crisis .
in reality , however , what we must do is to bring about a change of course .
" let me make this very clear .
there is no more after this .
in the view of my group it is not .
what has the commission done on this point ?
we need a change of policy course .
but then what will we do ?
the real question is what it is used for and why it is necessary .
but that is not the problem : the key issue is whether there will be enough money left over to set a new course in our agricultural policy .
this issue needs , as it has needed in the past , to come off the agenda .
i should just like to make , as would the members of my group , a few comments .
that is not all , however .
" that is not the problem that we face .
commissioner , mr president , that is all i wanted to say .
you have our full support .
i do not feel that this would be the right thing to do , and i will tell you why .
overall , i think the commission 's proposal is a good one .
above all , it is necessary .
that means that more will need to be done .
the budget of the european union is a little over 1 % .
it is important to make this clear .
of course , we can , and must , discuss whether further measures are necessary .
but we have to agree something at this stage .
now to the question of the further measures which can be adopted as a result of the crisis . i think it is a good thing that so many proposals have been tabled .
we must be prepared for this possibility .
the debate is closed .
clearly we have to be very concerned with the present situation .
i would now like to hear your views on the current situation .
the next item is question time .
i very much welcome what the commissioner had to say about the actions that had been taken by the british government .
mr president , commissioner , i have two questions .
are you well prepared ?
thank you , commissioner , for coming today .
there is also eu legislation .
the answer to that question is no .
could he be a little more specific on that ?
nothing has been brought to my attention in relation to that .
that is my first question .
mr president , i have three questions .
can you say anything about this ?
is that true ?
that is an issue that member states are responsible for themselves .
would he not agree with me that this is the case ?
the next item is the joint debate on the following three reports :
it would be an important addition to citizens ' rights .
at the same time , i propose an increase in transparency .
the market can do a great deal , but it cannot do everything .
it would be very good if a plan of action could be agreed there .
that is the priority .
so where does this take us ?
and that means fair access .
this communication must be free .
no , we cannot .
i would like to think so , although it is not certain it would have .
i want to try and avoid that .
we have not done that with the amendments that we have made .
what are we actually about here ?
i am not sure if you have the balance right .
of that there can be no question ; we have been discussing this point for years .
we have enough time to consider this between now and the second reading ; perhaps we shall have found a common approach by then .
it is a small change .
these are not just any reports .
there will be a strong business case for it and public authorities must ensure that the right conditions are in place , and here we need to work together .
more than ever we need to work together .
the debate is closed .
in the majority of cases they come without sufficient information .
what is the purpose of this initiative ?
in addition , it is not the case that the european parliament has not concerned itself with these problems before .
i shall mention a few .
a second point .
a third point .
does such a thing exist ?
and i could go on .
we therefore welcome these two points .
that is what i wanted to say on the report under consideration .
the european structural funds play a major role in this process .
it is also about democracy and solidarity .
the debate is closed .
development policy
trade is the key .
we in parliament must support its efforts .
the priority within the six is also important .
however , we do not support just any development policy .
that is what parliament approved and what we want to see .
that is , it must not be a matter of europe following the member states or of member states following europe .
where does the european union stop having a direct interest and where does its development policy begin ?
i therefore hope that the house will adopt those amendments also adopted by the committee on development and cooperation .
we shall , in any case , have the opportunity to return to these issues in connection with the budget .
so are we , although we are aware that things are not going too well with development cooperation in the world , including european cooperation .
however , i should like to ask a few questions .
will we have any say in the expenditure of the european development fund ?
then there is health policy .
i thank him for that .
how can this be ?
what are the reasons for this ?
in my opinion , there is one basic reason .
this is also part of my approach in dealing with these issues .
we can only offer to do those things in the developing countries that we know how to do .
the member states have now decided .
we can always discuss whether we have done our part and whether it is good enough .
giving priority to health and education agreed and so on .
this is where we are now .
we never had that before .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this report must include the provisions which are adopted by the management committee of the fisheries sector in implementation of the provisions of that regulation .
we must change this system , commissioner .
we also support the request for greater information on the control and monitoring activities carried out within the regional fishing organisations .
i only have two points i want to make .
quite rightly , measures agreed on in these organisations are given a place in community law .
i think that this is a fundamental point .
let me start with a few comments on the two regulations , one on control measures and one on technical measures .
we have included both new and existing provisions in these regulations .
this proposal is part of the commission strategy set out in our communication on regional fisheries organisations .
the joint debate is closed .
of course , this is nothing new .
of course , it has happened time and time again and we must do something to try and control this .
i therefore ask that you support the three amendments which have been presented by the rapporteur and the committee on fisheries .
i should therefore like to know whether the commission would be prepared to take this fact into consideration .
as far as the proposed amendments are concerned , i can accept the first two in principle .
we need a reply .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the united nations security council must make a clear statement on this issue .
we do not know what has happened to them .
and why ?
that does not mean that my group questions the fact that there is a problem or that nothing should be done about it .
he is still there .
everyone can draw their own conclusions from this .
i believe it is extremely important that we should have a common view of the purpose behind the international community 's action against iraq .
these are difficult issues .
i would say once again , however , that i believe it is important that any action against iraq should be taken within the framework of the un 's resolutions .
they are important .
let us move in this direction .
i am sure that we all agree .
the problem is how to do it .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
however , we think that a number of changes need to be made .
why should it make such a request ?
it was a considerable success .
this has all been possible thanks to our serious commitment to these negotiations .
we had a full internal debate on this two or three years ago .
i agree with this opinion .
i come to greater political cooperation including security .
civil society should be part of the agreement .
so we can give a very positive response to that important proposal .
the debate is closed .
vote
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
thank you very much .
parliament voted in favour of several other amendments of less importance but i cannot accept them either .
this view is also expressed in the report .
i voted in favour of this motion for a resolution .
we voted against this paragraph .
it is not on their agenda .
finally this is a budgetary matter only .
that time is not now .
yet , that is not the most important point .
we do not .
why did i vote for it ?
so how could i not vote for this report ?
i therefore welcome the fact that this amendment has been adopted .
that was not the case with this report .
statement by the president
are there any comments ?
madam president , may i understand you to mean that you will call me again at the start of the discussion of the agenda ?
no , this can be done once the order of business has been established .
that is now the time when we deal with points of order .
( the minutes were approved )
agenda
the rules of procedure do not give me the authority to take this step .
there has , however , been no request for an amendment .
i cannot take this step , however .
there is one problem , however .
there was no vote for a resolution .
you can so decide under your authority as president .
the commission has not asked to do this as yet , but i am sure that it will agree to do so .
you did not see me - you do not look in this direction very often .
i have nothing to say with regard to the content .
we do not take a decision by majority that goes against our own rules of procedure .
some members made a request .
as a group , we feel that this would be a better way forward .
i do not think that we can open a debate on this issue .
i have received a request from the representatives of the two groups concerned .
you have , in fact , made a general comment about an item on the agenda and we shall take note of this .
madam president , it was my group that took the step to make a request about the commission 's statement .
the order of business is thus agreed .
madam president , i come back to my question to you , which i quite obviously raised at entirely the wrong moment .
so my request , as i said , is this : may i put these questions to you , and will you answer them ?
thank you very much . i look forward to your response .
i think , moreover , that after such a long time , there would have been a great deal to say on this issue .
that is all the information that i can give to you .
that is the first point .
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
we must accept it , but we do not agree with it .
"
( applause from the left )
( applause from the left )
( applause from the left )
it is a legal , not a political issue .
madam president , on a point of order .
i shall , of course , do what you have asked me to do .
"
we might improve it , on the other hand , by voting in favour of the amendments that i have just presented .
this is not what the report is about .
the debate is closed .
but never mind !
that is why it is necessary , in my view , to have this debate .
i should like to stress three points in this report that i believe are essential .
having said that , i have four comments to make .
that is not enough .
it is the responsibility of every single one of us .
yet is the situation really still the same ?
should more be done in the field of agriculture ?
there are many other questions as well .
what impact will this have on cooperation with the european parliament ?
that is my first question .
there is a great deal of cause for concern .
the wto is what it is .
that is the stage we are at today .
concerning agriculture , we agree with you .
that is part of our agenda .
secondly , we wish to take development issues into consideration .
we shall return to that matter when the time comes .
the debate is closed .
i do not think so .
this is the proposal i put to you today as your rapporteur .
talk about competition !
it is very important that we continue to support those countries .
i feel that it is necessary to reach agreement on the basic proposal , and we will support this proposal .
in my opinion , this is the key point in this proposal .
i now turn to the content . what are the most important points in the proposal tabled by the commission ?
the debate is closed .
information and communication
that is the problem .
they do exist .
today they do not know whether they will still exist next year .
in my view there is much more to be done in this field .
i doubt it .
you said your ' colleagues responsible for the matter .
who are they ?
we do not know them . we would like to know who they are .
there is no clear strategy .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we are fully aware of the nature of these difficulties .
mr president , i very much welcome what the commissioner has said , for three reasons .
therefore we need to take action very quickly .
this must be done now .
i do not believe that this will be the last time that we discuss this matter in this parliament .
i would so like to believe this , from our position in the here and now .
we therefore have to avoid a situation that would lead to new problems within the union .
why ?
thank you , commissioner , for your response to the questions .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
decision on urgent procedure
agenda
therefore , with the agreement of the other institutions , i propose the following change to the agenda for tomorrow 's sitting :
we discussed this yesterday .
that is clear .
it is a fundamental parliamentary right .
( parliament approved the amendment to the agenda )
that has not been the case up to now but it is included in my report .
it is important that we deal with this matter .
it is therefore urgent , ladies and gentlemen , that this initiative , which we have been discussing for several months , should become reality as soon as possible .
what would we do in the same situation ?
that is our own responsibility .
this is good .
absolutely all of them know it .
i do not believe , however , that we are going to stop them through this kind of measure .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , the european commission has done a good job .
i naturally hope that these will be adopted by this house .
to that extent , you are also responsible for it .
we must ensure that appropriate provisions are in place .
however , my group has tabled an amendment to bring that forward .
we do not believe that three months is acceptable .
when they are in member states they have the right to asylum and protection .
it was solidarity with ourselves .
that is how matters stand , however .
there is a need for solidarity in this world , not with ourselves but with the world outside .
mr president , i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the effort he has made to improve this report .
the european union must act as one on this .
i believe so .
this is a further step by the european union in the fight against terrorism .
we have not heard the last of this .
of course we share our responsibility .
we have to .
and we know that the european parliament is extremely concerned with this principle .
i cannot guarantee that the system will work .
so you know what i am talking about .
the debate is closed .
and
furthermore , the legal objective of the initiative is now quite clear .
but the community needs a legal basis for such action .
no to these three initiatives .
we must guarantee that freedom of movement .
perhaps there is no institutional framework ?
this policy will include common principles , together with common standards and measures .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
welcome
we welcome this .
there is another reason why we are going to vote against the motion .
the debate is closed .
vote
they should at least tell us now how they stand in relation to this , before we carry on voting .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
president .
the council does not wish to speak .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the same procedure applies .
the rapporteur has asked for the floor .
this is not a sustainable solution .
the present european agricultural policy is no longer appropriate to our times .
the european citizens will understand this .
we believe that the eu must open its agricultural sector to the developing world .
i welcome it .
why did not you take action a year , two years ago , at the time of the crisis ?
why is this ?
the present proposal for a directive does not address these matters .
with the european agriculture model , we have a common agricultural policy in mind .
i certainly hope that transparency and democracy come into play .
madam president , i would also like to thank the commissioner for all the effort she has put into these negotiations .
i have my own view on this , and , no doubt , you do as well .
so what will the next the stage be ?
madam president , i am pleased that there has been an agreement .
there was a demand for this system .
madam president , this has been a very hard and long process , and it is not over yet .
i certainly hope that this is the case .
that is not what we want .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report .
however , i support the regulation which is before us today .
we therefore welcome the support the rapporteur has given to this initiative .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
despite this , we have still tabled a few amendments to his report .
we know that a change in the treaty is needed for this .
it is a difficult matter .
in this connection , the commission should avoid any conflict of interest .
so , what we have before us today is a good report .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work that he has carried out .
i would like to express my concern about this position , for which i have two reasons .
the commission must be in a position to help us to achieve our aim .
we must do our best to protect it .
parliament and the relevant institutions should do precisely that .
i would therefore like to comment on a few points that have been mentioned in the debate .
this is a positive point that should be take into account in further discussions .
no one can have any political interest in doing that .
this question is certainly still open .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
public access to environmental information
in all cases , however , a reply is required as soon as possible .
mr president , commissioner , information is a basic principle of democracy .
mr president , it is good that we have so many environmental reports here today .
" .
that is why this proposal for a greater right to information on the environment is so important .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
part i
that is the procedure .
thank you for the information you have just given us , commissioner .
commissioner , i should like to know whether , under the measures you referred to , direct aid to farmers is already being provided or will soon be .
in the 2001 budget we have no additional funds available for use as direct aid to farmers , for example .
within that framework , national support may be provided by the member states .
) mr president , i just put two very specific questions to the commissioner .
in addition to that , some sectors have established their own systems , but only members or partners of those organisations have access to those systems .
however , it is its job to ensure there is proper competition in the eu market .
i fully share much of what she says .
secondly you can use the european framework .
however , i do not particularly thank him for the reply which he has given me .
what is going to happen ?
what is going to happen ?
turkey needs to take a clear stand on this matter .
thank you , mr president .
that proposal from myself was adopted by the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy and by parliament .
mr president , may i thank the honourable member for making that point .
the position of parliament on this question is no different to those of the commission and the council .
however , i should still like to ask you about two specific points .
secondly , how do these organisations get access to funds ?
is there information available on how they do that ?
would it be possible to bring forward proposals such as that ?
thank you , commissioner .
the commission was recently given the opportunity to show its concern about this matter .
one member state has already done so .
i shall try to answer all three questions at the same time .
thank you for your answer , commissioner .
mr president , first of all i should like to congratulate the commissioner for her commitment in this area and to thank her for that .
could i ask the commissioner for her opinion on such an approach ?
certainly not .
commissioner , i would like to thank you very much indeed .
this is a very important point .
i mentioned them earlier and i do not wish to go back to them .
mr president , thank you so much for giving me the floor .
that plan did not work .
is that so ?
the approach is right .
that is , of course , if the member states have the will to do so .
the proposal has now reached its second reading .
we have a long way to go yet .
but the green group would like to know who will then be responsible for this .
that is something we are really all agreed on .
now it is time to put this strategy into effect . that is what this directive is about .
we are on the right road .
let me turn to the key issues under discussion .
i should like to make a short comment on the other proposed amendments .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
member states therefore have to do something about it .
thank you , mr president .
parliament was right , then , to back the commission .
but at second reading we are in a rather different position .
it will go no further , it says .
so i have accepted that this is as far as we can go for the time being .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i believe we have an important report before us .
overall , a good environment and better health do not lead to unemployment .
the commission can , however , accept amendments nos 11 and 12 .
that is perhaps important information .
the commission can accept fully amendment no 2 and can accept in part and in principle amendment no 3 .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it did not .
they may in the end be able to reach the standards that they agree to , but we have to ask how long this will take .
as i say , the member states were against this .
there was simply no proper dialogue between the institutions .
i just hope we can all do better next time .
we will put pressure on member states .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
there are two further amendments on this .
this is not a job for parliament .
but seriously , we must consider first of all the whole way in which this work is to be carried out .
this is an important directive .
it has been asked why this proposal has been put forward .
in conclusion , the commission can accept amendments nos 1 and 2 .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we can , of course , begin with this parliament .
there is therefore every good reason to return to these issues .
the second issue is the protection of resources .
transport is , of course , a particularly difficult area and action is needed .
it is therefore essential that an effective strategy be developed .
in my opinion , the european parliament also has to act as a model .
we all agree that it is a good thing .
mr president , the commission has given us a good basis for discussion .
the question is how we can implement it all .
the second problem i should like to address concerns administrative matters .
why ?
the commission may present this directive soon , and i look forward to your contribution to it .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thank you very much .
it has come to my attention that was not the case earlier this week .
'
then it is , of course , also important to return to the question of form , the best way in which we can reform the union 's institutions and way of working .
a strong europe requires strong institutions .
i look forward to being involved in the debate next week .
madam president , what kind of europe do we , the citizens of europe , want ?
what do we want to do together ?
what will our plan be ?
do we want more integration or not ?
do we or do we not want a more political europe ?
i will add another question : how do we reform the community model ?
even though the candidate countries are not yet members of the european union , they soon will be in a matter of years .
the future of this union , therefore , concerns them here and now as much as it does existing member states .
having said that , many questions remain open .
and we ourselves are working on this .
what is unacceptable today will be even more so in the future .
madam president , 2001 is the year of public debate .
of course we do .
how must this be done ?
the important issue is how to get there .
mr president , i have two things to say .
my second point concerns content .
the idea is to establish a democratic dialogue .
it is vital that european institutions get this opportunity right .
so let us look at the future debate .
first , its nature .
you were not talking about democracy .
( applause )
that is what the citizens expect from you .
thank you .
i will give an example .
mr president , madam president-in-office of the council , you used the word strong three times in your speech .
it means more integration , not less integration .
the issue here , as far as i am concerned , is the application of parliamentary democracy to policy on europe .
what needs to be done ?
finally , madam president , you mentioned citizens .
well , they were anything but strong on the day .
this is essential if we want to clear the air for the debate .
let us take note of this .
do we want a more or a less political europe ?
what does the real future look like on paper ?
what is it you really want ?
what is it you stand for ?
where do we stand with the council ?
naturally , we also need to carry the member states with us and agree on this .
then there is the major question of the next intergovernmental conference .
who is to be involved - member states , candidate countries and organisations , and if so , which ?
we cannot reach a final position on this today .
let me now comment on some other issues .
i think it is important that , here too , parliament is really involved in the debate on content .
this is naturally an important debate for the future .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
madam president , we have just discussed the future of europe .
it is about full employment within the eu .
it is about social and economic reforms .
we need a balance between social and economic reforms .
we hope that agreement on this will be achieved at the summit .
in this context , external trade policy is also important - free and fair world trade is in the interest of european consumers .
this is in our common interest .
let me say just a little more about these two issues , which i consider to be particularly important .
this also applies to almost all the candidate countries as well as the member states .
we must therefore take action now .
nevertheless , the european union , and the commission in particular , does have a responsibility in this field .
nevertheless , we have to establish an overall framework , and this can only be done at european union level .
if we want to become the world 's best economy , we have to ask ourselves a few questions .
we can do better in many areas .
we support this project but we would like to draw your attention to the needs of our citizens .
meeting the needs of our citizens is therefore crucial .
my second comment is about the instruments .
this is good .
these are two different things .
we have been talking here this morning about high technology and it seems we still have some way to go .
so how will that work ?
what happened ?
not a thing !
the council did not adopt a common position .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen , for your attention .
mr president , i would like to present the house with a point of order .
how can this happen ?
vote
before the vote :
mr president , on this report the commission is able to accept amendments nos 2 , 11 and 12 .
before the vote :
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
' ' who 's that ?
' ' me who ?
furthermore , significant progress has been made in this area ;
this is why i am voting in favour of this report .
for this reason , we supported the rapporteur 's line in the vote and voted for amendment no 10 .
i feel the time has come to change that .
for all these reasons , i voted against the report .
i therefore hope to be able to vote soon for the protection of the community 's social security interests .
however , despite these concerns , i have voted in favour of the report and i congratulate the rapporteur .
we in the european parliament should support him in his role .
and why , colleagues , is that ?
but what did she mention ?
it is the right course to follow for progress to be made at european level .
to simply talk about structural reforms does not mean very much ; we need to know which reforms we are talking about .
nothing less than that .
secondly : full employment , to us , means quality jobs .
that was a year ago .
that is a very serious issue .
not content with trying to control us at home , he is trying to do that in europe as well .
allow me to comment on some of the issues .
that is , in fact , what this whole debate has been about .
i cannot understand this .
the debate is closed .
the eu has a key role to play in this regard .
therefore , development work has a key role .
he has raised an important debate .
let me be clear .
third and last , we have to develop more effective coordination .
this is , i think , an important point .
i think that is an important political point .
if we move in this direction , it will , i think , be a positive development .
i would like to start on a practical note .
and that has not always been europe 's strong point , not now or in the past .
now , experience has shown us that there are certain problems to be considered .
our support cannot therefore be total .
this is the situation we find ourselves in .
we must avoid going down that road at all cost .
thank you , madam president-in-office , commissioner , for the information you have already given us .
what can an international organisation do ?
we say we are going to improve all this and let us hope that we do .
more must be done to protect children .
we talk about peace , war and security but we do not know what to do .
what use has it been able to make of these reports ?
has it been of use to you ?
nor did the council .
the idea , like the need , is still there .
this is a fact of life and it makes an excellent contribution to stability in the region .
i hope we can in future .
the debate is closed .
all three institutions have a contribution to make here .
in this regard , the council and the european parliament already follow established rules .
that goes without saying .
i should like to say a word on the question of whether democracy costs time .
i cannot agree with that .
this is not acceptable .
there is no consumer risk .
this does not happen in europe .
would this not be the right time to ask ourselves whether this is not a necessary course of action here too ?
we must know how much it will cost .
the priority is to get out of the crisis .
it is not enough !
a stop must be put to this system .
where will the money come from ?
and if so , how ?
that is something at least .
could the commission tell me whether it is under control ?
could i also ask what the eu is doing ?
measures have economic and political costs and i would like to know from the council and the commission which of these costs they are prepared to meet .
are you prepared to increase aid measures in all the countries of the european union ?
what position will you adopt in relation to third countries ?
a number of different issues were raised .
this is an important issue .
that is an important issue to be taken into account .
transport was another issue that was raised .
a number of you asked the question " is this under control ? " .
it remains to be seen , however , how long this will take .
i must stress this .
a number of people have asked why the commission does not bring forward more proposals .
the legislation is there .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
mr president , i had the first question .
i hope that it does not happen again .
so a great deal is being done .
i would like to thank the council for that answer .
voting in elections is the citizens ' opportunity to show what they want europe 's development to look like .
this is the question to which i would like a specific answer .
i think that i have been quite clear .
we expect great things of you which is why we ask a lot .
of course , like more and more things , this could be completely out of the control of parliament , completely intergovernmental .
what do you think ?
was the commission 's reply wrong ?
i have no reason to in any way review the reply the commission might have given earlier regarding this matter .
has the council no position at all on this ?
in short , we have a legislative problem .
so i cannot comment on that .
i now come to the matter of transparency , which has been raised by a number of members of parliament .
the procedures set out in this report are not intergovernmental .
so it is not an intergovernmental committee .
that is a purpose i share .
she is right .
firstly , the commission will take full account of a resolution approved by parliament .
that is the second point .
that is the third point .
the commission cannot and will not do so .
i cannot speak for the council .
after all , a single majority vote is almost never mentioned in the treaty .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
european economy
we also have a few demands .
we need to step up efforts in education and training .
the social market economy is more than just an economic model .
but that is by the by .
mr president , the european economy is still doing well .
why ?
here too , we lack initiatives .
some of you have also raised the concern that employment is the fundamental issue .
the labour market must be another of our main concerns if we wish to make progress on employment .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i hope these amendments are supported tomorrow by the other political groups .
transparency is all we demand in parliament .
the technical nature of this issue should make this possible .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
in what way ?
another fundamental point is the need for institutional coordination between the european parliament , the commission and the council .
throughout our negotiations on this issue we have had very good cooperation .
i would like in particular to comment on a few issues raised by the report .
we have to encourage and support the country in this .
our demands of that country should be the government 's own .
there are also problems there with the implementation of a market economy .
this is something the rapporteur also referred to in his speech .
it is so important now for the european union to improve the focus and implementation of its strategy .
this is a good report .
i congratulate the rapporteur .
we welcome that .
they make clear how far there still is to go .
i congratulate the honourable member on his report .
the debate is closed .
i do not think it is necessary to say anything further on that because the commission and parliament have done a great deal of work in that direction in the last few months .
the other important issue is the role of public authorities .
but we should not do that .
the commission has quite rightly taken action , and so it must .
but we need something more .
did we have any representatives at the meeting ?
we need to work more quickly .
it is a new technology and it is only a good new technology if a lot of people can use it .
we simply do not take time to stop and think about it .
at the same time i wish to thank the members of parliament for this debate .
the commission obviously cannot do everything on its own .
thank you all once again !
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
water management
on water management in europe .
almost three years after the vote on this resolution , questions are still being asked .
' much of the policies , legislation and standards needed to achieve our objectives for water quality and use have already been put in place .
would you like an example ?
let us do so .
the debate is closed .
this is for later , after proper debate .
i ask my colleagues in parliament to give this report their full support .
this also applies to the situation in the developing countries .
it will be very important to guarantee competition .
there must also be public control of the research .
but it is not all about growth .
i think it is a good report .
such things exist .
that is also something we need to understand .
we live in a democracy .
what have we seen in that time ?
this is shown not least by the very large majority in support of the report in committee .
thank you very much , commissioner .
mr president , i must say that with his report the honourable member has taken an excellent first step towards a new discussion in europe .
they must be allowed to change to green .
the policy paper and action plan will be the commission 's response to parliament 's wish for an initiative .
i expect the european council will take a very strong position on this issue .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
ladies and gentlemen , you accepted the rule that i put before you , in other words , to deal with points of order after voting .
vote
we shall look into this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i consider that this situation is unacceptable and that measures should be adopted to ensure that this cannot happen .
why do they have to pay tax ?
i have said it before and i will say it again , jobs , jobs , jobs . that is what it is all about .
that is why i wanted to vote against our resolution .
i have therefore voted against the report .
we are voting against it .
this is not true democracy .
that is why i voted against this report .
i would like to discuss three aspects .
there must be clear rules about this .
of course price is important .
but that is still not enough .
so a great deal of money is needed , and also a new initiative .
i think there are some very specific things which can be done .
these are the words we must use .
do i have to answer ?
can you answer with me ?
commissioner , the european union must act here .
i also asked you about this during the previous debate in this house .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
human rights
no !
we need to do something about it .
this is therefore something we need to work on .
this is unacceptable .
i shall not do this !
we call once again for this to be done .
the joint debate is closed .
in order to do this we propose various points in the resolution .
the joint debate is closed .
europe should lead the way in this respect .
this is a good cause , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , for the commission and the european union to adopt .
the joint debate is closed .
i welcome this decision .
this year we are being presented with amendments to the text .
this first step was achieved thanks to the decision to which i have referred .
i happened to be the commissioner responsible at the time .
as you know , however , this proposal was not accepted by the council .
i think that today , however , we should be clear about what our objectives are .
thank you . we look forward to them .
what is the current state of play ?
so , here we are .
what can be done ?
give us a legal basis .
i welcome this .
mr president , commissioner , everything has been said .
when the european parliament 's committee on employment and social affairs took the decision to put this question to you , it had three objectives .
we have done that .
vote
president .
statement by the president
agenda
president .
president .
i believe parliament should make a statement on this .
this also applies to the council .
the order of business is thus adopted .
thank you very much .
i think that you must be aware of what you want .
investment services
the next item is the joint discussion on the following reports :
the commission communication is not a legislative text .
in europe we have many more than one .
just to have a good and relevant directive will not be enough .
madam president , i welcome and support both the reports we are discussing today .
two further points , which have also already been mentioned , are of concern to me here .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
and is it ?
in response , many in this house will say with me : no it is not .
is this true ?
no , it is not .
i would never want this .
this is unacceptable .
after all , we also need to go into the second reading with something to play for .
naturally we need to ensure that products are free of risk to the consumer .
i agree entirely with the rapporteur .
if they can , then change is needed .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and the work of the committee .
it is not .
the development of these over the last few years has been a major step forward .
that is not the case at all .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good report .
there was also a very good debate in committee .
we have to set a date and keep to it .
we cannot know about the wto .
we have to keep the pressure on .
let me do so .
we have already discussed this in committee .
if this is not possible then they will just have to take those which are already available .
you are right !
' no !
nor is there any doubt about public opinion on this issue .
this cannot be done by one part of industry alone .
the debate is closed .
i would like to make this quite clear .
the case of lead is quite different .
for this we shall need legislation at european level .
this might well be the case .
what measures will we be taking ?
whose interests come first ?
we have therefore tabled only a few amendments .
we should not be taken in by this .
mr president , i welcome this report as a very important first step in what is going to be a very important debate .
this is the beginning of a very long debate before we reach the stage of legislation .
i think that we have a great deal more to do here .
where legislation is concerned we always say that we need to make progress quickly and that we need to know what 's what .
we also welcome the commission 's new stress on coordination rather than on legislation .
we should also be dealing with the tax problems , as i said just now .
he mentioned social aspects and so on .
we have already had a discussion .
this will be coming back to parliament at a later date .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( applause from the left )
so that is the end of this item .
( parliament approved the minutes )
decision on urgent procedure
what we have here is an old demand made by parliament finally taking effect .
i call on the house to vote for this request .
( parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i would like to start with enlargement .
i would like to mention two areas which are important to me in that respect .
we hope to set a good example .
i will , however , say a few words on the council 's budget .
transparency of the european safety and defence policy 's expenditure is too important .
why ?
that is why we are concerned .
we believe that this is important in order to prevent the problems which we have had in previous years .
the other institutions do not agree .
this will not be the central issue .
another thing i would like to mention is information technology and sustainable energy in the development budget .
( applause from the right )
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to present the priorities of the committee on economic and monetary affairs for the 2002 general budget .
the same also applies to the commission , of course .
( applause )
that is free .
it does not cost anything .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today we are discussing the budget guidelines .
in other words , we are discussing the political priorities we wish to set in the budget for the coming year .
this is not acceptable .
that is just not on .
it does not have an impact on the budget .
justice and home affairs policy does not have an impact on the budget .
that is simply a matter of fact .
i would , however , also like to mention the subject of administrative budgets .
these are issues that we should certainly be discussing this year , and this naturally has an impact on the budget .
the wto will also have budgetary consequences for us in 2002 .
this is an area in which we have , in the past , been successful in europe , in the european union .
people have a right to expect us to fight hard against unemployment .
my next point is the common foreign and security policy .
that should be an important priority for us .
the 2002 budget guidelines clearly show the budgetary policy the european parliament is to adopt .
one particular problem is the agricultural budget .
the priority is no longer additional money , but rather fundamental reform .
but this is not just about more money .
there is an urgent need for reform in various external policy areas .
this is a considerable problem which has been around for years .
however , i do share the rapporteur 's view that something needs to be done .
these are essential .
we all know that new authorities need additional budgetary resources , but that these are hard to come by .
mr president , first of all i want to say that we very often discuss the budget as if it were an end in itself .
this is extremely important .
it is still there .
we do not know to which countries this will apply , or how many of them there will be .
mr president , i would like to draw your attention to two areas .
allow me to begin with the fisheries sector .
and why do we support this objective ?
that is the number one priority .
why it has not yet been fully used and what should its future be ?
we cannot compromise on environmental standards in those areas .
there are two other important issues which i want to bring to the attention of the commission .
we need a new initiative from the commission on this .
i hope the commission has heard what we say .
for my part i would like to offer full cooperation so that we get a good budget and good budget implementation in 2002 .
these funds are made available for the new enlargement countries , so if there is no enlargement , this funding is , of course , not made available .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
so that is the legal position .
so far , so good .
members are having to fight for their parliamentary rights as regards the framework legislation on financial services .
we are having to fight over human resources for the common foreign and security policy .
these amendments increase the possibility of such a dialogue and must therefore be accepted .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thank you .
i would like to address just three particular matters of concern .
therefore , it will be a great moment , for parliament as well as the commission , when we put it to the vote tomorrow .
we have received a lot of information this year .
agricultural policy is a good example .
i have other things to say , but i shall return to these at the end of the debate .
i hope that this will be the procedure from now on .
how do they impact on legislation ?
the information is not now available .
but this is a clear decision , and i have the full support of the committee on budgetary control .
vote
does any member wish to speak against this proposal ?
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote on amendment no 2
" the change is in the word " continue " .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is an extremely important issue .
it is extremely serious .
madam president , i should be very pleased if the european commission were given more money for its budget .
firstly , agriculture .
secondly , enlargement .
what about the others though ?
this was hard work for everyone concerned .
in case of doubt the commission must decide .
" the short answer is " no !
the clear objective of the administrative reform of the commission is to improve financial management .
the committee on foreign affairs has therefore made it a priority to ensure that the decisions adopted by this house are also implemented .
mr president , culture is certainly not a high priority for parliament or the commission .
1999 - what a year that was .
what conclusions should we draw from this ?
you simply will not .
1999 is not the year for which this commission is responsible .
the commission has taken us seriously .
i would , however , like to draw your attention to a number of aspects .
this reform does not only apply to the european commission , but also to the council and parliament .
the other institutions should take a long and hard look at this too .
i would like to make a few general points .
that is very positive .
we are aware that this is the last year for which the commission can say that it was not responsible .
the situation in 1999 was different .
it was hard to say which of them was responsible for what .
i shall make three comments on what has happened here this year .
that does not always happen .
but this means that a change of approach is sometimes required too .
i can understand that .
what are these issues ?
will i finally get a clear statement from you today ?
but i think it is appropriate to point this out .
a word to the commission .
you are absolutely right on this point .
then he should come .
we have an entirely different responsibility .
but i should mention at the same time that this is a council regulation .
it remains to be seen how the debate on this issue will continue .
i have to make this clear , because the new programme could not be approved and implemented in all areas .
that goes without saying .
the debate is closed .
there has been a very high level of solidarity and cooperation between member states in the current difficult circumstances .
i will now turn to community measures in relation to individual member states .
i would now like to turn to two other important measures adopted in recent days .
but the reality is far different .
i would therefore like to ask the commission the following questions .
what are the effects on markets in europe ?
i would now like to draw your attention to another aspect .
i therefore feel that the initiatives implemented to date are not sufficient .
what did the negotiations achieve ?
the european union must adopt a strong position on regional policy .
so , what do we do ?
what will need to be done ?
( applause from the right )
however , before we reach that stage , i would like to mention the problems that we need to deal with now .
i hope it is .
we therefore have to look to the future .
i take an entirely different view .
so now is the time for you to adopt a different course of action .
try it and see .
commissioner , thank you for your contribution .
people in my country no longer accept this .
instead , he did nothing .
commissioner , the situation is very serious indeed .
it is being asked for today in this house .
i would ask the commissioner three questions .
what you cannot do is address both issues in the same way .
this is unacceptable .
we should do this today , and not tomorrow .
all these aspects should therefore be considered .
there will be more time for those later .
then the council can decide , and the council can take responsibility for its policies .
thank you .
i have had this in my mind since the very beginning .
we do not have that yet .
i agree fully with that point .
let me deal with some of the individual questions .
trade was allowed from the free areas .
it is in every respect quite a different issue .
that is not so .
it is something that consideration should be given to .
that is the point i was making earlier .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
president .
thank you very much , commissioner .
do you not think that specific measures need to be adopted ?
mr president , commissioner , you know that as the rapporteur on this issue , this is of great interest to me .
when you see the communication you will see the level of decision which each of the member states has reached and the amount of information available at a national level .
the national programmes are all being discussed in the commission .
i believe that , on the whole , things are going well .
we still have a few months left .
i think there is a significant need for action in this area .
thank you very much , commissioner .
this item is closed .
question time ( commission )
part one
this is a proposal that we have supported and which is currently being put into practice .
what is the commission 's position on this matter ?
it is therefore quite acceptable that these research projects form part of this objective .
i would thank the commissioner for his answer .
the management committee will now meet and make a decision .
i hope that the proposal will be approved , so that it can be implemented during 2001 .
all of them expressed their commitment to democracy .
all of them expressed their commitment to dialogue .
i would like to go further than that , if i may .
but i want to go further .
we must do all we can in the european union to make sure that the future is very different indeed .
they are making a greater effort .
it is a difficult job but one which i hope they will be able to do even better .
i could have referred to the eu statement in the un commission on human rights as well .
let us hope that this report , together with the employment directive , will address that issue .
we must look at all the issues .
this is something which is possible to implement , because it is about changes to the environment .
we can implement changes .
i myself come from the world of education .
mr president , have you seen how we all agree on this issue ?
this second objective of equal access means specific policies for 12 % of europe 's citizens .
the debate is closed .
this will ensure that all the objectives are achieved in the best way possible .
in view of the above , amendments have been proposed so that the objectives of the programme can be achieved .
here , i support the rapporteur 's proposed amendment .
mr president , today is our first reading of one of the most important matters of concern to the citizens of europe , the action programme for public health .
we think this is essential .
public health is national policy , and it should remain that way .
we must guarantee that this proposal , which will last for the next five years , is effective .
after all , colleagues , the european elections are not far away .
these are matters for the member states .
therefore , this amendment is acceptable only in part .
without any doubt the issue is a priority for the three institutions in this process .
let me be very clear about our position on this .
the decision on this is for the council and the european parliament , as the budgetary authority .
therefore the commission can accept these amendments .
therefore i can only accept it in part .
many of the amendments will improve this proposal .
the debate is closed .
firstly , the problem of community legislation .
i think that the commission needs to pay greater attention to this fact in its activities in future .
mr president , may i thank you once again for giving me the floor to reply to some of the comments made by members .
i cannot see it that way .
the treaty is clear .
it did not do so without reason .
naturally the commission does not , in the end , decide what the legal situation is .
that is the responsibility of the court of justice .
that is what the commission has done .
that is the reason why it has taken some member states to court .
i was asked if i would issue a directive .
there is no need for a directive .
we have a treaty .
so we do not need a directive .
the debate is closed .
statement by the president
this question must therefore also become a priority issue for the union .
our discussions must address these too .
the first issue is the creation of an internal european market for financial services .
this is important .
our transport ministers will be discussing the issue further tomorrow .
as i said earlier , it is a step in the right direction but not as far as we would like to get .
the second aspect of the process is the social agenda .
within the framework of open coordination this too should be something which we discuss together .
firstly , our relations with russia .
our main discussion , however , concerned financial development in russia and opportunities for economic cooperation between russia and the european union .
we will give russia every support in this process .
when it does the union must also be prepared to take on its responsibility .
we believe that our agriculture ministers have already done so .
it is thus this process which we must keep to .
i would now like to move on to the debate on the economic and social agenda taking place in the european council .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
but that is not the point right now .
( applause )
i wish this success on both you and us .
( applause )
i congratulate him on this agreement .
despite that , i believe we are on the right road .
that is the only way to peace .
we therefore need to change direction on development , so as to make it more sustainable and give it more solidarity .
this is something of which the public in our countries should be aware .
my second question concerns enlargement .
but where are they when it comes to the financial action plan and the regulation of investment markets ?
both the commission and the council really can help in this regard and i call on them to do so .
these are two different areas of policy .
he is right .
it must have been an extremely difficult situation to deal with .
this is a crucial point for us .
how will this ensure its sustainable development in future ?
i have a second question .
the third point that i wish to address concerns the council itself .
it is important that we have achieved this .
this was the first stage of a process which will go on for many years .
i should like to ask the president of the council the following .
my second question concerns the following .
there is this draft framework directive .
this is certainly not the europe that we want to have .
it is also a question of legislation .
we are aware that not all of us within the union agree on every issue , but on this issue we are agreed .
when we are able to put forward common principles , we must naturally also act together .
this is what this is about .
this is a clear commitment made by parliament and all of us .
this does not have to be the case at all .
we have a commitment from the main european companies in this sector .
president .
i welcome the progress made thus far .
vote
( parliament adopted the proposal )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote :
we discussed this quite clearly during the vote in committee .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
, rapporteur .
( parliament adopted the decision )
i am the rapporteur for all amendments .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
therefore , it is important that we get this proposal through as quickly as possible .
i look forward to the second reading .
we have therefore voted against the report .
the european parliament 's rapporteur takes the same line as the commission .
we support the rapporteur 's action on this proposal , on two points .
this is not the case , however .
we will not , therefore , be able to have a good public health programme until we change this situation ;
why is that ?
because i hope that the commission will make much , much greater efforts .
according to the rapporteur 's own information , this applies here .
i do not support them .
we cannot have everything : therefore , let us hear less of the national states , and more of the regions and more of europe .
"
"
this is another important fundamental change .
it is unacceptable .
i hope that they will make use of it for the good of europe .
mr president , a decision with serious consequences for europe and its information society will be taken tomorrow .
fundamental questions and less than three months to go .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
area of freedom , security and justice
the next item is the joint debate on
and
the second issue is freedom .
this is a very relevant area which we are discussing today .
it is important that we focus on what is important and really focus our time and energy on the central issues of eu development .
the conditions for immigration to our countries change over time .
i shall start with the last point . you have my support here , commissioner .
finally , i should like to mention one more thing .
but the citizens do not know .
parliament - and i am sure in this respect the citizens too - will follow .
these are not national problems .
however , that is not the case .
what we will need is an assessment of the impact of measures taken .
member states must understand that this is an area in which citizens want more europe .
mr president , in view of the short time available , i will address the most important point first .
we look forward to the proposals which the commission will present in this field .
at the moment , there are different policies in different countries .
freedom , security , justice - but there is no such thing !
is this freedom ?
i call on the commission , the council and the governments of the european union to apply this policy and put it into practice .
europe does not just need an economic face , it also needs a human face .
why do we not all focus on this programme ?
for this we need a clear political will and sufficient budgetary funding .
but why has this happened ?
it is thus our hope that we will be able to make decisions in may .
this is true both at national and at international level .
it is in everyone 's interest for the cooperation to work and be effective .
the same applies to the cooperation between the member states , the council , the european parliament and the commission .
let us all work together to that end .
the debate is closed .
we must also be clear .
from this point of view it is important that the role of each party should be clear .
this is absolutely wrong .
finally , we must do everything we can to prevent conflict .
this is absolutely unacceptable .
i would like to list a few of these initiatives .
mr president , i would like to make three comments in response to the debate .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken tomorrow .
question time ( council )
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
but to get back to the point of my question .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
i should like to thank the president-in-office for his response and would like to give him some information of which he may not be aware .
allow me to mention two things .
the council has not had opportunity to discuss this matter .
again , i am not in a position to be able to give any direct answer to the question put by the honourable member of parliament .
no , we do not .
the president of the council is not in a position to comment on the individual case brought up by the honourable member of parliament .
once this has been approved by the council and european parliament it will provide a framework for sustainable production .
' 1 .
2 .
the commission has not yet put forward any proposal or other initiative in the matter for discussion by the council .
does the council of ministers share this view ?
how is it possible that the council did not know ?
but , as i say , the council has no role to play in this matter , and this is a question time with questions to the council .
mr president , the president-in-office says that it is not the council 's responsibility but that of the member states .
but what is the council if it is not the member states ?
of course , i would like to take the opportunity to welcome the green paper on the review of the common fisheries policy , which is all important , particularly to my own country .
what is the council 's response to these conclusions ?
practical measures are being taken within the community too .
what does the decision mean for the world community ?
you will understand that i do not share their views .
that is new .
this is a good thing .
the debate is closed .
not at all .
to end with , what can be said about external costs ?
and that is precisely the objective here .
what i mean is that , when it comes to questions such as " what are external costs ?
i shall refer to some of them .
the debate is closed .
then the council took its time .
i think that , on balance - even if it has taken a long time - we have done a good job .
i think this was achieved very well .
what is parliament here for ?
that is now being put right .
we will all benefit from this decision but we must look to the future .
the debate is closed .
we have an important item on our agenda today .
the second problem is the council and , at present , there is no solution to it .
europe is only at the start of the process .
we know that .
i would like members to keep that in mind .
i cannot .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i shall do my best .
so much for this aspect .
at the end of the day , however , too little use is made of these instruments .
it is a proposal on two levels .
not only for criminal affairs , but just as much for civil and trade affairs .
the debate is closed .
i will come back to this in tomorrow 's debate .
tomorrow morning we will have the opportunity to discuss this aspect .
thank you very much , commissioner .
many thanks , mr president , for giving me the opportunity .
the debate is closed .
how and where are the points set ?
that is precisely what europe is doing .
and this will , and should not , change in the future .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
there are already issues which concern people all over europe .
just think of the euro , its internal stability and its external value .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
make use of the opportunity which you have to take europe forward .
help to make europe real for the citizens of our countries .
you have already done so much .
keep up the good work .
i am with you all the way !
( applause )
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this is now our task .
back , however , to the first issue .
that may have brought about more movement in the direction we now want to go in .
this too has our full support .
so what does the commission propose in the face of this ?
my view is that the common position by the commission is excellent .
but the legislation is present .
thank you , commissioner .
once again let me make myself clear .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
in my view , we must act in three key areas .
however , we will have to approach the budgetary authority in this connection regarding the 2002 budget .
the next step must be for us to report back to the fisheries council .
it was little more than that , however .
these are the key points .
and we need to ask the european union to make a special effort .
it would be a good thing , however , if that were to happen before the council of fisheries ministers is held .
given the current circumstances , i do not believe it makes any sense .
we are all called upon to do that : the commission , the budgetary authorities , parliament and the council .
the debate is closed .
this is the aim of amendment no 1 of the draft report .
we need a global approach .
the debate is closed .
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , there will be no debate .
welcome
vote
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote on amendment no 3
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
so those amendments are unacceptable .
this is just not the case .
i will therefore give the proposal the benefit of the doubt .
madam president , this issue is an important one at a european level .
' why is that ?
' you may ask , mr president .
that is the connection , mr president .
in principle , this cannot be positive for the future of the transport market .
i call for greater and better attention to these points .
this requires the most urgent attention of everyone in this parliament .
mr president , consumer protection is a matter of great concern to all of us in this house .
we had also asked for this earlier in the european parliament .
but we did not get that far .
we will therefore support this resolution if it is put to the vote .
the joint debate is closed .
more than 20 countries have already done just that .
it is not a question of the environment , or of employment .
it is not jobs or the environment .
this , mr president , is the question we wish to put to the representatives of the commission today .
that is why we must set an example .
this must not happen .
it is completely unacceptable .
the problem is very serious .
it is under development .
this is therefore an important date for us all .
the joint debate is closed .
human rights
commissioner , i turn to you .
is this social justice ?
we are united in solidarity with the victims .
i voted against the proposal .
but above all this is an issue for the state authorities .
this is often not the case with the governments of many member states .
we must make it more difficult in this way .
mr president , europe is not only an economic union , it is also a union of standards and values .
this is the year 2001 .
however , this should not be all that is done .
we naturally also discuss many european issues .
the debate is closed .
this is an example of the practical measures we are taking at the moment .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we need to make safety a priority .
' mr president , first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur for her report .
it is a very important initiative , because safety is a subject of great importance to the fisheries sector as a whole .
. .
. .
the commission can agree with you fully .
as far as your conclusions are concerned , madam rapporteur , i feel there is a need to act in the following areas .
monitoring and control are the main problems .
the debate is closed .
but this is a very serious matter .
i welcome this opportunity to be able to present our policy to parliament on his behalf and to comment on it .
that is what we want to see the commission look at .
that is why i ask colleagues to support the amendments tabled by my group .
commission . ( de ) mr president , i would like to add just a few more comments .
the debate is closed .
agenda
the council did not believe that it was in a position to make this statement .
of course , there would not be much point without the council .
( applause from the left )
i believe i am right in saying that all the political groups were also in favour of this .
( applause from the left )
we have also had a meeting on this subject today .
i particularly wanted to mention that .
( applause )
madam president , i do not know whether our actions over the last two days will be successful .
we can find a solution in two days .
president .
( parliament approved the proposal )
what is the current situation ?
you have access to this document .
i think that you are aware of the situation .
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
you may , of course , make a statement on behalf of your group .
there is only one request where there is some doubt .
this information that i have given you is new and extremely important information .
this is important .
i have said this to you in public and in private .
we also think that it should be the committee on legal affairs and the internal market that should deal with the matter .
unfortunately , ladies and gentlemen , we do not have these powers and what is more , even if we had them , we would not use them .
( applause from the left )
however , i should like to return to the subject of the law .
we need to give it that time .
( applause from the right )
that is very important .
we should get them into parliament as quickly as possible .
i was not making a party political point .
i was making a point on behalf of this parliament .
that is what is unacceptable . we must not accept it .
we have reached the end of this debate .
we shall see what can be done in order to make this possible .
nevertheless , it is an important contribution .
we have to move from projects to programmes .
we need :
i would like to draw this point , in particular , to the attention of parliament .
mr president , i welcome the statement .
it is the best quality support .
mr president , we have taken good note of this decision by the commission .
as regards the humanitarian side , it is quite different .
i would like to thank the commissioner for the statement he has just made .
the eu policy is to move towards regional cooperation and integration .
is that also a policy that the united nations organisations are following and will support ?
things are better now than they used to be .
i have already mentioned protection and security .
i should like to ask the commission how this is done at the moment .
we can do more .
from a human point of view this needs more attention .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
"
finally , this is not the end of the beginning .
for that we would have required rather more time , rather more transparency and some measure of public debate .
secondly , new and better provisions are needed .
it is a proposal of its time .
access must be provided as soon as possible , and no later than within 15 working days .
it is now up to the european parliament to decide .
that is why this is the right time for me to adopt this compromise .
that was not acceptable to us .
all we can do is vote for or against .
in one or two years ' time we will be able to review whether this regulation has really been a success .
i am pleased to see that the basic requirements have been established , even if not in full as yet .
the answer is no .
even though discussions have taken place , the procedure is not especially open .
moreover , the national rules must apply in those countries which have better legislation than that now being proposed .
moreover , a review will take place in a few years ' time .
it is quite clear that we in parliament must vote in favour of this proposal .
people want the institutions to be more open .
it is possible for those countries that wish to do so to go further .
the eu regulation makes the rules the same in every country .
" they tell us . we certainly will .
there is money available for that .
he says that this is something that will develop by itself .
quite a few of us voted for making the eu more open .
this is a reality which we must accept .
let me be clear .
this report does not go as far as i would like .
mr president , parliament is taking an important step today on the road towards the greater transparency which we have been talking about for so many years .
transparency does not come about through legislation alone , however .
we must see how the new rules work .
things move on .
the debate is closed .
welcome
( applause )
under our new agreement , it will be possible for the european union to provide them with the necessary support .
it may be that , had we adopted it earlier , we would have been able to avoid some of the consequences as well .
so , we must continue to make good progress .
this , mr president , is the agreement that has been reached .
mr president , i was just about to say that the issue of information is also fundamental .
you may have a different view of democracy , but everyone can say what they feel needs to be said .
at last , we have an agreement .
but there is more .
the only conclusion we could draw therefore is that more of these agreements are needed in the region in the short term .
this agreement is the right move in the right direction .
only then can there be political stability .
the debate is closed .
nuclear safety is a priority for the european union .
it is not .
is that at least not something we should be able to agree about ?
we can understand that .
and why ?
we must have sustainable energy policies .
nuclear power is no solution .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much for the debate .
i have been asked what standards are applied .
what does that mean ?
thank you for the debate .
the debate is closed
however , those who adopt the euro can be party to decisions on the same conditions as other members .
thank you , mr president .
i shall therefore take it upon myself to do so .
some will say to me that we do not have the money to do that .
therefore , for all of these reasons , the security of our currency is extremely important .
various additional instruments have already been adopted or are currently being prepared .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i completely share that view .
i therefore think that this initiative will not be much help .
the commission has been working in this area for some time .
the debate is closed .
not a lot has happened since in one sense .
it is not .
that could be part of it .
i should like to take this opportunity to ask us to think in the longer term .
all of this is of crucial importance .
but our discussion goes further than that , of course .
we must now take a good look at food production .
the regulation takes account of scientific development .
in this resolution , parliament asked for several protection measures .
the debate is closed .
i am sure the commission has too .
i would not like the job myself .
i will begin with the amendments the commission cannot accept .
therefore i can accept this amendment .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i welcome the commissioner to the house .
"
obviously , these legislative changes will take some time .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
we have certainly taken account of the statement you have just made .
what were they based on back then ?
that is one very good point .
what , however , do we say about it ?
i think that this is the way forward .
this requires a large contribution from public funds .
mr president , i support economic cooperation within the european union .
we want to make both these key projects a real success within the union , and we support enlargement .
the call for more coordination of the economic policy is then not the most effective approach .
under no circumstances , however , should we simply increase public investment .
we shall , of course , be voting against this report .
quite simply , all that happened in ireland was that current regulations were applied .
these were the issues i wanted to bring to your attention .
thank you again .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i hope that it will get the same level of support from the house today .
what do we want to look at and how are we going to achieve it ?
it is clear why we should do it but what do we need to do in that context ?
issues of security and data protection are clearly important .
if we are to create real confidence , i should like to call on the commission to do more here .
there is also a need for good quality content .
there has already been a great deal of talk here about consumer confidence .
specific groups can then receive additional support .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i know my place , and we can therefore make a start on this subject matter .
why do we need that proposal at all ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( applause from the left )
this is an extremely important and serious issue .
this is completely unacceptable .
we have taken note of your statement .
vote
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
relating to amendment no 4
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
what is the commission ?
i know what the parliament is because you have become a member of it .
"
"
for these reasons , we will not be voting in favour of this report .
this is not the case at all .
there was no financial need for it .
let us be clear about one thing .
these members of my group would like to see a few changes in future .
nuclear safety
these measures are all in the right direction .
" i said to her .
"
i should , however , just like to point out that we voted against item 4 .
i have therefore voted against this report .
statement by the president
agenda
the agenda is thus adopted .
thank you very much , madam president .
there is one essential point .
that is the position .
i think that would lead us away from the matter in hand .
i believe that matters are clear at the moment .
moreover , for many of us they have always been clear .
there are , after all , two cases here .
the answer is no .
so far , i have received nothing .
that is the position , and i think i have made it very clear .
no , of course not .
they were able to achieve a lot with their contribution .
finally , the final result is , i believe , better than either the joint position of the council or the final text of parliament .
madam president , we have reached the final stage of this major directive .
i wish that were the case on more matters .
now to come to the point .
we see the results in these areas as major progress .
this will have to be a future task .
there is at least one commitment in this direction for the future .
mr president , i am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this very important subject .
the new regulations being proposed will be a significant step forward .
mr president , i would like to say that i think that this is a very important matter that we were dealing with today and that we must decide on tomorrow .
it is good that we are going to do something about it .
this should have happened earlier , but it is good that there will now be rules .
i do not think that this was necessary , but it was , of course , a political compromise .
they were not true then and they are not true now .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the council has accepted most of the proposals approved by parliament during the first reading .
i think that this is very important .
this will ensure that the commission is able to act at once .
these were included in the common position .
this is also only right .
finally , i would like to make one point , mr president .
so be it , the commission can accept that .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is why we have had to make a few amendments to the common position .
for that reason also it is a good and extremely important programme .
in the joint position , i feel , a good compromise was reached and in any case it is another step in the right direction .
this is a great day for education policy throughout europe .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
on the one hand , on three reports :
mr president , i am sure across this house , and between parliament , the commission and the council , we all agree education is important .
the question we have to address is : what can europe do ?
what results were achieved ?
there are some things that can and should be done at a european level .
i will not deal with that .
i would say , however , that it is not just the commission that can do things .
things cannot be allowed to continue that way !
these things cost money , however .
i am sure that the commissioner will do that .
why ?
for this to be effective sufficient resources have to be made available .
i shall reply later to the discussion on the reports .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i wish to make four points .
the european union has , in fact , always been mean in the budgets for education .
these programmes have their purpose !
i hope we can go this way together .
they also make clear some of the issues which we now face in developing such systems .
it is not just the key to a successful european single market , it is the key to a successful union in its social and political content as well as its economic content .
this is important for the internal market .
i wish that were true , i hope it is true , but what do we want to achieve , where do we want to be in five years ' time and in ten years ' time ?
however , certain programmes can only be carried out from above .
we must make sure that in two years ' time we are not talking about what we wanted to do but were not allowed to .
what is the issue ?
that is what today 's debate is about .
i feel the lack of that debate .
we simply have nothing to say on the subject , have we ?
what is the debate when we are discussing education ?
i fully support this .
i am pleased about that , but at the same time it is not enough .
we are on the right road together .
education policy is therefore the key to the success of economic policy .
we want to develop europe in such a way that all people feel they are involved .
the work is to continue .
mr president , much has been said , and indeed , much has been well said .
that is a long time ago .
that , at least , is a start .
never !
yet this is now being done .
that is far from being the case .
now , we are making progress .
parliament has the right to take its own initiatives .
the first is the principle of access for everyone .
i believe that we need to take this into consideration .
there are a few small problems here and there .
thank you very much , commissioner .
ladies and gentlemen , the joint debate is closed .
mr president , on a point of order .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i was present yesterday .
( the minutes were approved )
this european home market already has a common monetary policy .
what is the present state of play in the european union ?
in this difficult environment , the european central bank is doing an excellent job .
( applause )
the main questions for the european economy , for the european institutions and for the member states remain the same , despite the change in the international environment .
my job was to present parliament with the report on the economic guidelines for 2001 .
we all know the consequences of this approach .
greater coordination is not the answer .
my final point concerns the environment .
let us quickly look at its form .
this is not the view france takes .
what do we mean by that ?
now is the time for it to act .
we shall soon have the opportunity to come back to this subject , when we discuss the communication by the commissioner .
mr president , i would like to make one comment , if i may , on the reform of the labour markets .
that is essential too .
we are part of a global economy .
we expect and demand better .
nevertheless , the guidelines still apply to the union as a whole .
nevertheless , since some of these issues have been raised again in today 's debate , i would like to comment on them once again .
the debate is closed .
this is why i believe it is only right and proper that this directive should see the light of day .
i support this initiative .
i myself come from a country where a number of rules on this subject matter are already in place .
moreover , this is also important in terms of the health of workers .
the directive that is before us today is an important directive .
why ?
that is something i cannot understand .
i think that that is wrong .
i am pleased that that is possible .
i think it is important in the region that i come from , too .
i will mention one example .
for that reason , the decisions we now have to take are particularly important .
with regard to dealing with waste , i think there are three crucial points .
i believe this may become one of the most important points of all .
this is a very important issue .
the aim of the directive is to prevent environmental problems .
there has been a great deal of discussion about the role of the member states .
a second aspect to be considered is that we are doing something entirely new here .
let me answer some of your questions .
it is very important to include them in this kind of system .
we want to establish a high level of protection for the whole of the european union .
i think these were the most important questions raised .
the debate is closed .
. ( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission proposal is based on the common position adopted by the council for a water framework directive .
this , i believe , is our common objective .
all member states and all regions must take action in this area .
our group will not stand in its way .
mr president , i must first of all welcome this report .
the list will be a good , first step on the road to the excellent quality of our water .
my thanks are also due to the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
i can accept these amendments as long as they are in line with the water framework directive .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
vote
before the vote :
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
because you are the rapporteur it makes it difficult , but i cannot accept the request .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
and that is what i have done .
'
since this can only be done within the framework of this proposal , another solution will have to be found .
some amendments were then tabled at second reading to take account of this development .
'
we cannot , therefore , vote in favour of these reports .
in short , there needs to be a proper balance between money and the social life to which we all have the right .
parliament has been asked to give its opinion on this issue .
however , as we all know , this still goes on .
i hope my colleagues will support this report .
what we need to do now is to provide information , especially for young people .
we are not dealing with a regulation or a directive here .
i therefore believe that this is an issue for the european union at european level , and not just an issue at member state level .
it is not a directive or a regulation .
for this reason the amendment is not acceptable .
it makes sense however to accept the reference to the regional and local level .
the debate is closed .
we agreed with the majority of the proposal made to us .
we believe it is very important that there should be specific legislation .
i would now like to turn my attention to a specific problem .
we do not support this .
one is " where appropriate " .
allow me to address the amendments with which the commission cannot agree .
the debate is closed .
i think they might not .
i should like to know whether the view of the commission is that they will agree with the commission 's proposals or not .
it is a very long process .
this is again why i am concerned a little about the report .
at the moment i cannot accept the new amendments tabled .
i have a great concern that we are trying to move away from the real issues here .
in addition to the commission 's proposals , we must therefore be well aware that we are up against a major problem .
may i say to the commission that this is quite enough structural change !
perhaps , commissioner , you could take to this idea .
' what will he reply ?
we are in a period of crisis .
we really have to move forward .
i therefore hope that the commission 's proposal will be adopted .
the debate is closed .
sustainable development strategy
the next item is the commission communication on the sustainable development strategy .
we also wish to place sustainable development on the agenda of all the international institutions .
secondly , that all policies have sustainable development as their central concern .
in that way , europe could do something for the environment outside europe , and that is a practical initiative .
in any case , we still have a long way to go before we reach that point .
a lot can be achieved but clearly it has to be done step by step .
will the commissioner tell me what he is going to do about that ?
the process , however , is very long .
i hope that this principle will always be applied .
the global level was also mentioned , and i think it good that we should clearly single out that too .
i have two questions .
first : what do you think you can really do under these circumstances ?
second : what form should a debate with citizens take ?
what do we want to talk about ?
what information do they want to give us , the members of this parliament ?
there is no question about the fact that the two go hand in hand .
what is that process to look like ?
what does this mean ?
question time ( commission )
that is the only response i can give you .
first part
thank you for your reply , commissioner .
what are your views on this ?
what specific measures need to be taken ?
it is , of course , only one of the organisations in the field .
what are we trying to do ?
thank you for your reply , commissioner .
i therefore hope that we shall discuss this again on the basis of the plan because you too have an important role to play .
what is the commission 's position ?
i believe that the commission has been very clear .
firstly , i believe that growth is important .
within growth , it is essential to increase employment .
i believe that this is the position of both the european union and the commission .
i would thank the commissioner for his answer .
it has a different scope .
what is the point in us having a government ?
do you think that the case of ireland is less serious because it is a country of less economic importance ?
what would happen if , instead of one country , there were two , three or four small countries ?
we believe that this is a positive step on the road to progress .
i hope that you would not want that !
you are absolutely right though .
i am concerned over the practice in some member states .
what is the commission 's view of this situation ?
how will the green paper deal with these issues ?
i would ask the commissioner whether she is prepared to give her support to this proposal .
in the interest of time we should start this debate .
as you see , there is still a great deal to be done .
i welcome the commissioner .
we believe that this principle should apply to all the eu 's fisheries agreements .
negotiations do not take place in a regional context .
for that reason , this time we will support the agreement .
commissioner , this is now the second major fisheries agreement between the european union and a third party .
having said that , this agreement should be based on economic criteria .
the commission therefore cannot accept this proposal either .
the debate is closed .
i am not talking only in terms of trade .
i would , however , like to look at the content of this initiative .
however , for the least developed countries , market access is not sufficient .
the text of our resolution has the feel of a compromise .
in his reply , let me ask the commissioner to address some important questions .
thank you for your attention .
the debate is closed .
we believe , as a parliament - and we have said this many times in the past - that this is essential for both environmental and safety reasons .
we are pleased that the council has made a political commitment to this effect .
i say that to colleagues from all political parties , from all member states .
i think we need to go into this further in order to reach an agreement as quickly as possible .
all we need for proper regulation is the council .
we must be able to find a solution here .
it is all about the procedure at the moment .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we welcome the council 's decision to include in the common position the essential points of the amendments adopted by this house .
today , unfortunately , we are not much further on .
i therefore welcome the proposals relating to this .
that is good .
other efforts are required , too .
however , rules alone are not enough .
the proposal tabled by the commission is crucial and an important step in the right direction .
let us move on to the proposals .
the problem is where .
we cannot , however , accept amendment no 1 .
having said that , we must try to move the proposal forward as soon as possible .
the joint debate is closed .
this last aspect , in particular , is the subject of debate in this report .
mr president , commissioner , rapporteur , thank you so much for all your efforts .
it was a joint effort .
mr president , first of all i should like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done .
the debate is closed .
madam president , on a point of order .
believe me , i will look into this matter .
first a positive point .
but now a second matter , madam president .
i find this unacceptable .
welcome
the economic situation is also difficult .
therefore the peace process must continue .
violence must stop .
this point has already been made in the commission 's communication in 1998 on the same issue .
the position is absolutely clear .
that , however , is not the case .
and so the list goes on .
( applause from the left )
let me make the position of my group on this matter quite clear .
not in the view of my group .
what , then , is our policy ?
i feel that parliament 's role is coming into its own in this case as well .
i believe that both parties will have to make great efforts to achieve this .
we should take a more objective view .
so what can we do ?
peace will not come from resolutions adopted here - although we can help .
madam president , i would like to thank you all for an excellent debate .
so what can the eu do further ?
it is of major international interest .
it is crucial to the future of us all and therefore we demand that the parties also take their responsibility .
a great deal has happened since then .
that is , i think , what the minister was saying and he has our total support .
the debate is closed .
we will never get the countries of the third world and developing countries to take action if no joint responsibility is taken by the eu and the us .
my point here is different .
i hope that will not happen .
when the united states and the european union work together , we set the international agenda .
it is important for the european union and for the united states and indeed for the world . of course , we will not always agree on everything .
so where are we today ?
that is not what it is .
we need to do a lot more work on that .
i would finally like to say a few words about security policy .
i think not .
he is absolutely right .
but we need more than words .
but we must get down to work together .
my final point concerns parliamentary relations .
mr president , i will focus on the single area of environmental issues .
that must be our position .
we must fight together for greater environmental protection and greater safety .
i wish parliament success in this area .
the debate is closed .
vote
( parliament approved the proposal )
( parliament approved the proposal )
so these amendments are not acceptable to the commission .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
president .
after the vote :
the voting , however , will continue .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we have expressed our views on this before .
this is why the european union must set an example .
but not people .
obviously , we voted against this motion for a resolution .
" what about ?
" i asked him .
"
these proposals go in the right direction .
however , that is not the case .
we cannot compromise on safety .
we welcome the proposals on which parliament voted today and which go in the right direction .
president .
at last , i understand what is going on !
now i understand !
madam president , this was an extremely important report .
we have to address this issue .
there is something seriously wrong here .
it is completely unacceptable .
we need to address this .
who would not do so ?
therefore , we are voting against this proposal .
i also hope that this will not happen .
i therefore voted for the motion .
we have also voted against parliament 's report .
instead , the opportunity should be taken to reform the organisation of the market .
why did i vote against the motion , mr president ?
turkey has been going through difficult times since the beginning of this year .
we all know that .
that is the problem .
but we would all like to help put an end to this situation .
that is why we must speak out .
there they experience many difficulties .
in these circumstances it is , of course , very difficult to make people in turkey understand why we debate these problems here in the european parliament .
i shall say no more .
unfortunately no action has yet been taken .
and rightly so .
this needs to be taken more seriously , not the political aspects but what can be done here .
there is , however , one problem .
i believe that the european parliament , the council and the commission must continue their joint efforts .
on behalf of the council , i would like to thank you for this work .
the debate is closed .
we also believe that there is a vital role for parliament and its party groups .
the european union shall continue to express its solidarity with this country and its confidence in its people .
they themselves are responsible for the future of their country .
that is why we now need to look at the situation outside the country .
elections were held in kosovo last year .
it is just not on .
we must just hope that the elections can still be brought forward .
so i think we are on the right course here .
so what is to be done ?
i think this is the right step to take .
i think that the region as a whole needs to be able to feel at home in europe .
secondly , we as the european union can do something ourselves .
the debate is closed .
it has been discussed .
the legal basis is such that we can take the article which the commission used as a basis .
whether we want to or not is a political decision .
the committee decided by a large majority that it would take this article as a basis .
mr president , i simply wish to make a point of order .
that is also in the interest of european citizens .
we do not wish to do this .
we must discuss this matter again as soon as possible and then adopt a motion .
that is my first point .
i should like to say three things .
that is a problem .
that is , i believe , unacceptable .
with regard to the amendments which are now under consideration , the commission can accept six of them in full or in part .
the following amendments cannot be accepted .
i cannot accept at this stage an increase in the budget .
it is very difficult to change it .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is not how things stand , however .
for us a number of principles are essential in this .
i should like to mention four .
mr president , i think there are many good points in the commission 's report , and i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a job well done .
much has been said about solidarity and security .
what will happen to security ?
mr president , this is a very good report .
that is why both the member states and the european union need to act here .
i should also like to mention the contribution by the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities to the report .
this reform is social and economic in nature .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
my second question concerns the future .
can we be absolutely sure about what will happen in the future ?
the council has not discussed the particular matter brought up in the question .
i cannot therefore comment on this .
what stage has been reached in the further consideration of this document in the council ?
let me start by saying that i entirely agree with the honourable member on the importance of the legal instrument in question .
thank you for your answer .
this is not new .
in other words , when can i get my first document out of the council ?
what does the president-in-office have to say about all this ?
this is also a question of the security of the european institutions .
you have the floor .
such monitoring is taking place .
thank you for that very full reply , mr president-in-office .
thank you , mr president-in-office .
thank you for your answer .
the matter is clear .
i hope that it is on its way .
much has been achieved .
there are many other groups which also need to be mentioned .
let us therefore work together in order to achieve this .
the amendments tabled and approved are a step in this direction .
my question is this : what is the commission going to do ?
the same applies to market balance .
the area which we are discussing is not important just for the regions ; it is also a very important area for the european budget .
i should like to comment on all four .
this is certainly a good idea .
thank you very much , commissioner for this very full answer .
the debate is closed .
that is a reality .
that is what it is all about .
so support in principle is there .
which is unacceptable .
that cannot be .
in this respect , we have to know what the common foreign and security policy should look like in the future and who is to be responsible for it .
europe 's share of the common foreign and security policy is still very small .
that cannot be .
they are also questions of transparency and control of the common foreign and security policy and of defence policy .
here too we are of one opinion .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i just want to list a few points which will be important to us .
that would be too little for me from a foreign policy point of view .
what will happen then ?
we shall see .
i thank the rapporteur and the commissioner .
that is our job as representatives of the people .
we must be clear about that .
that would take us one stage further .
madam president , i also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work ; i support most of what she has said , especially on reform .
it is important that we review these issues , but not at this stage .
the debate is closed .
i want your country to know that it has the support of the european parliament .
mr president , i shall now ask you to address our parliament .
( applause )
our common europe .
"
the year 2000 was the year of the " economy " .
this year , 2001 , is the year of " legislation " .
but the process must continue and the system must remain open .
thank you once again .
are there any comments ?
that is one thing .
everyone is well aware of that .
we hope we will be successful as soon as possible .
what is important is that we improve security .
( applause )
we will see if that is possible tomorrow morning .
he obviously never wanted anything like this to happen .
what did happen was that three people
it cannot therefore be put back on parliament 's agenda .
i would like to make something clear .
that is what it says .
that was not the case .
are there any other comments ?
we will make that change to the minutes .
we will look into all that , of course .
( parliament approved the minutes )

this work cannot be done by a national party .
up until now the european parties have been supported by their groups in the european parliament .
this goes further than existing national legislation on parties .
thanks are also due here to the committee on budgets and the committee on legal affairs and the internal market for their good proposals .
i should like to address one more point : the council was present yesterday , and i received the speech of the president-in-office on behalf of the council presidency .
i should very much like to hand it over to the president of parliament .
how then is the will of the european people to be expressed , if not through parties ?
( applause )
they are the political parties .
this is an open debate .
there was no other way until now .
we must never end up in a situation of that kind .
we need stability in our democracy with a view to enlargement .
only in that way can we in this parliament help democracy develop in the future .
that is of key importance .
furthermore , we need stability with a view to democratic development in the european union .
in addition , it is necessary for those parties to be independent .
there is more to say on this subject .
we very much share the view , of course , that this cannot mean support for national parties .
i do not think that this is the case .
we are not against europe .
however , what are political parties ?
because those of us who believe in a political europe , and in my group we do , of course , believe in this , know that the parties are a fundamental part of a political union .
all have national parties .
it does not really ensure transparency .
to all those who are now talking about parties i do have to say that each of us is sitting here because he was the candidate of a political party at national level .
parties are not an end in themselves .
state funding of european political parties is quite different , therefore , to state funding of political groups within the european parliament .
"
i wish to comment on the most important amendments before the house .
the right rules need to be found for this .
it is in the interests of democracy and in the interests of democracy in the community .
thank you for the very full information you have been kind enough to give us , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we shall bring about practical results .
what protection will be provided for this information ?
who can access and use it ?
i would congratulate the rapporteur .
secondly , we are taking one more step towards the creation of the area of freedom , security and justice .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place in a moment .
thank you very much madam president .

( parliament adopted the resolution )
thank you very much , madam president .
i am the president of the european parliament .
it is essential that we are given this opportunity .
' how are you ?
' why ?
' how much is it ?
in my opinion , it would be appropriate if the european political parties took part in national elections , rather than having national political parties take part in european elections .
as long as we have national parties , we will never have a europe .
the same applies to european parties .
the first reason concerns the content of the report .
court of justice case law on this point is as clear as day .
next , democracy means transparency .
the member states have not been anything like good enough at doing the monitoring .
is this progress in common security ?
we have more than enough to deal with .
we therefore cannot vote for the report .
we therefore see no reason why we should go along with the proposed change of strategy .
the fact of the matter is simply this .
so there you have it !
we are positive that all the workers of europe will say the same and we shall be at their side .
the joint debate is closed .
it is extremely difficult .
they will never be successful .
that is , of course , not difficult to answer .
as you know , the commission is not a member of the council of europe .
he is only human , and we must accept that !
we obviously need more practice !
human rights
however , that is not enough , of course .
we welcome this , and will give our full cooperation .
should we not also consider whether this is an area where we can make a contribution ?
i think this applies to russia as much as the eu member states .
that is when freedom is at risk .
the debate is the result of an initiative for a resolution taken by the group of the european people 's party .
i do not even want to waste words on this .
i just want to see the result of all this .
we only believe in positive values .
where this will end in russia , we do not yet know , but it is clear that that country 's democracy is in crisis .
it seems to me to be a good idea for the european parliament to look into this issue and to see what it can do about it , for it concerns us all .
support under the european initiative should continue .
the debate is closed .
that is not done , however .
children have human rights , which are fundamental agreements .
what is the point ?
( applause from the left )
the debate is closed .
that is the purpose of my amendment .
i refer here to measures within the framework of regional policy , agricultural policy , rural development policy and state aid policy .
the debate is closed .
a common area of justice will only make sense if , within it , the court decisions of one member state are effective in all the other member states .
as a result , it is again your turn to speak .
we talk a great deal about a european community of values .
of course we know that there are considerable problems today .
i think that we have before us an important report .
this is often not the case .
i think that the europe of the future is also a europe of the workers .
only in the case of workers ' rights does this still not happen in europe .
for which i also thank you .
i should like to comment on the specific questions asked .
"
"
can we believe a word it says ?
the debate is closed .
vote
the next item is the vote
mr president , on a point of order .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
' great !
something which may be against the law in one member state , is not in another .
statement by the president
agenda
the next item is the order of business .
it has never been discussed in this parliament .
it is a fundamental rights issue .
madam president , i should like to address the same issue .
it can be taken at any time , however , and no further meeting is required for the purpose .
the specific programmes are the instruments for implementation .
madam president , i think that it is true to say that this is the first time that the commission has presented its proposals for specific programmes so quickly after having presented the proposal for a framework programme .
madam president , i should also like to congratulate the commissioner and the commission on this proposal .
what are the reasons ?
we must not , therefore , expect the framework programme to fund all european research .
i do believe that this issue concerning the number of specific programmes should not prevent a dialogue on the content of the priorities .
that was not my question , however .
i hope that this will now change .
let us discuss this .
this is an important subject , which we discuss a great deal , but it is an area in which still too little is done .
madam president , i hope you will not rule me out of order , but i have a very specific question to the commissioner on research .
european research is therefore absolutely urgent .
my second question concerns the instruments .
this is quite clear and that is why we need new instruments .
i hope that our proposal will be adopted .
i believe , therefore , that this could be done .
problems relating to research , since i am speaking about research .
with regard to the resources that the european union is making available for research , i think that i tell everyone that it is essential that we make a greater overall effort .
they must step up their efforts .
i fully understand this question .
i believe that this is the type of discussion that we are going to have .
first of all , let me take the content of the priorities .
these aspects must always be taken into consideration .
we will try to answer it point by point .
i have already mentioned this .
i would like to say once again that the european research area is not simply the european framework programme .
the european framework programme is an aspect of the european research area .
we must , therefore , play a part in this .
that is our aim .
madam president , i should like to thank the commissioner , for i think that this is one of the most important areas of all that we are discussing here today .
this is absolutely clear .
this is one of the fundamental criteria .
i would also like to thank all the members who have taken part in the debate .
the debate is closed .
it might help us .
amsterdam is one more step in that direction .
why do i say this ?
we want a convention .
madam president-in-office of the council , i shall now give you the floor .
, council .
europe must mean more than a market .
i think this is a good thing .
we must make this european union democratic .
( applause )
( applause )
we therefore have a joint responsibility .
i naturally welcome the fact that the president-in-office is present here today .
i would like to address the president-in-office of the council because she has said some important things .
in this respect , i believe that we have to be clear : it is not only a request of the european parliament at this point .
we , the eu , could not act .
i want to take up a few points here that i consider important .
what kind of talk is that ?
what kind of view of democracy is that ?
i think that then we would all stand to benefit .
of course it does .
we cannot really see the point of having a convention in order to draw up the next treaty amendment .
but no !
where is the real cohesion ?
we do not want to see a united states of europe , but a community .
nothing more and nothing less .
that is not our view .
mr president , madam president-in-office of the council , it would be better if you were to adopt this idea .
perhaps it will be a convention after all .
so what will it be ?
it is not a good solution !
we expect their support on these two matters .
i would call that into question .
more important , however , is the eu 's future stability .
that is why i shall be voting against it .
we do not need any new institutions .
i look forward to the debate at that time .
all right , perhaps that is the case , but democracy is a human creation after all , and only a human creation .
one thing is quite clear , however .
finally i would like to thank you for today 's debate .
i am sure we will find that tomorrow in the vote .
this is a cause for concern .
we therefore need the europe of citizens and not just a europe of governments !
power on the one hand , democracy on the other .
mr president .
it is a difficult treaty that is difficult to understand .
this is something that we must change .
let us not do this again .
after all , it does not mean that we must not carry on national debate with organisations and others .
we must not make the institutional debate the main issue ; we must start from the objective questions : what do we actually want to do with the eu ?
how is this to be done ?
we must start with the objective debate .
the answer is clearly no !
this was also its main task .
the debate that we are having today and the report that we are discussing is a first step in that process .
that is being left to the member states whose responsibility it is .
more than anything , i want more democracy .
it is based on common principles and there is in principle majority voting .
so now we have time to start a real public debate .
what is our common objective ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we welcome the further aid that is going to given in the form of food aid .
thank you for this additional response .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
environmental policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we can control it ,
no , it is not .
we also have a responsibility in international trade relations .
this is therefore the vital task for us .
so what do these young people have ?
what do they lack ?
many things have been considered .
however , that is often a problem .
these are a few of the things we want to think about .
we need the means to do so , however .
mr president , i would like to say a few words about the commission 's proposal on sustainable development .
i think more could have been said about that .
sustainable development concerns all policy areas .
social policy is also naturally part of sustainable development .
good social policy and fair economic policy are vital .
the legislation must continue .
the legislation we have in the eu must be implemented better .
i think this is clear in the programme .
at the same time , we must also ensure that we implement this legislation .
i believe this can help to put pressure on countries .
this is naturally vital .
thank you for this debate .
let us ensure that we can put these issues into practice .
this is actually nothing new .
the debate is closed .
i wish them every success .
environmental issues must be included in all community policies and decisions .
i see this as particularly welcome .
firstly , it is necessary to apply the legislation .
the interest in this programme is clear .
the first is the application of community law .
this is unfortunately the only thing the governments understand .
we support the commission .
allow me to move on to the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
that is not the right way to go about things , of course .
i cannot therefore but support the honourable member .
what the rapporteur has made of it makes the matter even more difficult .
that is not industry , it is the consumer .
i am sure we could have included it .
only what the rapporteur has made of it does not improve matters .
there is nothing about that at all .
it would not have been given priority in the current policy .
two matters are of key importance to me .
my second point concerns international cooperation .
international agreements are important .
mr president , i would like to thank all the members who have taken part in the discussion .
thank you once again .
that is always the risk if you want to make a short .
i wanted to make it an action programme .
this is what we are working on at the moment .
that has been our objective all the time .
finally , we welcome this opinion .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this can be seen in the context of the debate held earlier today .
i hope it will at least be included some time in the future .
thank you all .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is not true !
so more can be done than proposed .
to that extent i find the compromise just about acceptable .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we proposed a great many amendments .
we think it is better to keep it in the financial regulation as a legislative instrument .
what would you do ?
however , we shall see tomorrow morning .
for the budgetary control committee , the reform of financial control is the key aspect of this proposal .
"
there has been too little action in the past .
there are many practical problems which we have to look at in the external budget .
i want our development assistance programme to be the best in the world .
we have a long way to go before we achieve that .
that is why i too agree that parliament should only vote on the amendments tomorrow .
this can only be achieved once both administrative and financial responsibility are clearly united under the same people as is now being done .
this would also increase their own responsibility for their work .
however , change is absolutely essential .
in principle we support the proposals of the rapporteur .
mr president , the present financial regulation is out of date .
that is the only way we shall get the citizens to accept it !
today we have the opportunity to debate parliament 's amendments and reports .
i should like to begin by going over a few basic principles once again .
do you wish to be heard ?
you have the floor .
thank you .
at this stage of the debate it can only be on a point of order .
as for the council , i would like to thank it .
the debate is closed .
this is an important issue .
i think it is very important .
this is particularly the case regarding children .
there is therefore a need for such a system .
it is important for them to have common safety requirements so that the regulations are clear .
all these are good proposals .
however , we propose six amendments .
i look forward to our being able to reach a common decision in the eu and to our being able to implement this vital measure which is fundamental to road safety in the eu .
ladies and gentlemen , i will now refer to specific amendments .
parliament thanks the commission .
the debate is closed .
we would like to put a stop to this once and for all .
victims feel they are alone .
working life is part of life , not all of it .
they are still few in number .
i think that this too will encourage debate about this particular issue in germany .
i think this is excellent .
the legislation would provide protection for them .
why are they important ?
why is this directive so important ?
in this respect , a great deal has been achieved in the member states of the european union over the years .
i should therefore like to know from her what she can and is prepared to do about this .
the proposed reform does not go far enough .
women must have equal pay for work of equal value !
secondly , positive action .
that also remains a very difficult matter , even with women .
take the example of equal pay .
we have taken into account the new treaty and the new legal basis and , of course , we have taken into account the case law of the court of justice .
but as i have already said , we are going to propose measures in 2002 .
we are going to issue a communication and support and encourage member states to take this into account .
finally , as you can see , the commission can accept most of parliament 's amendments .
i would like to congratulate you .
i would like to thank you for your cooperation so that we can have this directive in place as soon as possible .
the debate is closed .
i cannot support this approach . what is important is not the number of demands we put forward in a specific case but their practical implementation .
i also think it is important that there is better coordination with other community initiatives .
i should like to ask you again to give this serious consideration .
i would like to add two comments .
i hope that it will never be possible to implement any such measure at european level .
the term of the budget is also a discussion point .
however , there is clearly more to it than that .
the debate is closed .

so vote for it !
' ' really ?
' how have you come to understand that ?
do not you see ?
at home they say one thing and out here they do something very different .
if we want a europe we should also have european parties .
we are not even discussing it .
this is why i have voted against .
this is now also the common view of parliament as a whole .
there is no single european people , but a great many .
there is no single european culture , but a great many .
as a group , we cannot accept any of them .
one of our priorities must continue to be making the public at large more aware .
i voted against .
the report that we are voting on today will cause difficulties .
this applies in the case of environmental responsibility .
i do not think so .
i certainly would not !

there was some discussion on the question to what extent this regulation is a community power or a power of the member states .
mr president , i voted for this report .
i hope not !
why , you may ask .
this is why we have voted in favour of the report .
is that what we want ?
naturally , i voted for the motion .
it is much better to bring work to people that to take people to work .
are there any comments ?
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i have a comment about the minutes .
( the minutes were approved )
agenda
this is completely possible .
we have the whole morning for these two discussions .
madam president , thank you very much .
i would like to know why this is the case .
the order of business is thus established .
any future debate here should follow the debate in our own country .
i believe we are different .
we accept democracy nevertheless , because it is the only way .
i shall therefore give him the floor once again .
i shall , of course , take note of what you have said .
that was my question .
this is not the case at all .
this is clear .
i would like to bring up two points .
i would like the european parliament to adopt this position .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
with the support of the european parliament , all these points should be included in the draft before us .
both are on the increase .
we believe that various measures are necessary for this purpose .
what i do welcome in the council 's report is the commitment towards the member states .
and where is development cooperation in this respect ?
this is another important point .
that is why i believe that these reports are crucial .
does this proposal allow for sufficient cooperation ?
mr president , this is a very important report and a significant step forward .
finally , i fully support the compromise agreement reached by our committee on article 5 ( 4 ) .
we should never have let things get this far .
we shall support these two reports by voting in favour of the amendments that go further than the council proposal .
i should like to congratulate both our colleagues on their excellent reports .
i do not think we can believe that .
what measures ?
the european union and its member states must adopt a joint approach in cooperation with the third countries concerned .
the framework decision is an important step towards better cooperation between member states .
these problems must be considered in the accession negotiations with the central and east european countries .
i support the proposals put forward in the report .
that is true .
i think it is important to note one of the conference 's conclusions in particular .
here , it was clear that changes must take place .
for example , it is important that provisions that are adopted are also implemented in practice .
naturally , the presidency needs great support if such a resolution is to be decided on .
it is important to implement the common decisions that we have taken in each country .
this of course requires an opinion from the european parliament .
within the eu , we have decided that we must take animals ' needs into consideration .
naturally , we will continue to show consideration for animals because our legislation demands it .
in a little over a week there will be a further discussion in the agriculture council .
this house is , of course , very aware of these concerns .
i know where i stand on this : work with the farmers .
second , there is the need for further community actions .
in my view , the question is not so much ' why ' but - quite rightly - ' how ' .
this has been discussed for many years at european level , so it is not a new issue .
this is therefore progress .
now we have been given an answer from the commission to the question that i put .
i take them around .
i trade them here , i trade them there .
the food safety authority will need to address this matter .
it will certainly have our support .
i have asked you a question in this connection .
in my view , some progress has already been made in the past .
' , naturally he is going to say : ' of course i would !
this is a very important point .
mr president , i would ask to be allowed to comment on some of what has been said here in the debate .
i still think that we must ask both questions - not only why , but also how .
clearly there is an answer to these questions .
i share this opinion .
we have a special position in respect of animals and it is only we who can accept that responsibility .
he does not believe that people are prepared to pay .
finally , i would like to thank you very much for the fact that we were able to have this debate .
let me deal with a number of the individual issues that were raised by many of you .
first of all , there is the question of animal transport .
this is something that will be discussed , however , and considered in the context of the conference before the end of the year , together with other issues .
i fully agree .
that should not happen .
that is why a european strategy must be developed .
the public and private sectors are both crucial in this .
for the commission , this is a fundamental point .
the debate is closed .
we can , however , draw certain conclusions .
we also face other problems , however .
we need to start in europe , however .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i would like to say that i was here yesterday .
i would like to see these included .
we have taken note of that too .
mr president , i raised the matter of question time yesterday .
( parliament approved the minutes )
( parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
mr president , the commission and the council have asked for urgent procedure .
( parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
for that reason , the matter requires due political consideration .
european food authority
mr president , this is a moment of some importance for consumer protection in the european union .
you cannot have the one without the other .
everything has to be seen through this focus .
they are all there in due measure .
we go for transparency .
this is an idea which has not so much found its time as found us at precisely the right moment .
i hope the house will support it in the vote .
mr president , commissioner , the european food authority is of fundamental importance to the people in our community .
and the authority is to present a draft budget each year .
with regard to risk assessment , it should be of a scientific and independent nature .
he has done a great job .
however , i would still like to focus attention on one particular point .
i also hope that this legislative proposal is quickly adopted and implemented .
mr president , there are two key reasons for action in this field .
food is a single market and food safety is a public health issue .
keep the number to 12 .
it is now necessary for cooperation between these two authorities to be developed .
instead we must develop it further and improve the system even more in the future .
first of all , there is safety .
secondly , quality .
the commission proposals concerning the development of food legislation and food safety are positive .
i agree with the proposal by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy that risk assessment is a task for the food authority .
i would call for further development in the future .
mr president , our rapporteur has done an excellent job and i should like to congratulate him on behalf of my group .
however , i do have a few comments to make .
these matters are important to citizens .
it is all about balance .
i hope that this project will be a success .
last but not least , we are discussing the powers of this new authority .
these must be one of its main political and legislative priorities .
it is proposed out of principle .
at this time , we are not in a position to accept the proposed amendment to include the word ' safety ' .
this is an issue that i regard as being particularly important .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
implementation in particular will be difficult .
i would ask you to think this through .
this regulation is of crucial importance .
the proposal will achieve this objective .
one way or the other , we cannot expect the house to make do with the present system .
the joint debate is closed .
i can understand that .
problems remain .
my group is able to support all the amendments .
the rules of procedure state that the committee on economic and monetary affairs is responsible for competition matters .
vote
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before the vote : president .
and not only did it exist , but it had also already adopted the majority of what we were discussing .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
yet when all is said and done , perhaps that is what they really want .
i voted in favour of this report .
however , certain circumstances may lead us to consider whether we need to create a special authority , and this is the case here .
that part of their objectives will not receive my support .
thank you for your answer .
' so you were a member of the european parliament ?
in fact i have voted in favour .
with these words i wish to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work which we will vote for in every respect .
in such conditions , what can we do ?
therefore , those amendments could only be accepted in principle .
there are four amendments on other issues .
i consider it essential to put this legislation in place soon , so that appropriate monitoring can start .
the debate is closed .
why is this so important ?
what you have seen this time will be seen more often in the future .
the european parliament is responsible for monitoring the common trade policy .
but on important international trade issues , the union is not such a model of democratic transparency .
let us return to the discussion then .
that is the first point .
i know nothing about any other meeting .
the debate is closed .
allow me to make one additional comment .
we have not reached that stage yet .
but that is another matter .
this is an important point , in our view .
that is not the point .
as i am sure the house will understand , this is a subject on which i have certain views myself .
the commission does not share this view and nor do other european partners .
the debate is closed .
development of the external service
i therefore take a positive view of this communication from the commission .
i believe that it takes us in the right direction , but it clearly does not fully deal with the issue .
when i say ' we ' , i mean , of course , the committee on budgets .
firstly , there is the need to move quickly .
the second point that i should like to mention quickly is the budgetary aspect .
mr president , first of all , i want to thank the rapporteur .
in the future , the work is therefore to be done out in the field .
if there is no money then say : we need the money .
we therefore support his proposals for a resolution and we hope that the commission and the council will consider them .
the necessary coordination does not exist within the european union .
finally , let me comment on the proposed action plan .
we take the reform and development of the external service very seriously .
then all of us together have to share in taking the political responsibility for those decisions .
the debate is closed .
i have a few questions .
i also have a question about the longer term .
this was already included in the previous proposal .
has the commission already considered this ?
can you say anything more about this ?
why is it not a longer list ?
we are making quite good progress here .
thank you commissioner .
question time ( council )
if not , why not ?
however , once again i would point out that it is the commission 's responsibility to deal with these issues .
we all know that it is a very necessary organisation .
the european union makes greater demands than that .
the council is already monitoring these issues .
therefore , i believe there is reason to return to this .
that is what i call a short answer .
the european council in itself is a council issue .
can we have any information on this matter ?
what are you going to do ?
if the commission were to put forward such a proposal for consideration by the council , which has not yet happened , the council would be prepared to act quickly .
during the review which can now be carried out , the council will give due attention to the recent events which the honourable member has brought up .
i believe that the compromise reached yesterday was quite difficult to achieve .
as they deal with the same subject , questions nos 11 and 12 shall be taken together .
nor has the commission put forward any proposal or other initiative on this matter for the council to address .
thank you for your answer .
there is no doubt that if the european union decided to take this step , the impact would be considerable .
as i said , there has been no proposal in the council to take up this issue .
i thank the council for its reply .
thank you very much for your reply .
i would like you to tell parliament about the political measures , not so much of the united nations , but of the european union .
mr president-in-office of the council , what could be done ?
therefore , i believe that we must focus our initiatives on this particular approach .
the presidency has not yet received any such request .
therefore , i cannot answer the question on behalf of the council .
i would like a response on that .
i am not in a position to make any clear statement on cause and effect .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
why do i say this ?
my group will support it .
but such a date could only be decided once the council has reached agreement on the content of the proposal .
in conclusion , parliament 's support for this proposal is important in order to achieve a good result .
i thank parliament and the rapporteur very much indeed .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we have , however , to live in the real world and therefore we must take those decisions .
it does need to be seen in that context .
this is a very important step in the reform of the commission and i am pleased to give it , on behalf of my group , our full support .
there are three reasons for that .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we did not vote on any of them , they were accepted by us in our report .
indeed , the final text before us has been the result of a lot of work by many people .
i should like to say a few things about the text itself .
we have seen it happen .
we already have competition .
the amendments voted in committee are a step in this direction .
it has , for me and for my colleagues , a value and an objective in itself , which is one of the conditions of social cohesion , which provided the basis of our europe .
balance in this report is important .
much has already been said about the content of the directive and i only wish to focus on what i feel to be the essential points .
i believe that this is an information measure which will also promote our internal market .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
all this was achieved by the free opportunity that all citizens have across europe to bring to their concerns before this european parliament .
it is a matter which we must take measures against in some other way .
the debate is closed .
they were all very pleased with the progress achieved during the negotiations .
( applause )
however , the enlargement process must not be held up .
that is not the point .
( applause )
firstly , sustainable development .
ladies and gentlemen , the need for public support is clear .
together , we can do more and do it better .
but this is not all .
( applause )
some people want to keep everything they had in the past .
( applause )
then we shall see what needs to be done .
( applause )
we have come a long way together .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
therefore , on behalf of my group , i have asked the president of the commission for a commission statement on economic and social cohesion and enlargement .
secondly , i will refer to the conclusions which you have presented to the council .
that is how things are done .
that is a serious issue .
this means that candidate countries too must be able to be fully included in this process .
the same applies in other areas , especially the economic and social area .
first , in my view , we must respect the rules of democracy .
i would also , madam president , like to talk about transparency .
what should it decide ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am concerned about the result in ireland .
there is another summit being held .
all this is required for sustainable development .
they must have an impact on transport policy , energy policy and agricultural policy as we develop a society sustainable in the long term .
i believe that it was good to be so clear on the issue of a convention .
should those in power in europe , including myself , not " put their own house in order " first ?
should we not first , or perhaps at the same time , do something about this ?
there must be a good result .
it is a case of the eu having to follow its own rules .
as such , it was also a vote for a better and more democratic europe .
ireland 's no was not , however , a no to eu enlargement .
it would be a serious matter if this were to happen .
the answer is " no " .
we must respect that decision .
i did not know how that decision was made .
thank you ireland .
let us just think about what we have in common and what we want to achieve together .
thank you .
if that has not happened before 2002 , then we have a serious problem .
that is not acceptable .
that is not so .
the european union must do everything it can , madam president-in-office , to put an end to this terrorism and help this country .
i feel that the european union will be able to play a major role in this matter .
many people have also mentioned sustainable development and the environmental issues .
we have seen the way the eu can play an important role .
naturally , this work must continue .
( applause )
this is what we have done thus far and this is what we will do in the future .
we were quite clear about this from the very first time the matter was raised and we must continue to be so now .
the debate is closed .
vote
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
procedure without debate
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
it really does not need to be put to the vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
madam president , i do not like the result of this vote .
we cannot , however , take a decision of this kind on one word in a text .
before the vote
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
welcome
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
but you say that this paragraph was adopted .
madam president , i voted against this resolution .
in general i feel this resolution points in the wrong direction .
i voted " against " .
i very much hope that this summit also makes strong progress on the issue of the environment .
for it is young people who are the main victims .
that , at least , is what we hope and what we wanted to express through our vote .
because , if not , something needs to change .
i cannot stress this enough and i would like to say that we voted for the text .
make way for the young people of those countries !
you do not use them , do you ?
" " what are you saying ?
i have voted against the proposal .
the answer to that , of course , is that it must be .
therefore , that is also an important point .
mr president , we support this directive .
why ?
secondly , competition .
that does not mean it is not still open to discussion .
of course they are .
let us be serious .
it is in the interest of the internal market that a european framework be created for that purpose .
that was mentioned a moment ago .
that would not be the first one .
our group has tabled two amendments .
i am sure that is true .
we shall not be alone .
i cannot believe that they will agree to this .
this is not something we should agree with .
the area of application of the directive is the most essential question in this whole matter .
i believe it is important that a common position has been reached .
" he was quite right .
that said , let us get to the point .
why ?
you have no right to reply .
it is a compromise which i have accepted , although i do not like it , and i would like to make this very clear .
many thanks , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we must therefore do something about this .
the proposal will now be presented to the council .
so , does the european parliament really want this fund ?
so we have tabled the relevant proposed amendments .
we think this is the right way forward .
that is something that we can address at second reading .
it is not enough to agree on a set of rules .
back to today .
what solution do the three reports before us today propose ?
we would therefore support the commission 's proposal .
we want action and we want it now .
that is not the case , but with time and experience , that is what it could turn into .
mr president , let us make the most of a good thing .
of course , nothing of the kind has been proposed .
we also have an open mind about international regulations .
what is going to be done about this ?
no one could say !
that alone was cause for concern .
the present member states can do a great deal to help here .
we could apply this model here too .
we are not prepared to accept this .
the debate is closed .
that is why i welcome this european commission proposal .
my third point referred to article 4 .
question time ( commission )
part one
we very much want to support them and be by their side .
there are a number of points we consider important .
the commission does not have access to additional resources .
we have a specific budget .
this is crucial .
today this is something which we more or less agree upon .
this fund , however , will not be a un organisation .
they have been working on this for a year without much progress .
it is true that these organisations need money .
we will come to this in the next question .
these are the questions that we need to come back to .
this is the real issue .
this was the main contribution of our action programme .
i asked you : what amount are you going to provide ?
that is a fact .
we will continue to work towards this in parliament .
but my question has a different aim .
i see .
i think this needs to be the general model for the future .
thank you for your response , commissioner .
i hope so too .
question time is closed .
it is by no means always serious , but still .
we are therefore pleased with the support which our amendments received in the committee .
it is also important for us to stress best practice , particularly in the area of research and development .
the debate is closed .
a third point is training .
let us now see , however , how the member states set about the task .
this might be at a national or local level .
this directive has finally provided a solution .
it is a first .
it is true for various reasons .
i have seen it .
i thank all the people who have been a part of that .
the debate is closed .
could we perhaps waste a little time ?
in other words , we have to deal with a real situation here , which we cannot allow to put us under pressure .
but more can still be done .
in this context i would like to mention cooperation with russia .
what is even more important is the transport sector .
the report makes very welcome proposals here .
that is why price management must not be the main issue of the dialogue .
i support that paragraph .
there is no such thing .
what next ?
and this is the subject of this report .
without transparency there can be no democracy , not even in europe .
that is also , of course , what the commission has proposed .
it is up to farmers to follow the legislation through .
one of them was transport of animals .
i know it is very difficult for people to understand this , but i hope that the commissioner will follow it through and keep that legislation in place .
but at the same time , i am of the opinion that the council should also be here today .
i wanted to make this quite clear .
but it is and remains just a compromise .
but i think this is the most practical solution .
now we have a proper proposal and , once again , parliament has done a good job .
that is the fact of the matter .
i would like , first , to thank parliament for the priority given to this issue .
it is for this reason that amendment no 11 cannot be accepted .
these amendments cannot be accepted .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
)
that is why we look on this assistance as an offer to the people there .
we need and we want to give money and we want to give it quickly .
will the commission address this and , if so , when , so that some form of solution can be found to this question , which is fundamental to the development of kosovo ?
with regard to the amendments that have been put forward , i would like to make a few comments that could help the debate .
nor do we consider amendment no 10 to be necessary , because it states that the aid must clearly focus on the budget .
i would like to comment on each of them .
obviously we are prepared to provide all the necessary information .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
we are not doing this at the moment .
i think it is not a parliament decision but a commission decision .
mr president , on a point of order .
it is really for them to look after members ' interests .
i think he has the matter well in hand .
we will deal with the matter .
structural measures
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i tabled one in particular , which was adopted by the committee on fisheries .
in my view , this amendment to the report is essential .
this issue was raised at the meeting of the committee on fisheries .
if it is possible , we must do so , and if we do , we will have voted in favour of a very good cause .
i have a few comments , however , to make with regard to some of the points .
the first two proposed amendments concern the legal basis .
i can accept the third proposed amendment .
these problems were raised during the debate .
thank you .
i entirely agree .
something needs to be done about it .
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution ) president .
'
i voted against all the amendments .
in view of this progress , we have voted in favour of this report .
2 .
3 .
4 .
this is not one such area .
however , that is not the case .
we cannot compromise on safety .
what we need now is for these measures to be implemented .
a thank you to the commission for having made this proposal and to us members for having approved it !
we are in favour of aid , but under different conditions .
i hope the commission will accept the changes proposed by parliament .
i therefore voted for the report .
we have therefore voted against this report .
this is fundamental .
the commission did not accept it at first , but then agreed to move in that direction .
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur .
in this sense this move is a very fundamental one .
i see this as a very important point .
the level can be discussed but the principle especially on this matter is very important .
in any case , i support the report presented by parliament .
now to the individual proposed amendments .
the debate is closed .
the joint debate is closed .
i believe we can all agree about that here in parliament .
there is more to it than that , however .
the joint debate is closed .
human rights
i am quite sure that we in the european union can do this .
at the same time the international companies involved must take their share of the responsibility .
we simply cannot take this .
unfortunately there is still no internal stability .
that is what is important .
i should like to see the commission also take action in this matter .
that is one of the this case .
it is based on respect for the law .
the current situation is difficult .
what are we to do ?
we need to review it again .
they , too , need our support .
these are some of the measures that are needed .
it will be essential to address these issues in order to ensure sustainable peace in the country .
the joint debate is closed .
the joint debate is closed .
they know more and better than we do .
there is no military solution to this conflict .
this is the pressure that we must support , both the european union as a whole and this part of it which is the european parliament .
the debate is closed .
i do not think either side will agree to this .
now third countries must return the favour .
that is a problem .
there has to be a better way .
i do not believe we have .
thank you , honourable members .
i will begin with the amendments the commission cannot accept .
i share the concern of the parliament .
as i have already said , the commission and parliament agree on this important issue .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
he had our full support .
that is my main concern .
nevertheless i support the report .
unfortunately , i cannot agree to amendment no 5 .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
vote
we can therefore no longer do anything to change it .
in any case , we are not going to start voting on the joint resolution .
we will see if the house will accept the technical amendment tabled by the honourable member .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
you speak a little too much , however .
just for today !
agenda
( the order of business was adopted )
as you know , we are doing all we can to improve the situation .
i should like to draw your attention to this .
madam president , on a point of order .
that is what parliament should be doing .
i call upon you to make every effort to bring this about .
i do not think so .
then there is implementation .
the debate is closed .
those are only some of the proposals .
the commission should therefore set to work .
that is important .
the point is that the issues raised here are a matter for national private civil law .
this must stop .
the legislation was adopted last year .
the debate is closed .
for this reason consumer protection matters at least as much .
mr president , i should like to hear what the commissioner has to say about the amendments .
mr president , these are amendments to the excellent text that has been put forward by the rapporteur .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
in conclusion , the commission would like once more to thank parliament for this resolution .
thank you very much , mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
there are , therefore , two problems .
why not consider direct aid ?
mr president , a number of members have raised the question why the commission has not brought forward some proposals concerning the report .
thank you very much , commissioner .
i am left with a few questions .
i welcome this .
does the european union have a say in this ?
how do we go about this ?
what will be the role of the local authorities ?
as you can see , i have quite a few questions .
you have said very little on this matter .
i wish the commissioner great success in the negotiations .
we need to know what you are doing about it .
we need to know that is being done and we need to hear from you that it is being done .
we expect you do it .
they do not .
we must see the beginning of change .
obviously , that is something on which the member states can act .
each country has its own rules and i am not going to tell the countries what they have to do on this issue .
that is the current situation .
there are two different aspects to this .
that is why i said before that we have already achieved positive results .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
these were enlargement of the union and issues relating to employment and the environment .
in addition , we wanted to develop the union 's common foreign and security policy .
this does not , of course , mean that the enlargement process has been carried out , but an important step has been taken .
instead , we adopted the strategy of taking action .
we have also said that russia is not enough .
that is important .
in this way , a list can be made of foreign policy activities .
the european union , too , might be able to play a role there in the right circumstances .
we have a direction in which to move , and the first necessary political decisions have been taken .
this is an excellent example of how parliament , together with the council and also the commission , can implement a change .
how is this to happen ?
what is that development to look like ?
that is something we now know following this presidency .
consideration must be given to the social price which people in the candidate countries will have to pay .
that applies to all the institutions of the european union .
that is important progress .
secondly : public health .
the policy proposals presented by the commission in its communication are still relevant .
the european council takes note of this fact - with particular reference to agriculture and fisheries .
finally : europe also has an international responsibility for sustainable development .
that is what sustainable development is about .
i wish that for you and for all of us , because we are a community .
( applause )
i say that on behalf of all of us .
( applause )
however , i do not know how much energy was put into the issue of sustainable development .
in some areas , the presidency has had great success .
above all , some important progress has been made towards enlargement of the union .
in other countries , there are other issues which must be brought into focus .
i should like to say the same .
there has been a great deal of talk about enlargement .
a number of new objectives were set .
what is the problem today as far as these environmental issues are concerned ?
that , if anything , is a success .
i also want to say something about global responsibility .
should there be a convention ?
in that way , the institutional issues come last .
we must respect ireland , but we must also respect the other member states .
there are those who say that we should now call it a day .
they want to take part in a real public debate .
we need a new approach .
we must never allow anything like this to happen again .
the final balance is very positive .
first of all enlargement .
that is unacceptable .
not at all !
sustainable development is an important step in taking the environment into account in european policy .
i am pleased that the presidency has been a success and that these issues have been put on the agenda .
i share his view .
we are against violence .
foreign policy , environmental policy , enlargement of the eu that is as much of a debate about the future as you can have .
i myself do not share this view , but believe that the debate on the future must now address what we want to achieve .
that is more or less where i stand .
the debate is closed .
my question to you is : why should that be ?
that is the key problem .
the european parliament had already made its decision clear , and what it wanted was to achieve a directive .
we had to take a decision .
my group will have a free vote on it and i believe others will as well .
but they have far less at the moment .
things can change .
mr president , one final point .
but we should let the commissioner have his wish !
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , on a point of order .
( applause )
mr president , on a point of order .
vote
( parliament approved the proposal )
( parliament approved the joint text )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is why we in the freedom party have voted against it .
the next item is the joint debate on two reports :
however , there are other points in the resolution with which i would not agree .
welcome
that applies to all of us , in fact .
that is not how things work .
we would welcome a review of your decision .
i would like to make a few final points .
i would welcome your opinion on this matter .
i wish you all the best in the implementation of that project .
we want an independent bank .
this is an essential point , in our view .
no , there is not .
does this prevent us from discussing monetary policy ?
it does not .
it is therefore only fair to do justice to the concerns of all the parties involved .
thank you very much for that .
that does mean , however , that we still have a great deal to do .
i would also like to make a few points clear for the benefit of the public .
it was europe that wanted a single currency , so europe will now have to put take responsibility for it !
for this reason we too will not be voting for three of the proposals made by the rapporteur in her report .
that is the reason why we cannot vote for this second proposal .
our single currency is as strong as the economy behind it .
this is why i feel i may be allowed to focus on three points .
mr president , i shall try to answer some of the points raised by members .
i wish to add some points .
many points were made about the resolution .
i agree with her completely .
the answer is " no " .
we encourage that .
i agree with the decisions that have been taken by the various countries .
nevertheless , this is a national decision , which must be taken by each member state .
why is this directive needed ?
what is this directive about ?
it is a financial services directive .
nor is it a compromise .
i would like to particularly address the commission and the representatives of the council .
in this respect we are responsible for something that we wish to establish , something that , at the end of the day , must work and must benefit our citizens .
however , in this case we agree with the reference to national employment law .
i refer , in particular , to the coordination of economic policies .
what is the content of this communication ?
what is the proposed procedure ?
employment strategy is one example .
of course , there is close cooperation between the committee on employment and social affairs and the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
they are going to present a joint report and their contribution is crucial , but the european parliament can play an important role in this process .
we wish to have your opinion on this communication and , in particular , the objectives proposed .
what will the commissioner do ?
i hope that the commissioner will agree with me .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for the statement .
i look forward to reading the communication .
this will become essential .
mr president , there are two main issues here .
there are major problems in this area at present .
clear information should be available on demand .
commissioner , i should like to ask you two questions .
the first one concerns the objectives included in the document .
that has not been provided for in the plan .
so far so good .
these are problems common to all countries .
question time ( commission )
part 1
so where do we stand today in the implementation of the project ?
but i understand well why the question has been put .
mr president , i should like to thank the commissioner very much .
the short answer is ' no ' .
we do not have any other information concerning their cases .
second part
i believe our position on this point to be effective .
so my question is whether the commission could take an initiative in this area .
that is a very good question .
this applies to the wto 's current legislation .
has there been any discussion on this ?
do you believe this is a possibility ?
this is our position .
we have some way to go before this can be done .
this is the situation at the current time .
we are aware of your concerns in this area .
thank you , commissioner .
i am just a little concerned by what i see .
you have raised a different problem .
the commission is fully aware of the situation of the parties .
i first want to thank the commissioner for his reply .
i agree with you about that .
and that is not acceptable , commissioner .
when will the commission state its position on this very important matter ?
mr president , it is always good to put the final question at question time .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his excellent answer .
is this your final opinion ?
security can only come after that .
there is nothing new about that .
how should this be done ?
no answer is given to this question .
there are a number of such questions .
help has now been given to financial markets . all that remains is to help the people .
i will not be part of that majority .
everything that can be said has already been said about that .
the proposal for a directive does not say a word about it , because that is not its purpose .
that has been discussed by many members in this debate .
i should now like to give the opinion of the commission on the specific amendments .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
i would like to comment on both proposals at the same time , as the two have a great deal in common .
the legal affairs committee approved the proposal and had no comment to make on it .
it is clear that there is general agreement that we should get on with these reforms as quickly as possible .
it is fair to say that this report has been a good example of successful cooperation between our two institutions .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
now let me turn to the key positive results .
she has made considerable progress .
we need other measures as well as this directive .
i know the commissioner would agree on the need for a framework for energy support .
i very much look forward to a positive result tomorrow .
where should we focus our attention ?
i would especially like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur .
the compromise that is now before us is the best that can be achieved .
it is naturally also vital for the candidate countries and the developing countries .
having said this , i would like to go back to two difficult points , which were raised at the beginning of our discussions :
furthermore , we believe that the proposals in amendments nos 2 and 4 are not necessary and we agree with and support the proposal in amendment no 11 .
in a year and two months - since the commission approved its proposal - we are going to have an approved directive .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
for it to be successful we want companies and organisations to use it .
that is very important .
we do not want them to feel that they are going to be held back in any way .
i would like to know if possible from the commissioner what action he has taken to deal with this possible conflict in the future .
on this point , i am not in agreement with the report before us .
i should like to home in on a few points .
that is the right way forward in my view .
i believe that that is what it is all about .
finally , my third point .
i believe that you have taken an important step for the european union .
there are however , some proposed amendments which the commission cannot agree with .
the debate is closed .
, rapporteur .
on the other hand , policy guidelines also have to be implemented . we are therefore talking about technical implementation measures here .
instead , only the commission and the council will decide on these matters .
the different needs of different regions also need to be taken into account .
i would like to see support for these two amendments .
i should like to congratulate her on the quality of her report .
i believe that that is not the case .
what can we do ?
mr president , i would like to thank all three institutions .
but i would also like to thank the commission and the council .
my group has , in any case , tabled certain amendments .
i hope that the house will be able to accept these amendments .
i hope that we will have your support for this and i hope that the commission will be able to live with this amendment .
it is important that we have transparency in the use of these .
as has been mentioned , it is actually the institutional issues which are difficult .
we talk about technical implementation provisions .
however , i hope we agree that what in this context have been called technical implementation measures do not include technical matters .
that would be too much .
this proposal is part of a whole which the commission would like to see adopted by the end of the year .
today , following discussion in the committee , the issue is having its first reading in the european parliament .
for this reason the commission cannot accept those amendments from parliament which conflict with the central approach of our proposal for a decision .
the debate is closed .
that was not the purpose of the euro .
( applause )
finally , food safety .
we want to continue down that road .
quite rightly so , too .
what does it mean to people ?
we need clear agreements .
who does what at what level ?
at the moment , the union does not have full budgetary powers of its own .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
what is important are the following two matters .
thank you for your attention .
this too is an issue the convention must address .
however , it would not be responsible for me , as president of the commission , to give that answer .
it is , and will remain , our number one political objective .
no , it is not .
( applause )
my third point is transparency .
( applause )
thank you , madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen .
the question is now to know whether the way we are going to deal with them will be effective .
we need one .
another crucial point is the place of the union in the world .
do the european citizens know this ?
do it in your own country , but not in the european parliament !
the president-in-office has our full support where the defence of democracy and the rule of law in europe are concerned .
a final point .
i shall now come back to three points .
i wish you every success .
no , it is not .
what is more , the vote was about the same as at the elections to the european parliament .
i agree , and that ' more ' is to ask the question , ' is integration the solution or the problem ? '
allow me , in this connection , to make two comments .
but more is required than that .
the union must also work through , and carry to a conclusion , the decisions that it has taken and is still taking .
and you have already mentioned a number of things .
i should like to make two comments in this debate .
enlargement must be a success for europe .
this is the point - it has even been said today - on which council , commission and parliament all agree .
why do we not simply say : we want enlargement towards the east , but no country is prepared to pay even one additional euro towards the cost of this .
( applause )
we need to make them feel like european citizens .
you should include this project among your priorities .
add this to your priorities and try to agree a relevant course of action with the countries of europe .
you will need our support and you will also have it .
to achieve this we need , above all , your support .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
i believe that , in them , we have two representatives of the european community who are in a position to do good there .
nevertheless , i have two concerns .
is the council involved ?
do you support that ?
it will not be the first time !
they can see economic and democratic development .
there is a need for that development throughout this area .
europe has done no such thing .
i hope that , even if the president-in-office of the council cannot answer now , he will take the concerns of all the groups very seriously and bring them before the council of ministers .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i shall very quickly answer all the questions that have been raised .
the debate is closed .
vote
( parliament approved the common position )
( parliament approved the proposal by the commission )
( parliament approved the proposal by the commission )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote
but if you voted on this then i will not put the question .
did you vote on this matter ?
i believe that is the point .
i did not rule out the possibility that i would be in this situation .
i may well have done the wrong thing , but that is how things are .
it is their decision .
this result is absolutely clear .
there is no majority in favour of the report and we should not call this result into question .
i congratulate you on this .
the council and the commission can help us in that regard .
before the vote
with regard to this directive , i would like to address not only the commission , but also the council .
regarding amendment no 11
very well , we shall take note of this .
very well .
madam president , thank you for giving me the floor .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i have to say that this is not my first !
i believe her and so i voted for the motion .
we have therefore voted in favour .
what are the problems ?
1 .
2 .
3 .
4 .
i hope the debate will continue .
why is that ?
"
that is why we voted against the joint motion for a resolution .
let us begin , for example , with the institutional issues .
and it is still going on .
our only hope is that one good thing will come out of it , namely that this experience will help change the course of europe tomorrow .
today , during this final stage , the member states have a crucial role to play .
first of all , however , i believe it is essential for you to make a statement on your view of the situation .
welcome
human rights in the world and eu fundamental rights
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
our report is now called a report on fundamental rights rather than a report on human rights .
i think we had to do so .
at any rate , that is my hope .
i believe that that is the role we must play .
that means it is still very young .
in fact , europe still has its whole future before it .
in fact this process is already under way .
we now have to focus on the implementation of its proposals .
clearly , it has achieved its objective .
without doubt , it will help promote a community culture when it comes to the protection of fundamental rights .
their time will come !
that is the reality and that is why we need a new approach .
we need it now .
however , coordination between the eu institutions and between the eu and member states could still be better .
we will continue to do this .
today we can do more than we could yesterday and no doubt less than tomorrow , but even that is very important .
thank you very much , mr president .
they are both very good reports .
for all these reasons , it is important that we support these reports .
they have no place here .
secondly , there is the question : who does what ?
i think we have to .
that must stop .
this is what i wanted to say to him .
we need to apply even more pressure .
what is the european union doing ?
however , there is one problem .
that is what we want .
this also applies to the right of children to education .
what do we mean when we talk about human rights ?
we all agree on this .
the focus is on economic relations , trade agreements , financial assistance , and so on .
there is much to do in this area .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are we prepared for this , i ask ?
all the other countries of europe increased them .
i should like to say one last word about economic issues .
we all know that .
as has been said a few times , we can , and must , as europe , play a global role in this debate .
i should like to add one point to the debate .
what is the solution ?
the joint debate is closed .
question time ( council )
as they deal with the same subject , questions nos 1 to 10 will be taken together .
that being the case , all i can tell you is that it is too soon .
i am able to speak from experience .
to that extent i believe that the debate will progress in the right direction in the years to come .
in my first answer i said everything i could say as president-in-office .
these levels and authorities have a very important role to play .
you can see , then , how we deal with questions of this type .
i would ask you to think about that .
it is not possible for me to reply to your question .
as you know , the european parliament has approved this approach in its opinion on the framework regulation for turkey .
i would like to address the issue of turkey .
my reply was in response to your specific question about an international committee .
the council has had some discussions on this proposal , but has not come up with any conclusions yet .
in this respect , we share the position of the united states and i believe that that in itself was a very good move .
i fully support the commission on this point .
this has always been the position of this house and also our group .
this is a positive development .
on this point , i would like to make a comment about the future of the country .
for a long time , there were no relations .
that also applies to the assessment of that aid .
mr president , i can only speak for a majority of my group on this issue .
we support the commission 's proposal and the report .
what contribution is the european community making at the moment ?
secondly , the political conditions .
you request additional reports to parliament .
there are two problems .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports , tabled on behalf of the committee on budgets :
i should also like to make several comments on the issue of own resources .
let me say this quite clearly : we have other priorities first .
finally , at the end of this process , decisions must be taken on how the necessary resources can be made available .
yet again , there are a number of problems for next year .
( applause )
as the basis for negotiations , it must not address issues on which parliament has the final say .
that is why we can only make some general comments at this stage .
in my opinion , that can be an extremely difficult issue in this procedure .
it is no longer a matter of money .
i should like to put this to you now .
we will return to the other issues in due course .
i think this is wrong .
we made a very clear statement on this issue during the year .
the money then goes back into the relevant national budgets .
we must move away from this situation .
why were these amendments not made at the time ?
mr president , i wish to speak about own resources .
that was voted down by parliament only a few months ago .
i accept that .
that is why i have tabled four amendments tomorrow for voting .
we on the committee on budgets have reached agreement on most areas .
this is something that the council must not change .
in this context , i would like to point out the view of the committee on agriculture and rural development .
in addition , there is a need for developed proposals from the commission .
i therefore believe that the commission should adopt a structural approach in order to improve the situation .
it comes around every year .
therefore we must keep up our efforts in this direction .
this is acceptable to the commission .
that applies to everyone , it applies to the commission , it applies to parliament and it also applies , of course , to the council .
now to the present motion for a resolution on own resources .
that is what it says in the treaty .
that is not what it is about at all .
now a word on administrative expenditure .
there will also be close cooperation in the field of any actions included in the budget by the european parliament .
that cannot be true .
thank you .
thank you commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
management of community programmes
therefore , madam commissioner , in principle you have the support of the rapporteur and the support of the committee on budgetary control .
that is not our objective .
that may be right .
i should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on the report that is before us today .
that is our strong view .
i have not had it .
this is an issue of fundamental importance to us .
i have not received it .
the debate is closed .
the content of this waste and the extent of the problem are also not entirely clear .
we would like more research in this area .
we know that the situation may be more serious in many candidate countries than it is in the present member states .
i , as rapporteur , and the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , believe that this is the right approach .
thank you for such excellent cooperation .
i hope you will be able to agree to this amendment and i congratulate you once again on your report .
on behalf of my group , i welcome the commission 's report and the rapporteur 's report .
we think it is excellent .
we really have to take into account all sectors in the community .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
when it comes to environmental issues we need an international approach .
this has to be taken into account .
this should not be allowed .
but it will benefit our environment in the long term .
why a legal framework ?
this is not the case in every country , however .
on that point i agree with other members .
this is what we should be doing .
we have yet to decide how to provide this vital protection .
that is why the commission proposal is so welcome .
let me turn to the key issues raised in the amendments proposed .
there are , however , certain amendments which the commission cannot accept .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i wanted to say that in this house .
i think it is very important that they should be able to do so .
the european union has taken a strong lead .
many issues remain , and we must make sure that the fund 's focus and management is in line with the objectives of the european union action plan .
i will just make one final point .
it was not of course without reason that he said this .
where is europe ?
they have a right to know what is going on .
we need much more than that , however .
i will focus on this last aspect .
the political importance is clear : this is a point of no return for the member states but also for the candidate countries and third countries .
why ?
when will these things happen ?
we need financial stability on the markets .
the debate is closed .
i will not mention all of them ( the house will be pleased to know ) .
in other words , it is something our society can do without .
it is therefore right and proper that we should want to improve on one or two points in this directive .
this cannot be done from one day to the next .
i would thank the rapporteur for a good proposal .
the debate is closed .
what have we done in the face of this situation ?
what did parliament receive more than a year later ?
in the main , the programme is a success .
i did this report in the last parliament .
i have three points that i want to make .
this really is not the way it should be .
i am very well aware of the difficult work conditions and the time pressure .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i thank him for his excellent work on this matter .
i think that is a very important point .
i believe , however , we are talking about the same subject matter .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
only in this way will the citizens see europe in a positive light .
we do not think that a tax specific to the eu would be a good idea at all .
i have voted against the proposal .
we do not want to increase the number of tax levels in society for our citizens .
this is a development which we do not want to support .
we do not wish to support such a development .
i call upon parliament and our institutions not to give another euro to countries which do not respect human rights in the world .
i welcome the call for a better eu human rights strategy towards third countries and candidate countries .
it must end as soon as possible .
that is going too far .
that cannot be allowed to happen .
we have therefore made progress .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i believe that commitment also means talking in clear and open terms .
that is why there is hope .
i feel certain of this .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
human rights
i do not want to talk about the whole motion for a resolution today , however .
i hope we will carry the motion for a resolution and make that point .
finally , mr president , we think it is important to be in a position to establish a european solidarity fund for the world 's children .
i should like to ask the commissioner something about this .
at least ten are required for it to come into force .
we shall not vote against .
there is cause for hope , however .
it is a first step in the right direction .
do you really wish to speak now ?
this is completely unacceptable .
this is completely unacceptable .
we all know what this country has been through .
that is not all .
we need to work on this .
we will continue to support progress and to take every opportunity to draw attention to the fundamental importance of freedom of opinion .
the most recent one is currently being implemented .
that is something we have done , are doing and will continue to do .
how could we not be ?
thank you very much commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
that is clear .
thank you very much commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
i will not go over them again as we already know what they are .
that says it all .
thank you very much indeed commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
our group is going to support this report from the first line to the last .
we support that . we think it is a good idea .
my report comes later . i want to take the opportunity to congratulate him on an excellent report .
the fact that we have not been able to give it that priority in the member states is certainly something that we all view with great concern .
the debate is closed .
thanks also to the commission .
i certainly welcome that .
to a large extent this report is technical , as i have said .
i hope it is successful .
i hope , commissioner , you will encourage the cooperation that is required .
it has come about to achieve this technical agreement .
that is the way forward .
the situation is no longer sustainable .
that is why regional management is the way forward .
the debate is closed .
vote
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we cannot be content with this state of affairs .
statement by the president
unfortunately , this cost him his life .
you and i are members of parliament .
since this has been done , however , i would just like to say one or two words on the matter .
agenda
is this the issue that we are discussing and voting on ?
madam president , we see how seriously my party takes matters in this house .
president .
i have some information to share with you .
) , rapporteur .
why ?
that is something for the various groups to do .
i would also like to express my support for the motion for a resolution .
this is also provided for in the agenda .
so , how shall we deal with this ?
would you address the president of that parliament ?
parliament has a major role to play .
once again , i shall certainly do so .
they include the european union , which has a particular responsibility now that turkey is a candidate country .
the next item is the joint debate on :
we must finally take the first step , however .
nevertheless , i believe we should be very pleased with the progress made on this extremely important subject .
this will benefit a europe that has the euro and the internal market .
he is quite right .
i should know .
it will come back and we will improve it .
however , it is a step in the right direction and i support it .
we have already referred to this within the committee .
the council , not the commission and not parliament : the council is the problem !
so we do not need parliament .
this is the strategy of the council .
why should it be adopted ?
i , for one , cannot see any .
we can be very clear about this .
he asked me particularly to make that point to you .
i have never seen such a light regulation or proposed regulation as this one .
as soon as the vote is over , we must carry on and get back down to work on this issue .
management alone cannot make important decisions .
i would also like to thank him for being more specific in response to proposals from my group .
why is that ?
however , i am going to support it , of course .
other changes might be needed .
we are agreed upon the objectives .
i would , however , like to stress three points that i consider to be vital .
within this context , these proposals have the support of our group .
i support many of the proposals made in the report .
we either want responsible social partners , or we do not .
mr president , i am pleased to support this report .
i hope that this debate will help achieve that .
may tomorrow 's vote be just as successful !
there is no doubt that this has been a success .
that remains the commission 's strong view .
the debate is closed .
monitoring application of community law ( 1999 )
i should like to use the time left to draw a few general conclusions .
i do not wish to take up any more of your time but i would like to say a word or two about the amendments .
i can accept two of the three proposed amendments .
what does more europe mean ?
this is a fundamental problem .
we do not think so .
in addition , in a democracy , it is not the business of the court of justice to create legislation through case law .
we need to be aware of these issues .
the debate is closed .
commission reform
i would like to say to him that it is not through lack of effort on our part that it has taken a long time to get this question on the agenda .
i shall now come back to budgetary concerns relating to the reform .
in any case , we need a response .
that is a matter of interest and requires a focus from all of us .
all of the reform investment is essential .
we do not know whether this is yet under way .
when will this be ?
i could go on and on .
you know that you have our support .
all these points go together .
we have to keep this as short as possible .
in conclusion , we have made significant progress .
moreover , i hope that this has not created too much in the way of difficulties for the commission in the negotiations .
so what is our main cause for concern ?
no more no less .
i hope that this house will continue to show the same commitment .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
it is a report of parliament .
thank you , madam president .
( applause )
thank you .
there are no other points of order .
of course , he does much more than that .
( applause )
so what can the european union do in these circumstances ?
this is an area in which parliament has quite rightly taken a particularly strong interest .
( applause )
( applause from the right )
there is no other , at the moment at least .
but what is the united states doing ?
that is not what i want at all .
yet , we still have a great deal to do in order to achieve this .
and , secondly , the european union must have a single commitment and that commitment is the cause of peace .
without a doubt , europe must act .
did you demand transparency , commissioner ?
did they even subject their funding to any conditions ?
the problem is how to put them into effect .
we want to be involved , but we are not accepted .
madam president , i have a question for the president-in-office .
can the council give us more information ?
i should like to know .
i want to be very clear on this .
the meeting will , therefore , take place tomorrow .
the debate is closed .
progress of the 12 candidate countries in 2000
the next item is the joint debate on :
it is a matter for the european union and the candidate countries alone .
( applause )
in today 's debate , i should like to discuss three questions with you .
why enlargement ?
enlargement is the future of europe .
so , what stage have the negotiations reached ?
in some of these areas , considerable progress was made .
in addition , the union must also step up its efforts in the field of the common foreign and security policy .
by way of conclusion , i should like to say that enlargement remains a political project .
that has been the case with each new accession .
madam president , madam president-in-office of the council , ladies and gentlemen , it is almost a year since the european parliament 's last major debate on enlargement .
we reached agreement on it in our debate last year .
we shall need as much freedom of movement as possible , and for a number of years also as much security as possible .
the commission has to look to the interests of the union as a whole .
it is in the interests of the union as a whole that enlargement should not demand more of any member state than it is actually able to give .
i want to turn now to the situation in the candidate countries themselves .
( applause )
the overall economic situation is another matter .
most of the positive economic effects are already with us .
now one question remains . how can we ensure that people in the european union and in the candidate countries will agree to the objective of enlargement ?
we need to make greater efforts here .
then , the key issue is : what does europe still mean to the people in the european union ?
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
it need not be 10 , but it may be 10 .
we are prepared for that .
there are many points there .
but that does not mean that enlargement will come at no cost .
it has its price .
it costs much more than enlargement .
and there we are only at the start of the debate .
but it is very clear that that alone will not be enough .
in that regard there is the question of the free movement of labour .
the enlargement of the union is an economic and political opportunity for europe .
welcome
you are most welcome to the house .
given the way in which the enlargement negotiations are at present going , a majority of people in one or more countries is going to vote against .
we will take that up with the commission services and see if we can get it to you as quickly as possible .
vote
according to my text , it is quite clear .
that is the text that we are voting on .
( parliament adopted the resolution ) president .
i fully supported the text as adopted by the council .
i know the problem .
however , we will make that point as often as we can .
in my view sufficient account has not been taken of this and that is why i have voted against .
as things stand , they receive no information at all .
"
we are no further forward on this .
that applies just as much in our own countries .
finally , allow me to make one further comment which i already made last year in my report .
a free vote in parliament is not always the best solution in this connection .
some of these measures are already in place .
there are no particular problems as regards human rights .
despite the difficulties , the work that has been carried out is considerable .
i would once more congratulate them on their responsible approach .
we must not make demands of others that we do not make of ourselves .
the european union should be more than a market .
we all know that a common european defence would cost a fair amount of money .
however , those in favour are not alone by any means .
after all , there are a number of difficult issues left to deal with .
i would add that this is already the case today .
it is important that no more demands should be made now .
there is more than a little to do in the eu , as well .
mr president , i think this is an excellent set of reports and that the committee on foreign affairs has done a good job .
i think we need to look into all this .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to make five points from the point of view of the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
secondly , the economic data show positive developments .
we have reached an important stage .
i should like to make one crucial point .
i take one particular example .
for reasons of solidarity , therefore , we must vote against the reports .
this is why it is vital that we give our attention to this development .
i should first like to turn my attention to social security .
my experience and the discussions i have had in a number of countries show this to be true .
secondly , i should like to mention the organisations which are being set up and developed by the social partners .
let us help them and let us help the social partners to help each other .
the same applies to me .
but there is more .
i said this morning that enlargement is the future of the union .
that is absolutely certain .
i fully agree with this .
this is an important task which we need to carry out together step by step .
to my mind these are crucial to european values .
mr president , enlargement is not an end in itself . it is clearly a means ; i would go further , it is a means within a group of means .
if it is a means , what is the end ?
firstly , in the political field .
we can only fully agree with him .
enlargement must be supported and well received by national public opinion .
why should this be the case ?
i think this is too soon .
this is the problem .
the debate is closed .
that is one important aspect .
but we are prepared to discuss this with you .
are you for or against it ?
( applause )
that is positive .
but i have other concerns .
this reading of the problem is simply not true .
in my opinion , this text does not go far enough .
finally , relations with parliament .
i therefore believe that we must work together to that end .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
part i
there is no other organisation in the world like it .
i thank the commissioner for his response .
we have our own specific procedures for scientific assessment as well as for the framework programme and the european investment bank has its own financial and economic criteria .
this work is in progress .
it is very important that we play our part in this common work .
would the commissioner agree with this particular statement ?
i shall answer the last part of the question first .
we will continue with this .
thank you very much , commissioner .
i do not think we have a problem .
i think that this is not just a national question . there are also political aspects which i do not expect you to take completely in hand , but they are there .
is there anything you can do about this ?
thank you , commissioner .
i should just like to ask two more questions .
we have to address that issue .
we can agree with them or not , but these principles were only decided on by them .
that is as much as we can say now .
many thanks to the commissioner for his answer .
i will come back to the honourable member of parliament on the first question as soon as possible .
mr president , the commission is aware of the matters for concern which have been raised by the honourable member .
mr president , the commission left final decision making until after the opinion of the council and parliament had been heard .
there is therefore no specific basic technology .
i thank the commissioner for his answer .
this process is now well under way .
but it seems to me that what you are saying is that the commission is not going to do anything to follow up its communication or its action plan .
the conference was a success , particularly for the european union .
i hope to continue our good cooperation in the future .
there is no going back now .
a real change has to take place .
it would be all to the good if more countries were to follow that example .
i would like to congratulate and thank you .
i was pleased with aspects of the deal , the compromise over nuclear power for example was as good as we could get .
what matters , however , is the process that has now been established .
you have still a lot to do .
i thank you again .
there are very good reasons for doing so .
these issues are of concern to us .
but it is an important first step .
and we need to tell them as much again and again .
well done .
i just wanted to point that out .
the very fact of having been there is , i think a very good thing .
it is a global task , for which europe must take its share of the responsibility .
sustainable development must lead to sustainable growth .
it is now time for action .
however , we took the initiative from the very beginning and we were able to carry it through to an international agreement .
now we can work within that .
we can change and develop it .
i would like your cooperation .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
safety and air transport
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
my group has also tabled a number of proposed amendments .
my second important point concerns the problem of political control .
so , ladies and gentlemen , these are the main conclusions of the committee on industry .
all of those are possible if we adopt these two reports .
also from my own experience , it is clear that many things often go wrong .
i should like to mention two more things .
mr president , on behalf of the green group i would like to welcome both of these reports .
that is beginning to change but there is still a long way to go .
in this respect we support your proposal .
i look forward to the commission 's response .
mr president , commissioner , first of all , i should like to congratulate the commission and particularly the commissioner on the various important initiatives being put forward for this sector .
initiatives such as those that we are now discussing are , therefore , of great importance to the european public .
mr president , i should like to say , first of all , that we are discussing two quite different initiatives here .
on the other hand , we cannot accept some of the proposed amendments .
we can only accept proposals being tabled later on these matters .
it is , therefore , important that the commission has the support of parliament on this matter .
i should like to congratulate your rapporteur once again and thank you for the excellent work you have carried out .
this is crucial .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
now the commission does not like this agreement .
which is why the whole thing makes no sense .
on this basis , the commission proposal is therefore legal .
something needs to be done here .
i see two points at issue here .
secondly , how serious are we about our european environmental and transport policy ?
then you would be doing something for environmental protection .
vote in favour of the commission proposal .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the long term , our views are not so very different .
why do i say this ?
because in the commission 's proposal , which we share and support , we see the same environmental concern .
all that does no more good to the environment than it does to the transport system .
perhaps .
i am not saying that it is the solution , but it could be one .
mr president , i should like to stress that the commissioner was quite right in what she said .
the debate is closed .
cultural cooperation in the eu
we are different and united at the same time : this is an opportunity to show it !
the commission is currently trying to come up with procedures that will , in its opinion , provide a better response to these problems .
i should like to make a few points .
it is possible to do it when we need to .
cultural policy is one of the eu 's small policy areas , and that is the way it should be , too .
and i hope that means a lot of people at all levels .
do they not think that it is time to state that a european culture does indeed exist , to develop joint cultural policies and to set common objectives for all our member states ?
one final comment .
yet together , i am sure that we will get there .
point 4 : culture and the information society .
we are therefore in agreement on the basis .
they know each other , they know what each other are doing , they can work together , they can think of common actions to take in cooperation with one another , and how to apply them in practice .
i will return to this subject .
together , we shall get down to the job .
as you can see , i have been very positive up to this point .
in my opinion , they are fundamental .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i will ask the services to make sure that is done .
( the minutes were approved )
one of our assessment criteria must be to ask what our own services actually do .
why ever not ?
there is no world government to protect them .
( applause )
parliament will soon issue an opinion , at first reading , on this important text .
this is a general principle , which we can only support .
in short , it is a rather difficult case .
let me thank the rapporteur once again for his cooperation with us .
they exist and they will continue to exist .
this can only be achieved if there is a system for democratic monitoring .
but this is not the vital and fundamental issue .
the european parliament should be in no doubt about this .
this situation is now very different .
did you hear that , commissioner ?
if so , what does it do ?
and is there a need for democratic initiatives ?
so in my view it is no solution .
that is why i shall not be able to support it .
you have all carried out important work .
it took a long time for us to establish this , however .
we have important work to do in this area .
these are questions which the report does not answer .
i should also like to thank parliament as a whole for this very important debate .
the commission has been following the parliamentary work over the past year with great interest .
i would ask for your support in this context in our discussions on the next framework programme .
i am pleased to note that the conclusions of the report under discussion are very much in line with the approach adopted by the commission .
thank you very much for that .
i thank the members of the committee .
some of them are mentioned in the report .
there are others who have not been mentioned in their own interest .
( applause )
such measures should not be necessary .
the problem is for europe . it is a problem for european democracy as a whole .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a report about terrorism .
whether it is a crime is another matter .
what , then , should be parliament 's role ?
we have to face up to the fact that there has not been full cooperation between member states .
the member states must be free to protect their citizens .
this too is a form of terrorism .
and i am going to make my second point , mr president .
this is the way to move forward together in europe and to deal with the real concerns of the citizens , as has been said here .
the debate is closed .
welcome

before the vote
i have also discussed this matter with the rapporteur .
in that framework , as rapporteur , i support this amendment .
i hope my group will follow my lead .
before the vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
madam president , i voted against this report because it makes no mention of state terrorism .
i think that we should take more action in this direction .
we therefore voted against this report .
madam president , in terms of the european union 's enlargement process in general , i have to say that i voted for the motion .
" why are you doing that ?
" i asked him .
this is the reason why we have not voted for this report .
i do not agree .
for these reasons , we were not able to vote for this report .
for these reasons , we were not able to vote for this report .
why is that ?
"
1 .
2 .
3 .
however , there are 3 main reasons why i voted against the report .
there is no real answer .
thus , i cannot support the report .
but what consequences did he draw from this ?
i do not agree with this .
madam president-in-office of the council , i give you the floor .
the summit took a number of important decisions .
there is no more talk of that .
in my view , that is essential .
i will not go into that today .
is a european way possible ?
these are the things we must do in this house , and i hope we shall all work together to achieve them .
but that is not the problem i want to deal with today .
if we act on our own behalf , let us then show that we mean business .
what is our response ?
what is this parliament 's response ?
we are going to do all of this .
that is the responsibility of the european union , of the european parliament .
i therefore believe that we will have to ensure that progress is made in terms of democracy and freedom for all .
i wish to make that very clear to you .
i can tell you that we too believe in the global approach .
of course they do not go far enough .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
they can be seen as technical in nature .
why ?
perhaps this would be appropriate once again today ?
!
we want you , commissioner , to take action in this area .
it is like old times .
we talk and talk and we change absolutely nothing when it comes to the council 's position .
we made our point . nothing happened .
it just does not make sense .
that is something that we need to be talking about .
what are we going to do about administrative expenditure , especially in relation to enlargement ?
that is a priority for us both .
question time ( council )
that is all that i can say at this moment .
i take that into account .
that is something i know .
you can ask the question again if you wish .
we are doing all we can to achieve this .
this question will therefore have to be put to the committee at the appropriate time .
mr president , i would like to thank the president-in-office for her answer , if you could call it that .
i would add that i hope it will also be a fair conclusion .
those regions must be taken into consideration .
i would ask the president-in-office to keep an open mind .
i would therefore request her to turn to the commission for additional information .
has there been coordination with the european union ?
she will therefore understand that for these reasons i cannot answer the questions she has just asked .
i have two things to say in response to the comments and questions we have just heard .
consumers in every country will face the same problem .
that is the situation in my country .
"
the european union is a union of common values .
there has been no question but rather a statement .
we take note of your statement , which is not a question .
if not , would it like any help from the parliament , which has been open to the public for so many years already ?
then we would have real democracy in the council .
will you do that next ?
but as you heard from my answer , there is a lot of progress and we will see .
it seems to me that specific questions were asked and you should at least have allowed the president-in-office to reply .
she always has the opportunity .
thank you very much .
that is all i can say about the situation at this stage .
thank you very much , madam president-in-office .
statement by the president
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
why do we have this situation ?
in this it will certainly be supported , even though , unfortunately , our legislative powers do not exist in this area .
then you must actually pay for them .
so we have to call an end to this and that costs money .
that is the question before us and we must give it further consideration .
we have received different information about this .
the question is whether it is effective , especially if it is only adopted by the european union .
of course , it is important to take values into account here .
i think there is a great deal of work to be done in this area , especially as regards security in the commission and the parliament .
i think that action is needed here .
the second reason is the cost issue which has been mentioned by many .
firstly the situation in the united states .
i have done it myself .
we discussed these issues earlier today in this house .
i mentioned two of these earlier .
but i have to ask him another question .
perhaps the commissioner can give us an answer to that .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
implementation of competition rules
parliament agreed with these objectives .
this is part of established legal reality in the majority of member states .
in my view , we have to decide one way or the other .
thank you very much .
i wish we could see more of this in other areas too .
without your and the commission 's efforts , such progress would never have been made on this issue and consumers would never have received help .
article 3 is clearly vital .
article 10 is another important article .
services of general interest also need to be mentioned in this particular respect .
mr president , there is a general agreement that we clearly need some reform in some competition rules , and especially in their practical implementation .
with the reform at hand we are able to achieve many of our objectives .
in this context , the reform proposed by the commission does not change the current situation at all .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this system applies to member states .
absolutely not .
in my opinion , no .
we believe that when the system is applied to them , the candidate countries will already be members of the european union and therefore no special guarantee system will be necessary .
this is subject to a technical debate .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
there is therefore a risk to the environment and to human health .
the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy does not share this view .
i mentioned that just now .
the general conclusions are clear .
however , the commission can , in principle , support the first part of amendment no 2 .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
what are those principles ?
that is one reason .
this directive is essential .
i hope members will support it tomorrow .
after all , as members , we should lead by example .
nor can we take any from other countries in europe .
firstly there is a safety risk .
is this what we really want for others and ourselves ?
there is one already .
many of the amendments will improve the proposal .
you have the floor , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
but it does not .
( applause )
in these thanks i wish to include your colleagues .
one , it must be based in law .
citizens need to know where they stand and precisely what their rights are in dealing with the institutions .
this is very important .
applause
the european parliament 's committee on budgetary control has the same problem .
mr president , the joint debate of these three reports is an important debate .
i do not think it is appropriate .
we must carry the administrative reform through .
we need to have more information available so we do not at present have a position on the matter .
the debate is closed .
this was the case for the report for which i was responsible .
that is our first problem .
why would they ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the subject of this debate is the same as for the previous one , namely relations between the european institutions and the citizens .
the debate is closed .
we therefore propose that we do not accept this proposal .
there is therefore an amendment from the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy in this respect .
a positive list should be given .
there is no such thing .
the debate is closed .
parliament approved this by a clear majority .
in other words , we clearly decided in the legislative act to adopt the commission proposal .
vote
you can now do one of two things .
( the matter was referred back to the committee responsible )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i do not understand why .
we will deal with the compromise amendment later .
absolutely right .
i would ask if the amendment can be accepted .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the first amendment is the additional paragraph on terrorism .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( applause )
that was not the agreement .
ladies and gentlemen , it is high time we voted .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is why i have voted in favour , mr president .
i voted against both these reports .
the fact that i voted against does not mean to say that i am not concerned about these issues .
this business could not exist in the eu .
it is a step in the right direction .
'
as a result , we did not vote in favour of the report .
that is an excellent thing .
no comment .
food aid will be a different matter .
there are a number of other things going on as well .
that makes it extremely important .
those are the kind of important things that the european union can do .
the debate is closed .
let me be clear about this .
another question .
a further question .
finally i should like to know something about the costs .
we must look at that .
is that a successful policy ?
the commission needs to change its strategy .
so what is the commission 's opinion ?
we shall take the necessary measures from the point of view of budgetary procedure .
that is just one aspect of this issue .
the debate is closed .
human rights
there is no reason for it , there is no need .
he has done well .
it is better for the president of the country and the people of the country .
there is increasing violence .
in this matter , we have an international political humanitarian responsibility .
having said this , i should just like to say a few words about the motion for a resolution that we shall be voting on next .
mr president , allow me to take up the various points which have been mentioned during this debate , and to let you know the commission 's position .
so far , our approach has not had any effect .
at any rate , that is what the presidency seems to think .
this is not true .
to my mind , therefore , the president took absolutely the right line .
the debate is closed .
we can understand that .
mr president , what are we doing ?
there is no doubt about that .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i agree with what other members have said .
the debate is closed .
now a few words on individual demands set out in the report .
we have to consider too that we will have a conflict .
the same rules apply to rural development and the common organisations of the market .
the debate is closed
basic education in developing countries
the eu clearly has a key and central role to play here .
it is only 1 % of the total .
as far as the eu is concerned , i hope the commissioner will agree that this is not enough .
i would like to know when we might expect to see that .
good , free education is essential for development .
that education must be free .
the debate is closed .
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we must go further .
"
"
then it was a european problem for certain states .
we can make common cause in this matter , and we must do so . '
cooperation is also required .
that is the only way to guarantee security and democracy in that country .
we only have one world and we are all responsible for it and its people .
we must take sustainable development seriously .
our world will never be the same again .
today , we must review this issue .
that remains to be seen .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
statement by the president
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to draw your attention to a communication that i shall now give to you on security measures at the european parliament .
welcome
terrorism is an international problem and as such requires a global response .
( applause )
we must show the american people and the american authorities that they have the solidarity of the whole european union .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
for this reason , our group has tabled an amendment to the budget for the year 2002 .
the time for words is now past !
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
i welcome these responsible words .
at the moment , europe , in particular , is being called upon to do this .
we must be aware of this .
i therefore feel that we must have true solidarity and it must be clearly expressed .
i do not agree .
i believe that they are right .
but it remains to be seen whether we can all agree .
it has one , of course .
the question they put to us was : how will europe help us ?
will europe support us ?
that was really most difficult .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , solidarity in speech must now give way to solidarity in action .
right and proper as they are , we can and must do more .
our main priority should be to aim for the true integration of all countries into world trade .
there will be no development without trade .
but it has happened , and how and why it happened is crucial .
dialogue is the first step .
europe , above all others , has demands made of it .
such is the demand of the moment .
i would rather have not had this experience in this field , i would do anything not to have had it , but i have .
joint responsibility in dealing with terrorism is our main , most effective , political response .
they have never wanted peace .
the situation can , of course , change .
europe does not have the means .
there must be no more of this .
i have to say , i doubt it .
i know , therefore , how important it is to get both the response right and also to protect the general public as far as is possible in a democracy .
future of cohesion policy
in any case , it is clear that projects and action supported by the economic and social cohesion policy are particularly important to european citizens .
i would like to thank you , therefore , for this opportunity and thus quickly mention certain points .
my second point concerns procedures for the future .
this information , which i must give to the council , i must also , naturally , give to the european parliament .
we know that it is an important issue .
this also means that we must carry on with the structural fund policy .
too true !
this cannot be put off for ever and a day .
where are we in real terms ?
despite this , agenda 2000 decided that the cohesion fund should continue .
but it is also about a quite fundamental question : what , in the eu , does solidarity mean ?
i myself would be prepared to talk in terms of one or two , or even three , criteria .
the second point is that these reports refer to 1999 .
therefore , since we are talking about the future application of these funds , this must be taken into account in the union 's new policies in this field .
how can it be done ?
how can it be achieved and with what instruments ?
we clearly have to improve the current application of the structural funds and the cohesion fund .
we are talking today about what was to be seen over the last few years and , of course , also about the conclusions we must draw from that for the years to come .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , in view of what one member said , i believe that this is a very appropriate time to discuss economic and social cohesion .
economic and social cohesion demands that we take it into account in all our policies .
money , without it nothing we need to do can be done .
it is one of solidarity .
however , i feel that the crucial issues are different and i will list some of them .
this goes without saying .
this is a problem .
with this in mind , i would ask each one of you , however , to be fair to the commission .
i have shown transparency .
i will make a very clear and very objective point to the committee on regional policy .
i agree .
it is accepted by all member states .
all i have done , commissioner , is ask you the same question that you asked parliament .
secondly , commissioner , we have enlargement to deal with .
the debate is closed .
cohesion fund ( 1999 ) - structural funds ( 1999 )
europe must have cohesion or it will not work .
given these circumstances , we must be aware that when we talk about structural funds policy , we are not dealing with ' just another ' eu problem .
this is precisely what this report does not do .
we are dealing with funds which were established at a particular moment when our objectives involved a policy of economic and social cohesion .
we would like to make some very specific comments in relation to these two reports on the application of the funds during the years in question .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the first is the right of asylum .
that is most important .
my second point , mr president , concerns money .
thank you very much , commissioner .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
the reality is that we cannot do it even if we would like to .
more support must be given .
mr president , commissioner , i am very pleased that this report has been presented .
we are supported by women across the world .
our solidarity and support are still needed .
what can the european union do ?
first , proposals and legislation .
however , legislation is not always the only solution and there is a great deal which can be done in this area .
the question of asylum .
the debate is closed .
equal pay for work of equal value
this means that many women do not even use the legal resources available to them .
let me draw attention to three points .
women therefore have access to 10 % of all the jobs on offer .
so there certainly is a need for a change of approach .
some countries think it is good for women .
but there are many jobs where no social partners exist , that is , all service jobs .
so what can we do there ?
that is unacceptable .
that is where the government could step in , but so could the social partners .
the report we are discussing is an initiative report .
and here , the european union must continue to play a key role .
a great deal has been done , including in terms of the measures to be taken .
the commissioner and the commission are very open to such proposals and the employment guidelines for 2002 make this a priority too .
the commission is already working on this and i should like to give you one example .
the second basic point concerns the guidelines for 2002 .
the debate is closed .
the issue is one of security in working life and the organisation of work .
i have been asked why the eu should concern itself with these issues and what all this has to do with the community .
the eu has had legislation for a long time regarding health and safety at work .
what do we need to do ?
where does legislation come in ?
of course , it is possible that the commission will say that we do not need , and will not have , such legislation .
let me take an example from my own country .
well done .
i think that we should all be aware of the fact that this is a new problem .
what can we do ?
i want first of all on behalf of my group to thank the rapporteur for this report .
it seems to me therefore that it is something which the commission and the parliament should address .
however , it is not clear yet to what extent companies have implemented this legislation .
the debate is closed .
the next item is a joint debate on the following reports .
we have made progress in this area too , and the commission is being asked to propose measures to deal with this problem .
the point i want to make is this .
changes are going to have to take place to meet the requirements of this proposal .
this is a key area in which we have been successful .
however , we have not been entirely successful .
indeed , in many sectors , this is already a reality .
i wish to thank the members and the commission for the work we have carried out together .
the joint debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
this is one small part of that process .
many thanks , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
secondly , there is a lack of transparency .
i should like to list three .
many thanks , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i hope the house will follow the line that has been put forward by the committee in this report .
i know this is a difficult issue .
welcome
i hear quite a few people talking about a common european asylum policy .
that is not want we want either .
however , the amendments tabled by this parliament with regard to the commission document often lack the necessary balance .
that is why i cannot support the majority of these .
that is why we believe that the text before us today should just be the first part of the final directive .
they should be presented to us at the same time so that we can take an overall view .
this is our position and it seems very clear to me .
as the commission wanted , i believe that we finally have a good basis for discussion .
thank you for your report .
it is extremely necessary , but because it is necessary , it is also very difficult .
our objectives are the same .
i particularly welcome two provisions proposed by the commission .
that does not mean that we are in favour of a long procedure .
thank you , madam president .
i would first like to put this proposal in its proper overall context .
they need to be seen as a whole and i believe in fact that this house has always seen things in that light .
other proposals will have to be taken into consideration .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
you are absolutely right .
vote
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament approved the joint text )
i am sure you do .
i am sure you know that .
i am not in favour of this europe , mr president .
but unfortunately i have had to vote against this measure . why ?
those who voted for these provisions know full well what they are doing .
"
what would you have done ?
1 .
cohesion is a treaty objective which it is vital to implement
in reality , there is still a great deal to be done to achieve this objective .
2 .
3 .
the objective of cohesion will not end with enlargement
what we receive is too little .
europe should have much , much more for all the european citizens who need to see this europe as important and close to them .
why can i not help saying something ?
"
this report is a step in the right direction and for that reason we have voted for it .
this is not such an area .
statement by the president
( applause from the left )
( applause )
it is this that i ask of you .
agenda
secondly , the political issue .
these are the reasons why my group has proposed this change to the agenda .
madam president , i would very much like to add to what has been said .
i believe that everyone will see this as a step in the right direction .
let me first congratulate you on it .
madam president , on a point of order .
this is a very serious matter .
madam president , of course this has already been discussed at a commission meeting .
there is a serious matter .
here is a situation within the european union that has been going on for a long time .
we must do this at a local level , at a national level , and we must ensure this is done at european level .
'
i believe that the house has today shown its solidarity , which , in my view , is also essential .
in addition to this , what can we do at european level ?
what you said is important .
several things will need to be implemented .
first of all , we need resources .
we need political measures .
' never again !
' ' never again !
' never again !
there is no safety programme in place .
indeed , never again !
so what can and must we do in a situation like this ?
we will continue to offer our help and assistance .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
unfortunately , our environment ministers do not share our opinion .
but that is not enough .
so what is it about ?
the population has everything to do with this .
information is another point .
we think this is very important .
such things can , though , be only the beginning .
parliament 's amendments , however , go even further , and i cannot back most of these as a result .
i do not think so .
so , in my view , a good mean value would be a good solution .
there is a need for more research on this .
i am not going to go into that , however .
this attention must lead to specific measures .
citizens must - and that is , in fact , the most important point , in my opinion - have clear rights .
we are currently at second reading and we need to focus on the main issues , as set out by the rapporteur .
i supported his report in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and i support it again now .
i would like to mention another point .
that will be for another day as far as i am concerned .
this is a matter for local authorities and for national governments and should not be a matter for this parliament and for europe .
in this respect , we cannot accept amendment no 20 .
that is therefore no longer a point of discussion .
we have taken note of this .
the debate is closed .
that is why we have to do something about this .
what is this compromise about ?
i do not like this system .
this system should not be supported .
if so , they should think again .
it has made the investment .
but is that not what we want overall ?
after all , we are not saying that the changes have to be made now .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
and
i hope that you will agree with this line of approach .
one is that parliament has no control over this fund .
we have some experience of this in germany .
i might add that they were not voted on in committee either .
more budgetary control , more parliamentary control , means more transparency and more responsibility .
we must be clear about that .
it is in this context that the commission has to address your amendments .
so the answer is that we will have to continue to look at that particular issue .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
decision on urgent procedure
nevertheless , i should like to make a number of comments .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
we therefore need to bring some order to current practice .
this is essential .
but why is it that our citizens do not see the actions of the various institutions of the european union in a proper light , as we might expect ?
there is also a second important issue here .
so what is needed ? joint regulation ?
open coordination ?
this applies in particular to the issue of call back that we have also been discussing today .
what , precisely , can be done about this ?
you will have to address the issue of a european democracy and the position of the commission in this process .
i would like to talk about transparency for a moment .
i am very much in favour of that .
i certainly regard that as a very good proposal .
we therefore need cooperation across the institutions in order to move forward .
can people be held to account ?
that is not our idea of democracy .
he obviously does not believe in parliamentary democracy .
however , there are some things i am still not clear about .
i hope that you will be able to deal with those in your reply as well .
it certainly does that .
mr president , i have three points .
that is where we should all start .
the commission has to face this .
that is how we should approach this debate .
yet that is what we need .
( applause )
but what if it were not very good ?
that is a very welcome development .
this , then , is the commission 's position .
this , to me , is a step forward .
mr president-in-office of the council , you now have the floor .
asylum and immigration
the next item is the joint debate on asylum and immigration policy .
let me take asylum first of all .
the right to asylum is , of course , a priority for all of our countries .
our response to this issue has to be a joint one , based on solidarity .
how will this make the system better ?
in conclusion , i should like to thank my colleagues from my own and other groups for their help and support for this report and for their cooperation .
let us look at the three groups first .
and they certainly do not work well with the member states .
but they do need support .
we would then , at least , be able to support his report .
why is that ?
i have a clear answer to that : no !
so much the better .
( applause from the right )
a fundamental debate is taking place about asylum and immigration in europe .
it is about guidelines for asylum and immigration in europe .
the problem of asylum is with the procedure .
so we need to get the procedure under control .
we do not accept this .
( applause from the right )
i am not so sure .
the rapporteur took all this into consideration .
this has already been discussed here in parliament .
it is not the same .
this is no longer acceptable .
do we still have any requirements at economic level and if so , of what kind ?
does immigration have to be subject to conditions ?
i would now like to make three points .
( applause )
vote
( parliament adopted the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution )
before the final vote on the first proposal
( parliament adopted the proposal ) president .
before the final vote on the second proposal :
( parliament adopted the proposal ) president .
( parliament adopted the motion for a resolution )
before the vote :
we did not vote on them at all in committee .
( parliament adopted the motion . ) before the final vote :
i ask you to vote in favour of it .
( parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution . )
we have therefore voted against these two reports .
in fact , it has never been clear to me in what way national security interests can be different from those of the european union .
this is completely unacceptable .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
then i would like to say a word about a draft regulation which the commission has today adopted .
but it is actually true .
nothing will ever be quite the same again .
i should like to make one other point .
we understand the difficulties .
we , as europe , must do more .
i should now like to home in on this particular region , however .
we will need to do this as europe .
it is not ' them ' or ' they ' , but it is our joint responsibility to act in that region .
we must do all we can to help .
however , i would like to add one more aspect , which is at the same time a question , a question to the council , who are not here .
i would therefore like to ask the commissioner a question instead .
let us be clear about that too .
so what is - or what should be - the role of the european union ?
that is not acceptable .
next , i should like to move on to my most important point .
my concern is the political response .
and what do we do ?
that is how it must be .
so this is more than just food aid .
let me address some of the questions that have been asked .
this is not the problem .
i would go as far as to say that in general this is not the problem with our work in the humanitarian aid area .
protection was mentioned .
but this is extremely difficult .
this is the line to take .
thank you .
the debate is closed .
of course , i will answer any question which you may ask me on this subject .
might we perhaps put this experience to use ?
those are my two questions .
that was my first question .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your questions .
this is a fundamental issue .
my question is , ' how have you done it ? ' .
so where did you get that 10 % from ?
secondly , the environmental impact .
second issue .
we will have to see whether the council and parliament support it .
third issue .
question time ( commission )
part i
this is something which is yet to reach a point which i consider acceptable .
mr president , commissioner , thank you .
having said that , however , i should point out a certain number of things .
thank you for your answer .
we will move on to the second part .
thank you for your information , commissioner .
all that remains to be seen is what the government 's response will be to the commission 's move .
what will the commission 's next move be ?
just so that our citizens know where they stand .
mr president , commissioner , thank you for your efforts .
i thank the commissioner for his answer .
is that to come from the commission 's own budget ?
if you want to change that , then that 's up to you .
thank you very much , commissioner .
mr president , on a point of order .
president .
above all , i am concerned about what we are doing now .
mr president , with regard to safety standards , i refer back to what i just said .
this is what i can tell you in relation to safety regulations .
it is not the commission which has to make the assessment .
thank you very much , commissioner .
these are not my words but the words of a member of the european commission .
i should therefore like , for a moment , to come back to the result .
one can ask if the eu was fully prepared for that .
we have to find the right words to provide a solution .
why ?
for what purpose ?
and this is something that parliament cannot play down .
this is the least we could have done at this conference .
we have a responsibility to do this as well .
no , certainly not .
this is an opportunity for our european union .
so let us not allow it to happen !
let us be an example .
what , then , should have been discussed ?
and , unfortunately , this is what happened .
i think that the commission has already been working on this matter for some time .
this is a particularly important subject for the european union , i am aware of this , and what is more , i share this concern .
and that is something that i cannot accept .
what are we doing in terms of following up this conference ?
the debate is closed .
that is an aim and objective i think we would all agree with .
it is important that we finally , after five long years , bring this to a close .
in a moment i shall refer to some of the issues involved .
what about the principles ?
it will go through tomorrow .
this directive makes significant progress in three areas , namely the internal market , the transport policy and the social policy of the community .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i would like to make it clear that i support the commission 's approach in principle .
there is not only good in the world .
the european union is a major power .
we must be aware of this situation .
the council must certainly be made aware of this .
there must be a balance .
and given the high cost , we expect a contribution towards the cost of the use .
that too took up a lot of time .
let me start with the technology .
that is absolutely not the case .
if we consider the levels concerned , the first level is an open access system , which is free .
you may not have been aware of this , but that is the case .
as you can see , there is still much to do .
the debate is closed .
it is a small part of what is needed .
because , although i agree with its content , i do not believe that this is the right instrument in which to include this type of measure .
the debate is closed .
they need to be able to take all the current problems of the new economy into account .
this is an area in which only the member states have authority .
for that very reason , i hope i may be allowed to question some of it .
and how will we get there ?
do you know , commissioner ?
but the question is , what kind of a future ?
questions on a good report .
but change is important and positive .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
there is something wrong there .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
they will also have the opportunity to discuss some of the more political aspects of the euro , such as the use of the euro in the candidate countries .
in less than three months , the euro will be here .
let me say a last word on this subject .
it is therefore necessary that we act in solidarity with each other .
we now need more of europe .
we support what you have said .
( applause )
( applause )
in conclusion , mr president , i should like to make three comments on the convention .
firstly , i understand that the convention has already been adopted .
( applause from the left )
many measures will be needed in the coming months .
i agree with him .
that would certainly be one answer .
we must all work together .
would they do so today , mr president-in-office of the council ?
much has been said about air safety and security , many measures have been taken at european level .
obviously you will all say ' no ' .
people expect their governments to guarantee their safety .
they are in the best interests of us all .
europe has been there .
europe has been at war .
far too many people have too many financial interests in this matter .
let me begin with some further information about the convention .
several members raised this matter .
if it was just up to me , believe me we would go much further than proposals .
i can do no more .
several members raised the issue of security in brussels , so i will address their concern .
of course , i agree with him .
you all know my views on this .
we will get there in the end .
i think others will agree with me on this point .
we must nevertheless continue to bring it up .
this was accepted .
i heard them clearly .
we must , therefore , review our development policy again .
yesterday the commission proposed a new initiative .
what kind of presidency will the union have ?
however , there is still a certain amount of concern in this area .
the president of the united states said that the war against ' terrorism ' will last a long time .
i see these resolutions overall in a positive light .
but , now what ?
but how is it to do so ?
will enlargement continue to take place on the same terms ?
it is therefore crucial to get it right .
this is also relevant to enlargement .
they must be given their place .
that is not what i want .
i will come to a close soon .
i believe that the candidate countries must be given a place , the best possible place in this convention .
the same has happened under other circumstances .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
this is not a new thing , though .
vote
( parliament adopted the request for urgent procedure )
( parliament adopted the initiative )
( parliament adopted the initiative )
( parliament adopted the joint text )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we therefore continue to call for common european standards .
the member states take many different views on this particular point .
however , it is still a wish list .
it is time that the member states of the european union applied that convention in full .
this goes against all the international principles of basic human rights .
this being the case , i voted against the report .
we , however , do not draw that conclusion at all .
this is not our opinion either .
yet what , in the face of all this , is brussels ' policy ?
we have therefore voted against this report .
naturally i support these proposals .
for these reasons , i voted for the resolution .
welcome
( applause )
it makes it possible to implement the most appropriate budgetary policy for each set of circumstances .
ladies and gentlemen , these are the key issues i wanted to share with you .
that was the first demand .
why can they not agree to that ?
then they said : we want to put its principles fully into practice .
why not just agree to it then ?
why not agree to that ?
why can they not agree to that ?
but in reality they do not .
i believe that we will be able to turn words into actions .
this results in a lack of public and private investment .
we want reform .
this is not the right response to the situation .
i would like to stress one last point relating to the fight against terrorism and its funding .
however , that is not the issue .
i would like to note in this connection that increasing expenditure is no solution .
i say that because the european union needs both monetary stability and employment and social stability .
firstly , i would like to thank you for giving me the floor .
i am sure that this debate will continue .
this is my first point .
that cannot work .
that is our right .
and he is right .
that is not at all the case .
i do not believe it would .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i can therefore give my full support to amendments nos 2 , 3 and 4 which have been tabled here .
but what has happened since then ?
there is also a special set of problems in this context .
mr president , i would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done and also the commission on such an appropriate initiative .
we agree with you .
this process is already under way .
the process will continue next year .
i am sure that the commission and the european parliament will work together to bring us up to date .
the debate is closed .
question time ( council )
efforts are under way .
nevertheless , the whole business of taking research on to the development stage is important .
we take note of your statement , which is not a question .
that is clearly the case here .
of course , we are aware of this problem and this is why all these initiatives have been implemented .
what has the council done about this ?
thank you for your reply .
that does not answer my question .
that is a matter for the member state .
it is not for the council or the european union to decide what should happen .
it is making an impact with the citizens .
the reply of the president-in-office is clear .
madam president-in-office of the council , you have the floor if you wish .
and , in my view , it is a matter for you , the council or the commission .
this is , then , the responsibility of the member states .
does that mean that i will , at a later date , at some point receive a reply ?
thank you very much , madam president-in-office of the council .
where is that report ?
we must ask specific questions , but i accept your question and the president-in-office will answer it .
if you wish to add anything , you have the floor .
that is your own assessment , mr president .
i have accepted your question .
i have said that it seems very general , but the president-in-office will reply to it .
there is no problem .
mr president , if i may , i shall answer all three at the same time .
two other members also wanted to speak .
i have given you some information on this issue .
i thank the president-in-office for her answer .
a general meeting was held where candidate countries and , indeed , the commissioner were present .
what are your priorities here ?
but that is by the by .
that is what i said , and it is different .
you are well aware that the council 's position on turkey is very clear .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report we are about to debate has come at a crucial moment .
a great deal has already been done and there is still a great deal to do .
it also means that a national debate must be based on the stability programmes .
unfortunately , i will not be able to continue that practice today .
this is in no way a party political issue for us .
why ?
what does this mean ?
i do not think that we should play this down in today 's debate .
so the vital question is this : what should we do in that situation ?
mr president , i want to deal particularly with the issue of public expenditure , quality and employment .
so we cannot support the report in its current form .
and where will that come from if there is no significant public expenditure ?
no , it certainly is not !
i shall of course be voting against this report .
we must look to the future .
but the single currency is not an end in itself .
i wish to focus on two matters .
nevertheless , this is what we have to focus on .
mr president , i would like to make one final comment . we should not see the coordination of policies as an end in itself .
it was not a matter of content .
the debate is closed .
competition policy ( 2000 )
we welcome the progress which the commissioner has made on state aid control .
so we could go on .
the situation in europe has without a doubt become more difficult again for competition policy .
the first and most important is the impact of competition policy on consumers .
the debate is closed .
there is a lot still to do .
of course , there are real difficulties .
this will be absolutely crucial if financial services are to move forward .
this is a very good report .
i encourage the house to give it its full support when we vote on it tomorrow .
i still have myself .
mr president , i too congratulate the rapporteur on the report which he will present to us tomorrow .
i have one comment to make .
first of all the scope for national policy .
perhaps we should no longer do that so often .
we will follow that line in future proposals and negotiations .
they are points which were also raised by various members in the debate .
several of the amendments , unfortunately , are not acceptable to the commission .
that is precisely the approach which the commission , with the support of parliament , would like to continue .
the debate is closed .
internal market strategy for services
a vote will be taken on the amendments tomorrow .
now to my own report , however .
discussions in the council took a very long time .
we should not rule any instrument out .
unfortunately , things are not like that .
the commission 's overall course of action is good .
it is also important that the candidate countries should be involved as soon as possible .
finally , in order for this work to be a success , the commission must not be left alone .
therefore , this communication is extremely welcome .
again , these provisions will help .
clearly there is a lot of work to be done .
they are going to demand them from other countries .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
what is this report about ?
but there are still things that need to be done .
we should have this information there in future , too .
mr president , i want to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and thank him for his cooperation .
that is one of the most important consumer policy concerns in this sector .
that alone would not be enough and would be of no benefit .
the debate is closed .
the matter is now closed .
mr president , i do not think i will take up the whole five minutes .
i believe that of the first amendments presented by the european parliament at first reading , the other two institutions have accepted some important amendments .
i believe that a major part of the european parliament 's proposals were included .
i have to say , as rapporteur , that this is perhaps what concerns me most .
it is therefore even more important and necessary that this report is before us today . our thanks are due to the rapporteur , whose efforts have made this possible .
monitoring measures will therefore be very important .
secondly , as regards parliament , there is the rapporteur .
this was one step forward , but an important one .
i congratulate the rapporteur .
the purpose of the report is to change this situation . i fully support this objective .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is the reality !
so " appropriate " is the word , rather than " 10 % " .
i hope that this house will give me full support for this report , which i did not try to make political .
the principle is therefore now established .
what does this mean in specific terms ?
in the same way , we need a more general discussion about the environment .
at present , they are not available .
the rapporteur also points out very clearly that it is necessary to increase development aid .
and what is the eu doing ?
yet this is still the crucial issue .
this is an issue of fundamental social justice .
and we do not want that .
i therefore support the measures proposed .
policy direction is an important instrument here .
that is why the honourable member 's report is so important and fundamental .
the honourable member has provided the words in this report ; now it is time for the commission to act .
it is a problem of resources , and above all , it is a problem of political will .
mr president , others have established the need for action .
they will not say .
they just will not answer .
let us have some clear speaking in this debate .
( applause from the left )
this is a major problem .
health is fully on our agenda now , and the same is true of our own member states .
health in developing countries is , together with education , one of the six priorities for the commission for 2002 .
this is the economic framework before us .
their experience is that very little has been possible .
all this work is taking place .
i want to give some additional information here .
many issues are therefore , being discussed now .
the debate is closed .
vote
before the vote on the draft regulation
i am sure you will understand .
this is an agreement that has been reached between all the groups .
( applause )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the joint text )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the start of the vote .
are there any other colleagues who wish to say this ?
that would be in my interest as well .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
and
before the start of the vote
i hope members will support this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it is a very important matter .
this means that there is a role for the court of justice and this means that there is a role for the european parliament .
it is a serious matter that should most certainly have been discussed in parliament .
does that come from the rules of procedure , madam president ?
"
how can we support it when we do not even know how it was put together ?
moreover , what about certain general legal principles such as :
benefit of the doubt ?
we voted against this draft regulation for a number of reasons .
i voted against the resolution for several reasons .
and this is the reason why we will vote against them .
the purpose of increasing expenditure is to improve public investment and to encourage private investment ; and
paragraph 2 :
however , it does not say how that financial balance should be reached .
who should pay ?
this is clearly not the line taken in the report .
the report makes a number of good points .
this is a democracy ; it does not need violence to bring about change .
i believe that overall , a good compromise has been found .
obviously , there are reasons for this .
that must not happen .
we say and we hope that it did .
we hope they will make progress .
the joint debate is closed .
human rights
united nations world day
without that , the country cannot be considered by the european parliament as a democratic state .
commissioner , could i have your attention for a moment ?
when will something finally be done about the water problem in our region ?
when will the european community , when will the whole international community help us to actually do something together with the other countries in this region ?
they go home .
i believe that as an international community we must take our responsibility seriously .
this is why we call on the international community : to provide more support and assistance .
in this context , the eu should focus particularly on rural development and health .
instead , let us be prepared for the fact that our support will continue to be needed for many more years .
i would say that so far , so good .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we have done so and we still have not had an answer .
this is a case that has been open not only for a few months , but for a few years .
i think , nevertheless , that it is up to the european union to give a response .
i hope that the commission , too , will make our concern its own .
is it still meeting ?
even that is not clear .
we cannot continue to say one thing and mean another .
that would be unacceptable .
i agree that this is a problem but , unfortunately , not one which the commission can do anything about .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
today , the european parliament , through its vote , will decide between the reality and the directive .
mr president , i shall not speak about the subject but on the institutional issues .
that is only right and proper .
that is simply not possible !
this is one of the fundamental principles of a democracy under the rule of law .
and that is how it should be .
the fact that just a few people are to discuss the issue quickly here is therefore very wrong .
we shall not be able to support the resolution .
number one .
mr president , this is a very serious matter .
however , this is the legislation we have as our basis for action .
the debate is closed .
in practice such aid has not cost the eu anything in recent years .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it is important that all members of parliament are made aware of this .
we are talking about community matters and they should be discussed at that level .
secondly , money has to go where it is best used .
again this is a matter for the community .
parliament 's views on this matter have been made very clear to us .
we happen to agree with them but we cannot say one thing in one document and then not apply it in an area like this .
however , in practice this would only be possible when new budget guidelines are agreed in a few years ' time .
let me turn to trade .
so let me be very clear here .
this is the current position and so it will remain .
the debate is closed .
vote
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
agenda
president .
the order of business is thus established .
we shall of course take note of what you have said .
this is completely unacceptable .
thank you , madam president .
she is quite right to say that agreement has been reached with the council and it is now up to parliament to have the third reading .
thank you .
we shall look into this , as you have asked .
i shall therefore begin with the issue of air transport safety .
nevertheless , given the situation , the united states naturally decided to move forward themselves on this issue .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank you for your attention .
thank you , commissioner , for your statement .
madam president , commissioner , we have reached a serious point , a very serious point .
we cannot currently guarantee the safety of our citizens .
they are concerned and quite rightly so .
how will it ensure the safety of our citizens ?
we need to act as quickly as possible .
although it is not an opinion that i share , it is one that i respect .
this is very serious .
mr president , i would like to make a final comment .
i did not deal with specific questions , such as those that some members of parliament wanted to bring up during the debate .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
let me begin with the area of civil law .
criminal and administrative law , on the other hand , are still only at the beginning of their european development .
this was , however , not what the relevant committee wanted .
less is sometimes more .
the second problem is the development of law .
we must take account of this .
by way of example , i would say that over the last two years , five regulations in this field have already been adopted by the council , and two other proposals are under discussion .
two new legislative proposals are currently being prepared by the commission .
we will have the opportunity to discuss these issues again and to make decisions , when the time comes , on the basis of legislative proposals .
our committee was extremely clear .
we also find that people want access to resources in order to be able to understand the information they are given .
we have taken very good note and this should not happen again .
the debate is closed .
moreover , it has made a number of changes of its own .
the council adopted the same policy .
that is something that no one can want to see happen .
we support the two amendments he has tabled .
i believe it should be put through as is .
why ?
now i come to the amendments tabled .
i should like to be clear that this is not acceptable to the commission .
we believe that it would not be acceptable for the council either .
so let us agree on amendments nos 1 , 2 and 3 .
that is possible in the united states .
i believe the vote will be taken tomorrow and i hope we can now agree to amendments nos 1 , 2 and 3 and to the proposals as such .
the debate is closed
international monetary system
we should therefore view the need for financial stability as being in the public good .
the monetary fund must become more democratic .
common rules and standards should be applied on an international level .
on that point we take a completely different view .
the report points that out .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
that is the right way to go , and therefore i very much congratulate the rapporteur and hope that we will not support the amendments to an excellent report .
that has already been said .
third , we begin at home .
nevertheless , we must keep making progress in this area .
what can we do ?
how can we improve the situation ?
i can , therefore , only agree on the need to make progress .
and on these points , parliament can be sure that the commission will continue to make progress .
the debate is closed .
( applause )
i have taken note of what you have said .
decision on urgent procedure
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
information must be provided about it , and the local authorities that are to help set these things in motion must also be involved .
that is what we are voting on today .
however , support for local initiatives is required , for example , in the form of better information about what the common european employment policy is and what the objectives are .
to start with , we need to make sure the citizens of the union know what the european employment strategy is .
we must make ensure that all the member states understand that it is crucial for the social partners and civil society to be involved if this effort to increase employment is to be effective .
i hope that this approach will meet your concerns .
i have , however , taken the most positive approach possible to the amendments which you have tabled .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
in this connection , i would like to refer to the experience in my own country .
let us now get these matters implemented and not just continue to talk about them .
these are positive proposals which , as i said , we support .
this is my question .
there have been a number of compromise amendments .
it is clear that some member states will continue to have problems with certain aspects of this directive .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this report .
i am therefore particularly pleased to have the opportunity to welcome this proposal which will change things .
i am very pleased that there has at last been progress on this crucial matter .
in many other cases , the directive has not been applied .
some important amendments have again been proposed , which improve the report .
( applause from the left )
representatives of the council , we are at second reading .
therefore , the commission is not prepared to accept those amendments .
however , a number of the proposed amendments are acceptable , in full or in part , to the commission , as they will improve the text .
under these circumstances , the commission can accept amendment no 2 and the first paragraph of amendment no 12 .
the debate is closed .
employment guidelines for 2002 / joint employment report 2001
but the points have been set .
i believe , though , that dialogue between the ministers of the various member states is particularly important here .
we do not , therefore , wish to start making changes at the present stage .
i should also like to say a few words about the future .
but how ?
the situation is different now , however .
can we continue within the same framework ?
can we continue with the same approach to the employment strategy ?
the debate is closed .
amendment no 2 is crucial .
that is simply not the case , however .
however , that is how it will always be when it is a question of people and their working environment .
clearly , these could be applied in practice out in the real world .
that , i think , is wrong .
i actually agree that we should not simply consider the views of industry .
let me be clear .
it will cost jobs .
the commission cannot accept amendment no 11 for both technical and political reasons .
the debate is closed .
i want to know on what basis that decision was taken .
vote
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
reports without debate :
( parliament approved the legislative resolution )
of course every member is allowed to vote as they so wish .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
more and better jobs mean greater economic and social cohesion .
it is important that the citizens of europe are involved in decisions that are taken at a european union level .
i support progress .
i support economic development .
we must ensure that there is a balance between the protection of our environment and economic progress at all times .
i therefore voted for the report .

" " and what are you doing now ?
! "
why is this so ?
this is far from being the case .
but for whose benefit ?
2002 budget
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the committee on budgets :
who will pay for this ?
i shall , first of all , focus on what it does not say .
i would like to mention something which is in the report .
i should now like to move on to the administrative expenditure of the institutions .
there are , however , developments in some areas of the agricultural sector that still give cause for concern from the budgetary point of view .
let me take this as an opportunity to thank you again for this on behalf of the commission .
not enough has yet been done about this at european level .
as i have already mentioned , we are now in a situation in which a contribution is to be made from the european budget to the global health fund .
i would like to return to one point in particular , which you , mr president-in-office of the council , mentioned : i refer to the funds for the common foreign and security policy .
we have , though , this specific line for the common foreign and security policy .
i know we are going to need this money .
however , in the committee on budgets a completely different amendment was tabled .
i have also been asked to say a word about implementation .
i would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a few things for future reference .
in the budget procedure , we always have to deal with one demand - they say they need more money .
the consequences of this development are clear to see .
we must make changes here .
let me single out three issues .
however , this will be extremely difficult in the coming years .
we know something must be done .
i am very pleased the committee on budgets has accepted our point of view and i hope the commission does as well .
we must , though , face reality .
this is not on !
it is absolutely not on !
let me take this opportunity to thank the general rapporteur for working so well with me and my colleagues on the agriculture committee .
the committee on women 's rights is therefore very pleased that the rapporteur and the committee on budgets has accepted its proposals .
they decide who is to be the government , of course , that is not a responsibility of this parliament .
mr president , i would like to put a question to you .
therefore , you will have to answer three questions , and i end on this .
this year they have done a particularly good job under difficult circumstances .
one of the reasons for that is because , once again , we could not get into any discussions with the council ; we could not get any agreements with the council .
that is not a reference to you president-in-office !
where are we ?
we are concerned that if we hand the whole process over to the commission , it will be no better .
the commission will take the decisions instead of parliament .
this really is not what we should be doing in the budget .
we must have a policy against unemployment .
there is more .
a lot of the european parliament 's initiatives can be seen in that way .
mr president-in-office of the council , the same is true of the common foreign and security policy .
you may be sure that parliament will not let that go through .
the council and the commission must of course have a part in this process in future .
we will in future continue to point to the need for further developments here .
even there it is still possible to let some air out .
as i have said , we will support you , but we will also make demands .
these people must also know that there is to be a change in this european union . we , as a parliament , will help to bring it about .
there are other regions which really need more aid , with which we will be concerned .
we must not stand on old rights .
thank you very much for your attention .
( applause )
what are they about ?
these are some of the reasons why we do not support this budget .
mr president , first of all , i would like to thank the rapporteur as well as the rapporteur for the other institutions .
i think that they have both done an excellent job .
i would simply like to make two comments on the rapporteur 's overall strategy .
my second comment concerns the reform of the commission .
the cooperation has been really good .
we must have discussions with the commission about this .
let me now address one further point .
i would now like to focus , in the last part of my speech , on the union 's general budget .
that is good , and there is cause to thank her for this .
we have kosovo : we have to help kosovo .
and what price do we pay ?
why ?
it should have done so .
we asked a great deal , mr president , and we received a great deal in return , and this is something i welcome .
we will try to give you an answer when we can .
everything must continue .
specific aid measures are therefore needed .
in my view , the problems that remain are at the level of open coordination .
that seems extremely important to me .
it can be done another way .
but we must always hope .
where there is political will , commissioner , one can find a way , or another budget line for the future .
they simply exist .
that seems to be all that matters .
i would , though , just ask you to think again about it .
i would ask her to look at them .
this is wrong , we need to encourage new organisations in this very important field .
i thank the commissioner for her consideration .
this is essential if we are to develop a common foreign and security policy .
i will now take note of your demand for new regulations or proposals for legislation .
things like that do not happen all the time .
many thanks !
the joint debate is closed .
as you know , this decision was adopted in a very specific way .
this is what i can tell you at the moment and i would like to thank you for your cooperation in the debate on this report .
the debate is closed .
if this were to apply , the decisions could not be taken at present in the way the commission and the council have proposed .
all in all , i would nevertheless support this council proposal , with certain amendments .
to this end , the contribution of the european union is essential .
thank you very much .
thank you for your contribution , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the social partners have an important role to play .
thank you very much .
the debate is closed .
i believe that , united , we will see a decision taken on this directive soon .
then i would like to mention equal pay .
the joint amendment that is before us does not create new rights .
why stop , though , when things are going so well ?
why did the committee on women 's rights not go this far ?
what will happen if we are ?
that is why i think it is important to support this amendment .
i hope that in the end it will help women and not create additional problems for them .
nevertheless , we are now going a step further .
but that is what we expect .
we want to create a clear legal framework .
that is unfortunately not the case .
thank you .
for my second point , i should like to address the commission .
we have the result before us .
that is why i am pleased with this report .
i am also pleased that we were able to find a compromise text concerning a number of important points .
in this context the commission can accept the following amendments .
now i should like to turn to those amendments which cannot be accepted by the commission .
the debate is closed .
thank you very much .
this means that i feel especially responsible for the last four months of that year .
we need to continue to do this .
we have made some progress towards more effective management information systems .
i therefore hope that parliament in its decisions on the budget for 2002 will support us in this effort .
this is serious .
this is an important part of the reform of the commission 's financial management and control .
we cannot act alone .
the debate is closed .
i believe that the report approved by the committee on regional policy should be accepted by council and the commission .
mr president , commissioner , i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur .
i am therefore pleased with the proposal from the committee .
she has raised important questions and also taken the proposals of others into account .
i am sure that cannot be right .
this objective is essential at this time .
thank you very much .
thank you so much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thank you for your comments .
you are on your own .
that is precisely the issue i want to focus on today .
this has become even more urgent in the light of the new world situation .
our first priority must be to be united in our action .
this is a completely new development .
firstly , the fundamental aspects of our economy .
just think what would have happened if we had not had the euro !
secondly , our programme .
( applause )
i welcome the position you have taken on this , mr president-in-office of the council .
( applause )
its task will be , rather , to present a majority proposal .
( applause )
the european union can play an important role in this context .
i should like to turn to the question of the role of the council of ministers in following up on the action plan to fight terrorism .
but i have an important question around it .
i very much welcome that .
what is our objective ?
they have agreed that the fight against terrorism must continue within a united nations framework .
we want to ensure that this is done .
an example of this is cooperation in justice and home affairs .
however , the question is whether we are prepared at all to change this .
i would like to make three points in relation to this .
thank you , mr president , for giving these conclusions .
europe did everything it could do and everything it should have done .
is that what other countries can expect from a council ?
that is not at issue at all .
we have money .
we have trade .
we have the un .
we have resources in that region .
however , we must take that political direction .
in my opinion , we should draw attention to this for a change .
we will get into serious difficulties if this principle is not accepted .
of course this house must have compromise resolutions and must , so far as possible , be united .
the creation of a european area of justice is the best contribution the union could offer at this time .
there is just one proposal approved by the council which may be of use today .
i welcome this .
secondly , i should like to comment on cooperation in the field of internal security .
what is the european union 's role ?
is a single foreign and security policy possible ?
we also , however , need an instrument at home .
each member state had its own opinion on the matter .
for our role is different from that of the united states .
for i believe that it is up to the european union , especially the european union , to take an initiative in this respect .
but when will this come about ?
the convention is a fact .
( applause )
( applause )
finally , one last point on the subject of the convention .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
thank you for your comment .
we will certainly take note of this .
vote
we are not , though , voting in favour of the amendments that have been tabled after the compromise and with which we do not agree .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
thank you .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
council reform
i shall mention just a few .
there was also a call to improve coordination of european policy within member states .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , certain measures were , for example , not completely implemented .
obviously , this must be shown by the member states governments as well as by the institutions themselves .
thank you .
we need , then , a new general affairs council .
things must change !
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
that would also help the reform .
transparency is one such issue .
for us , transparency in the eu 's work is important when it comes to all the institutions .
that is not acceptable .
the legislation must be a matter for public debate .
the council has to understand this .
we want the general affairs council to do its business .
we would like the presidency for the time being to do its business and we also want the commission to do its business .
we respect , and must respect , the three institutions and the role that they have to play .
i therefore think that the vote on this report is a great moment for parliament .
i would say , as a matter of fact , that this is the fundamental issue .
they already have enough to do with the common foreign and security policy .
effective political action cannot change its priorities every six months .
i would be pleased if it achieved that objective at least .
and quite rightly so . however , it is not enough .
i should like to comment on three points in the report which i consider extremely important .
changes must be made here .
what is that ?
that is how the council comes across to the public .
it is about time !
the debate is closed .
the european commission action plan in this area was approved by the general affairs council last may .
as you also know , the member states did not adopt our proposals .
we shall do everything we can in the following days to improve this situation .
we also know , however , that trade on its own is not enough .
why ?
secondly , environmental standards .
his task will certainly be a difficult one .
like you , i hope that we will be able to achieve more in this respect in the future .
i hope that we will make progress there .
here , too , we need your support , madam president-in-office of the council .
we have always had this support from the commission .
there will indeed be some of that .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
international trade
we propose going further , however .
i should like to point this out once more here .
we support the report and will vote for the motion , but we feel that this must only be the start of a process of change .
justice must be done and must be seen to be done .
mr president , international trade is of central importance if conditions for growth and development are to be created throughout our world .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we shall lead the way and we shall continue to work to achieve the objectives i have mentioned .
but i want to stress one or two points he made .
we need to work towards both objectives .
however , we do not agree with the fundamental aspects of his report and , for this reason , we cannot support it with our vote .
thank you very much .
thank you .
the progress achieved in the common foreign and security policy during the last few years has been based on the treaty of amsterdam .
there is more cause for this than ever before .
let us give these people something to work on .
i am not going to comment on this point .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
turkey
the next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
it is a very good report .
there are a number of hard points , however , which we need to discuss with turkey , and certainly there is still a need to discuss the issue of human rights , in particular .
i should also , however , like to address two points , which continue to be crucial for relations between the european union and turkey .
so there is no problem .
i think we should be clear , however .
it will be good for turkey , but it will also be good for ourselves .
i would answer , no .
of course , the move which turkey has to make is a difficult one .
that is a fact .
however , turkey still has a long way to go .
first , however , i should like to thank our rapporteur .
now to the points on which i should like to comment .
naturally , from our point of view , they are just a beginning .
i think that a great deal of work is still needed on this within turkey .
i should like to encourage turkey to continue with the economic reforms agreed with the international monetary fund .
i welcome the european parliament 's position on the programme of financial assistance .
the proposed amendments are acceptable to us .
the debate is closed .
the european commission would like to change this .
the debate is closed .
finally , i wish to give thanks once again for the cooperation of the commission and of the council .
the debate is closed .
accession to the wto
the next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
the eu does not need to do very much .
what conclusions do i draw , then ?
i do not draw the conclusion that we must say ' no ' .
mr president , my thanks to the commissioner for the work which he has carried out .
the debate is closed .
you have been kind enough to point out that the european parliament has always supported your action and your people .
vote
however , i would like to ask you to put one other amendment to the vote .
following the vote
we are now voting in favour of this paragraph , which is not how we voted on the budget .
the fact is , however , that the vote has been taken .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it says :
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
in other words , it would be " a commitment " to do this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
there seems not to be .
general budget for 2002
thank you very much , mr president .
for these reasons , we cannot support either the report or the 2002 draft budget .
unfortunately time does not allow me to do so .
we need a basis in law , and the commission must create it very quickly .
. i have voted against the report on turkey .
to date we have still not found a european people .
it is for these reasons that we did not vote in favour of this report .
this is why we have voted against this motion for a resolution .
we are europe !
i support him in this .
i have , of course , voted for this report , mr president , on democracy in international trade , but i should like to do more .
i support the position it has taken in this respect .
it is a social and regional measure that we could do with .
there is money there .
i would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very hard work on this difficult report .
so , it makes good economic sense to get the balance right now .
during the debate , i tabled a number of amendments .
the first one is that this is especially important for the regions - absolutely vital for large regions .
i would ask the commission , in its debate with council , to make the necessary effort to give the sector what it needs .
mr president , first of all i would like to welcome the proposal .
i also take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report on this very important subject .
we have to ask ourselves how best we can support them .
i ask this house for its support .
so i do not really think this amendment is necessary .
i cannot therefore agree to those amendments .
i shall at any rate put such a proposal before the council .
finally , i would like to thank you again for the report and the amendments .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
these are priority projects .
but the financial resources must also be made available if the measures in question are to be taken .
a number of things have been mentioned .
this , too , is a matter for the individual countries to act on .
i should like the commissioner to take note of this point , because i am giving him very practical proposals .
not a thing .
thank you .
for my part , i feel we are still far from doing so .
everyone must see to it in the areas for which he or she is responsible .
there is a procedure for that .
we therefore have the answer to the question .
thank you very much , commissioner .
we are all aware that some of these countries do not have the necessary technical means to do so .
employment and economic and social cohesion in europe are fundamental political principles of our union .
of course .
of course not .
those who say that the community does not help the fisheries sector of developing countries are wrong .
naturally , this approach also goes for the actions of the united europe in its relations with other countries , in particular the developing countries .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we hope it will be acceptable to them .
from our point of view , it is not just important that the objectives of the common fisheries policy be achieved , though that is indeed important .
it is a crime against everything we are trying to achieve .
that is a central part of the european parliament 's demands .
that is what this is about .
that is why we are not prepared to accept these four amendments .
at some point we are going to have to decide which of these two things is to have priority .
we have already discussed this point in connection with the previous agenda item .
the debate is closed .
that is the eu 's responsibility .
as you know , this agreement is a very important agreement for us .
the debate is closed .
we are in favour of development cooperation and budgetary transparency .
i am also pleased that you are able to adopt the draft .
the debate is closed .
vote
i hope that we will have the opportunity to work together in order to change this situation as quickly as possible .
are there any comments ?
we have as yet received no reply .
as far as i know , this has not yet been done .
( the minutes of the previous sitting were approved )
order of business
of course !
i am simply giving you this information so that you are aware .
i think that we must respect members .
president .
of course .
i hope we can do that .
to date , i have received no such response .
madam president , on a point of order .
there are not that many and i therefore believe that we can bring this to a good conclusion here as well .
public confidence , which is very much needed , will also increase as a result .
i also accept what she has said on the amendments .
this is extremely important if we are to bring this regulation into force .
mr president , what is transparency ?
this parliament does not yet , unfortunately , have the majority required for this .
we must all be aware that there can be no democracy without transparency .
i hope that will be accepted .
the problem is everything that is not included .
unfortunately , he is not here , but there was not going to be much to say about transparency .
however we will review it in a few years in the light of experience .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i have the report right here .
this was not in fact the case at the start of this parliamentary term .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
and
rapporteur .
so the report does not concern just terrorism but these other matters too .
internal security services , in particular , have an important role to play here .
is that so ?
are you from the council ?
we do not know !
any comment of this nature that you wish to make should be made through the presidency .
they are also aware of this need .
we believe that this is a very positive approach .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
so far , so good .
it is crucial that we make the area of justice and security in europe a reality .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we have already voted once on this report .
i will therefore be speaking only about that .
i think that , if we are talking in terms of data protection , we have to support the commission 's proposal .
why ?
it is not true .
that is another reason why i believe it should not be done .
i fully agree .
unfortunately that is no longer true .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we lack the resources to do this .
i also think that we should , for example , consider structural funds .
that , then , is possible .
there is a lot more that i could say .
that is what i mean when i say it has come just when it is needed .
and i would like to stress two other aspects of this report .
i shall therefore stress the opportunities that this report could provide in this area .
mr president , i , too , would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
that is why this is so urgent .
there is a need for more than just organisation .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
protection of animals during transport
that situation is simply unacceptable , and it must be brought to an end now .
there is no good reason for doing this .
mr president , i welcome this report and would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is a report on a commission report on the implementation of the directive concerning the protection of animals during transport .
there are a number of points i would like to make , but time is too short .
ladies and gentlemen of the council and of the commission , it is high time that action were taken .
there is , however , no control over the implementation of these .
that is , however , not the case .
this report makes its contribution to that and i ask for it to be supported across this house .
this is not the kind of europe we want !
i wish to work with them rather than against them and hope that you share this view .
i would now like to turn to the issue of resources .
i fully agree .
member states must make the effort and provide the resources to ensure better implementation .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
decision on urgent procedure
what are we going to do then ?
i understand the problems the fishing community has , but we need to be more responsible .
mr president , i would simply like to say that the committee on budgets has taken no decision in this field .
we are talking about social measures .
that is why we support the request for urgent procedure .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
mr president , there is no point in talking about old money or new money when there is no money !
i therefore ask you to vote for this request for urgent procedure .
we will , of course , come back to this several times during the overall budget process .
so i ask you to vote for the request for urgent procedure .
mr president , on a point of order .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
we support the commission 's request for urgent procedure .
we nevertheless need a little more time .
to begin with , a proper discussion is needed in the committee on budgets .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure ) president .
i will come back to this specific problem at the end of my speech .
enlargement will bring about changes in the way the council , the commission and the court of justice will work .
let me finally add one little word .
( applause )
one case in point is the way in which the monitoring regulation for the structural funds has been implemented .
has the commission , then , made too few changes in 2000 in order to improve financial management ?
there is much to do , but much has already been achieved .
so once again , many thanks .
i do not want any money from the european union ' .
let us be clear .
there is a large area where the commission has joint responsibility with the member states , particularly in the agricultural sector and the structural funds .
in the structural funds , we see problems in the application of regulations at every level .
that has not been done to date .
mr president , what can i say in two minutes ?
can we draw clear conclusions from it ?
no , not really .
however , this is still not enough .
it cannot be said often enough .
the agricultural and structural funds are what cause us problems .
we can perhaps do that in this case , but certainly not outside this area .
we wish you all the very best for the future .
thank you for your cooperation .
i wish you every success in that .
that is going too far .
that is why i am voting against this .
i certainly cannot vote for that .
mr president , i wish to congratulate and thank the rapporteur .
mr president , on behalf of the commission , i welcome very much the agreement which has been reached by parliament and the council .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this too is a very important report .
what is it about ?
the commission , the parliament and the council have been trying for many years to achieve joint legislation , particularly in the field of consumer protection .
there are many reasons why this situation has come about .
we should welcome that opportunity .
that is one point .
my final point concerns national regulations .
that will be very difficult .
the european parliament 's proposal for an action plan is particularly relevant in this context .
what is that ?
the debate is closed .
there are some very good projects in which the european union is involved .
in fact , everyone did take the appropriate action , and we should welcome this .
this is extremely serious .
and i do not believe that the commission and the member states are doing what they should be doing in this area .
the debate is closed .
services of general interest in europe
why are we concerned with this area ?
what general interest services come under eu law ?
this is particularly relevant to general interest services at regional and local level .
i also think that all levels of the european union must be involved .
above all , though , it should provide legal security for those who provide services of general interest .
and there can be no other approach .
in the light of the european parliament 's resolution , the commission will look at the subject again .
vote
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i cannot do anything about it either .
since we live in an internal market it is only right and proper that there should be some cooperation and coordination between the member states .
this is all legal however .
' i asked her .
the problem is everything that is not included .
does this mean , then , that , at last , no one will know how old we are ?
we do not support these amendments .
might it be you , mr president ?
we did not vote against this report as we support some of its proposals .
i hope that we will soon do something to improve this situation as well .
that is why we have approved the report .
the treaty , however , does not give it any right to do this .
that is why we shall be voting against the report .
there is , in principle , nothing new about what we are discussing today .
competition is also really needed in this industry .
the rapporteur is , in my view quite right to question this procedure .
that is our common objective .
we now have to deal with the question of how best to go in that direction .
what , then , is the position ?
that is the objective we have set .
that is what we are doing .
i have several reasons for this view .
many thanks , mr president .
for us , it is about safety .
we have to ask ourselves : why was local public transport created ?
however , let us take this first step together .
this is for the good of the people of europe .
we cannot therefore accept this amendment either .
in legal terms , there is no fundamental problem in relation to the principle that public authorities should decide to provide the transport service themselves .
the initiative states that .
we are talking about significant transport markets .
the debate is closed .
for if we cannot work out a clear position at first reading stage , the council then has the last word .
that being the case , we , as parliament , must give a clear lead tomorrow .
i would like to make several things clear : firstly , this is a good proposed directive by the commission .
but with regard to state aid , it seems clear that this directive is not the right place to discuss this issue .
why ?
so that is the first problem .
thank you .
of course there are interests which do not like these proposals .
i would like to make several points :
they should , in my opinion , be considered as partners in their own right , with a view to sustainable development .
the proposals made to date will not , in my opinion , take us any further towards these essential objectives .
competition is one thing .
first of all , there is the scope of the directive .
i will not support these amendments .
however , that too has , of course , been mentioned in the report .
now we have a good opportunity to do a favour to european employment and sustainable development .
this is not always the case at the moment .
however , there are issues that we cannot accept , for various different reasons , and you must understand this , ladies and gentlemen .
in this regard also , parliament 's relevant committee supported our proposal .
enlargement
the next item is the commission communication on enlargement .
why is this so ?
we must therefore make every effort to give the citizens in today 's and tomorrow 's member states all the information about enlargement .
these countries must not be made to feel that they are being left behind .
can you say something more about that ?
these problems were then taken into legislative account , so that we have no problems with community law .
madam president , i would like to put three short questions .
our response is quite clear .
there are positive things in it .
in this respect , relations between us and turkey were never before as close as they are now .
that is the good i have to report .
we have already discussed this in another context .
madam president , i have three questions .
i believe that this is not quite clear to all areas of all our institutions .
the second question i would like to put is this .
as you have expressed it , but i believe it needs to be expressed even more clearly : that is the assessment of today .
whether it will actually come to that , i do not know .
madam president , on a point of order .
this is not in the interests of parliament .
you are well aware that that is not my way of doing things .
you know that , when this is not the case , those members call us to task and they are quite right to do so .
mr president , on a point of order .
i am sure those who were not able to speak were very pleased to hear the commissioner 's comments .
i should like to point out that four of our colleagues here today asked three questions .
question time ( commission )
part i
thank you , commissioner , for the information which you have given us .
this is a very serious matter .
but can you not do something ?
thank you for your attention .
thank you for your reply , commissioner .
i understand the concerns of the honourable member .
i also have three children .
the scientific committee is also concerned .
unfortunately , i cannot say any more for the moment about the state of progress .
another point is research .
- i fully agree with what the honourable member has said .
i can only encourage him or her to do so .
that is why i tabled the question .
i will make two comments .
clearly the commission has taken action with regard to this issue .
i believe we can find a good way of dealing with this issue .
mr president , i believe there has been positive development since our last dialogue here in parliament on this issue .
that was my question .
this type of issue could not , therefore , be discussed at a justice and home affairs council on the basis of a commission proposal .
there are three main points in the green paper .
thank you again .
i believe that we should also express that in a positive way .
there are other areas as well .
the debate on the green paper is still open .
i hope to have further opportunities to debate this idea with you .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
parliament 's committee on industry , external trade , research and energy has adopted this report by a large majority .
what is crucial is the amount of risk involved .
but that was a few months ago .
all these concerns need to be taken into account .
the following points in the report are especially important to our group .
our group is pleased with the committee 's proposals .
first of all , the industry 's responsibility .
that is why a change is needed .
in that way , a better world can be created .
i cannot understand it .
that is not , however , going to happen .
they could be at risk .
i should like to mention a few essential points .
so we will have to look into that .
i really do hope that it will be adopted tomorrow .
however , we must balance these requirements .
that is a fact .
that obviously has to change .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i found the commission document very good .
i would like to hope that the commission and the council will find their efforts supported by parliament 's opinion .
mr president , water is the number one food .
the basic price must also take social aspects into account , for access to water must be possible for the less well off in society .
one important area in which there is a need for action is that of agriculture .
and we will be voting against these amendments .
on the other hand , the member states must set a number of objectives for themselves to ensure the proper management of water .
the member states are free to come to their own decisions .
working parties , including a working party on economic issues , have already been set up .
these working parties are to develop implementation guidelines .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
ladies and gentlemen , it is clearly time for a change .
it is possible .
there should be nothing to prevent member states from making progress .
i simply think that we must first discuss what has actually been done by the member states .
did we rightly see how things would turn out today ?
i do not believe so .
there are a lot of other points i would like to make .
my question is whether this is to do with a new strategy .
that did not happen .
i think this is necessary , but things must be done in the right order .
it is important for us to take this major initiative , but we must do it in the right way and at the right time .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there are four points i would like to address .
the commission is not , however , in a position to accept the other amendments tabled for the following reasons .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i would now like to refer to the second point .
i , along with many other colleagues , am concerned about that different approach .
there is no doubt about that .
( the minutes of the previous sitting were approved )
the next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
we might or we might not .
agriculture is also more involved .
the budget is also of major importance in my opinion .
that is why i believe our amendments are excellent .
i come to international activities , because the research framework programme must look outside the eu as well .
it will be available in any case .
i believe that he did everything he could have done .
from what i have heard , i think all the political groups will reach a compromise on these points .
it will also use scientific resources .
that must be the basic principle .
they aim to prevent this .
two points cause me concern .
it is not their priority .
this again is completely unacceptable to our citizens .
the third major issue is who is to benefit from funding .
mr president , i will start by saying something about money .
that , though , is how things are these days .
this is an opportunity for the european union to do something for the security of europe and of the world .
it is only right and proper , in my view , for us to increase the available resources in this area .
the human rights of the one are not quite the same as the human rights of the other .
that is what the law says in most of our member states .
it is a time for great words , and great words are needed .
i would also like to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the cooperation with the commission .
we will have a good programme , but the work is only just beginning .
what are we going to do with all these objectives set out on paper ?
that is the first point .
after the framework programme means before the next framework programme , but , above all , it means during implementation .
thank you very much . i look forward to further years of cooperation .
mr president , i am in favour of research .
i should like to focus on the need for research in the social sector .
the committee on the environment and the committee on transport also expressed themselves in favour of a change of this nature .
clearly , if we accept amendments to content in certain areas we must , of course , fund them .
i shall now refer to management .
we have taken the initiative with the new instruments .
that is our next task .
in conclusion , i should like to thank parliament .
thank you for your work and for your contribution .
the debate is closed .
commissioner .
i shall certainly do my best .
it has a right to do this , but europe has values and interests that are not always the same as those of the united states .
we do not agree upon certain , very specific , issues , but we will deal with these when the time is right .
) .
i would be hard put to vote in favour of this report .
in particular i want to state two points .
welcome
i very much hope , too , that the commission will adopt the amendments proposed by this house .
this is the issue today .
vote
the next item is the vote .
procedure without debate :
before the vote on the draft legislative resolution :
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
president .
that is my question , as we have agreed that the commission must put forward appropriate proposals .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before the vote :
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
president .
we can therefore vote on it , and i vote in its favour .
thank you .
at least i am clear now .
mr president , this amendment is about technology assessment .
that is very clear .
if those who tabled the amendment agree , i can accept the addition to the text .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
president .
the draft report presented to us is unacceptable in its current form .
as these amendments have not been adopted , i voted against the report .
i have several reasons for voting against this report .
this is not the case , so we are voting against this text .
' you will ask , mr president .
so how should we carry out scientific research in europe ?
we should decide to have a single european research fund .
international situation
the second strategy line is the central role of the un .
i welcome your comments , madam president-in-office of the council .
what we now need , and i agree with the president-in-office of the council on this point , is action from the united nations .
we call on you to take this action .
if you do so , you can be sure of our support .
that is my first point .
that must be our response .
but it is there .
i have two final comments .
colleagues have referred to the european security and defence policy .
i should now like to turn to the humanitarian aspect .
if so , what are they ?
but what justice are we talking about ?
what balance are we talking about ?
no , enough of that !
things are not like that .
that is the only solution that can guarantee the protection and respect for the rights of women and all human rights .
the integration of women is also a first step towards democracy .
we must , of course , focus on many other criteria .
we are making sure that we take action here .
therefore i cannot give it .
we need to act as a community .
the debate is closed .
as has been said , the compromise has not been accepted .
has the council considered this ?
i have tabled an amendment for tomorrow 's vote .
i think that we should adopt it and that the european union should include this issue in the debate .
does the commission think this should be considered in europe as well ?
certain safety standards in these areas must be set out at european level in response to this type of terrorism .
mr president , commissioner , madam minister , nothing has been said in this debate which i cannot support .
the third problem is the most crucial .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it is unacceptable that we , as a parliament , do not have access to the same information as the council .
i very much hope that the commission will answer these questions .
that would be an investment for the future .
questions have been raised as to whether that is acceptable .
what have we done so far ?
what does the european parliament want to do ?
nor , indeed , does it help the environment .
'
secondly , there is the information to be made available to the member states and also to third parties through member states .
let us hope that in this case that is true .
any further negotiations are , as far as the commission is concerned , not in order .
as far as the position of one member state is concerned , the commission has nothing further to add .
) mr president , my speech concerns a matter of procedure .
we must give them the floor .
question time ( council )
the president-in-office of the council does not consider it appropriate to reply to the following question .
it is up to the president-in-office of the council .
but i asked you a second question , madam president-in-office of the council .
i should like to thank the president-in-office of the council for her extremely clear reply to my question .
i thank the president-in-office of the council for his reply .
therefore this is a specific answer to one of the specific questions that i was asked as a result .
as they deal with the same subject , questions no 10 and 11 will be taken together .
mr president , madam president-in-office of the council , thank you very much for your reply .
this obviously applies to all member states .
that goes without saying .
i thank the president-in-office of the council for her reply .
what new action can now be taken to encourage and achieve this objective ?
i shall , however , take note of the fact that you would like the council to bring up this matter .
mr president , on a point of order .
i shall take note of the points that you have put forward , but i stand by the answer that i have given .
perhaps they can find it out now .
mr president , on a point of order .
i would thank the council of ministers for its answer .
madam president-in-office of the council , i would say that this is a question of an almost cultural nature .
i will now turn my attention to the amendments .
this issue is different .
that is why this commission proposal and the report are needed .
that is also why this report is being tabled here .
it is therefore important to avoid this situation .
we have tabled an amendment in this connection .
other colleagues , too , have referred to this matter .
we need to think of them .
i hope that there is not a majority in favour of the amendments concerned .
there is one concern i have , and i should like to ask the commissioner a question in that connection .
after all , the saying ' where there is a will , there is a way ' also applies to the bank sector .
that is an important fact .
we can thus accept that amendment .
many thanks , mr president .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
, rapporteur .
how do we know it will ?
however , in conclusion it has to be said that the directive cannot remain as it is .
in its opinion , the committee on legal affairs and the internal market also made a number of comments .
however , this is not an issue for our committee .
the second point concerns article 3 ( 1 ) .
we believe that this is wrong .
for that reason , we believe it is a considered proposal .
is that what we want to achieve ?
i also think we should ask ourselves what the candidate countries have to say about this proposal for a directive ?
mr president , i would like to thank the commission for this proposal .
the point of view of his committee is based on the legal state of affairs .
well , i have some here .
mr president , commissioner , you have just shown us an example .
but the form in this respect is important .
that is the commission 's opinion too .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
but i stress that we have not done what we should have .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this would lead to better implementation of the specific measure .
i would also like to congratulate all the members of the committee on fisheries for the work they have done .
i therefore congratulate them .
as a community of values we must not allow this .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
many thanks .
thank you !
are there any other comments on the minutes ?
are there any other comments about the minutes ?
( the minutes were approved ) .
what has been the council 's response to all this so far ?
we must not allow such a situation to continue within the european union .
the president-in-office of the council has set out the specific problems and the need for a direct european policy and agreement at european level very clearly .
i will not go over them again ; instead i shall focus a little longer on the question of the social crisis .
we in this parliament want action - and we want it now .
we need action now .
and what did we do ?
that is not enough .
we need direct action now .
finally , on the subject of the united states , let us be clear among ourselves .
secondly , the cause .
people no longer want this kind of europe .
the results of other european companies are giving cause for concern .
one thing is clear to me .
we must adopt a european approach .
i am in favour of a european approach . we can discuss and comment on the content of that approach later .
i agree with the key proposals included in the compromise resolutions that are before us today .
this cannot work .
we have to take that into account .
finally , there are four things i would ask the commission and the council to address .
there is an urgent need for the reform of the competition rules .
that may well create more jobs .
i have two specific questions that i wish to ask the president-in-office of the council .
that is unacceptable .
that is point one .
the commission has made a very good effort .
the first thing the council should allow the commission to do is to talk with the united states on its own .
if that is not done , other things should not be discussed either .
what has it done ?
of course not .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this action programme is a very serious and important step forward for the european union .
so , within the framework of this joint decision to work together , three things have happened .
secondly , the social protection committee and the european commission are working together to find a joint policy framework , again for the first time .
the debate is closed .
madam president , on a point of order .
i should like to say to this house that we as members of this parliament also have a responsibility .
vote
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that is the first step .
i agree , and this is why i was giving the floor to the commission .
( applause )
the rule is clear .
( parliament decided to refer the matter back to the committee responsible )
before the vote
"
madam president , is it clear that the vote is only on the legislative part of the proposal and not on the budgetary part ?
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote
we shall , therefore , ensure that everything is put right .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote
( the house decided to continue voting )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote on paragraph 2
' there has been no change ' he said .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
does that mean that there is not going to be a debate on the wto ?
we must have the opportunity for members from every member state to be able to vote on these reports and on these important amendments .
obviously this will no longer be necessary .
i am very pleased that our house is finally making a statement on an issue as important as this .
to what extent is the nuclear risk acceptable ?
we are voting against the motion for a resolution .
i hope we will continue the discussion on water , as so many of our citizens are very concerned with this issue .
i welcome , in particular , the following points :
there is nothing that can be done about this , for that is how it is in this house .
who would like to speak out in favour ?
i would therefore like to support the request .
so the commission will certainly make a statement to parliament on the wto , but i cannot say when that will be .
now i will move on to my speech on this report .
i would like to thank you for your contribution .
you will hear in due course when this will take place .
the debate is now closed .
i thank you .
thank you very much .
new european labour markets
it is an important report and it seems that we are doing the right thing .
it is not necessary to reach a vote at all cost today . that is why we support this request .
i would now put the request to the vote .
however , the debate has thus been held over until the next time .
the european commission has also taken new initiatives .
thank you very much , commissioner .
human rights
my question to the commission is : what can the european union do ?
the european union must support this .
this is a new sector for the community , which has come under military cooperation in the past .
thank you very much commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
i would like to hear from the commission what proposals it has to deal with this .
it has done nothing to meet the needs of the people or ensure their safety .
members of this house have raised two main issues .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
much has been achieved .
why ?
this is , therefore , an issue to which states must pay serious attention .
we support the resolution that has been tabled .
however , we believe that the very fact that this first conference was held at all is an important step .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
having said that , i thank the commission for their cooperation on my report and all the other members of the european parliament 's committee on employment and social affairs .
i believe that is one of the main reasons why we do not have any new amendments today .
all eu citizens should have equal rights .
" !
this must change .
we still have much to do , however .
we need to move from principle to practice .
they are policies based on fundamental human and civil rights .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
vote
that is the end of voting time .
order of business
with regard to the agenda , i have two changes to propose .
the order of business is thus established .
future of the european union
the next item is the joint debate on :
we are pleased to have you here and i shall now give you the floor .
i shall now turn to the european security and defence policy .
these are my comments on the european security and defence policy .
in 2002 , the commission will make proposals to the council concerning agriculture , cohesion policy and the budget of the union .
i should now like to say a few words about terrorism .
that report will also look to the future .
this issue will be discussed on the first day of the european council .
( applause )
however , let us look at these concerns as well .
( applause )
we encourage the commission and the council to keep to the course they have set .
( applause )
let me make another comment on the convention .
( applause )
let me return to a number of issues .
that is the real task .
i very much doubt it .
therefore , your responsibility , mr president-in-office of the council , is great indeed .
this is not true .
it is an instrument .
you must give the convention all it needs to be a success .
this can only be the intergovernmental conference .
we in this parliament want to be fully involved in this development .
work for all is the objective .
we want a strategy for more and better jobs .
it is absolutely vital that we achieve this objective .
i think that would be a very good idea .
i am pleased with the resolutions before us .
only then will we know whether they want to be a part of it and whether the project can ever work .
i could not agree with you more about that .
this is your responsibility now as european council , and this is the decision you must make : to reduce your powers .
people cannot understand this and accept this even less .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i will just mention five points in the short time available to me .
i know that on one point i stand quite alone , although i am in the right .
a great deal will need to be done about this in the coming years .
i said this is an opportunity , but it is not a guarantee .
we must fight to make the necessary changes come about through the convention .
that is something people cannot do much about .
the intergovernmental model is out of date .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there is no democracy without a parliament .
i doubt it .
thank you very much , mr president .
as is the convention .
i could also put that another way .
i would like to go over the various questions that were put to me concerning enlargement .
i would like to make something clear .
these are my comments on enlargement .
i am not against this at all , but we must keep a sense of balance .
the convention can take up any issue , including european security and defence policy .
i believe that the time period between the convention and the intergovernmental conference must be six months .
of course , i am in favour of transparency in the council 's work .
the debate needs to take place .
this convention , let us say it again so that it is clear , will not take any decision .
what do we want to do together ?
if we want to go further , do we want to go all together or do just a few of us want to go ?
and how ?
we should be open to the debate that will take place during that time in civil society .
the debate is closed .
this cannot be allowed to go on for another day .
thank you .
but the future of europe will be nothing if our people do not support us .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i wish you a successful debate .
i hope , though , that they will go much further yet .
i will not go back over the objectives of each of the instruments , or not much .
you know them well enough .
the council agreed to work on the basis of two proposals .
this is the situation with regard to the crime of terrorism itself .
that said , we need to move one step at a time .
just go back to parliament 's proposal , when , i believe , the position we took up was a good one .
today , we are taking a large step forward .
i do not feel this is fair .
thank you , madam president .
however , i think that there is an opportunity here .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is also the least citizens can expect from us .
we are , of course , aware that we have a problem .
thank you , mr president .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
it would have been a good thing if we had already had this green paper together with the proposal for a directive .
as has already been said , we welcome the commission 's proposal , but call for an effective instrument , that is to say , a regulation rather than a directive .
why ?
i ask you to adopt my report , on which no amendments have been tabled .
that is not what we have a commission for .
the committee on budgetary control has tabled many amendments that were voted on in the committee .
that , too , requires an amendment to the treaty .
in our opinion , there is no legal basis for some of the other amendments , either .
it is really more a question here of the strategy to be adopted .
above all , we must look at what has been the result of the reports , what measures have been taken .
we do not have that information available and will not have it available so quickly .
you have mentioned this .
however , there is a problem .
this is a real problem .
the joint debate is closed .
i have a problem .
that is something i want the rapporteur to think about .
i used to be an environment minister in the country i know best .
let me turn to some other amendments .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
here is an opportunity for action .
the report has raised a number of more general concerns .
need i say more ?
that was not on a point of order !
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following four reports :
when one or two months ago the commission presented its proposal for the first time , there was some doubt .
perhaps i shall not need all this time .
democracy , too , is making progress .
a lot remains to be done , however .
that is something we have no problems with at all .
economic growth has not been particularly good .
i believe there are a number of specific reasons for this success .
i do not know when you will be so effective again next time .
in this respect i am sure you will not be able to give us an answer today .
there are a number of conditions , as honourable members will know .
it is very important that parliament should make sure from time to time that we actually know what we are doing .
that is also good to hear .
i did it !
that is certainly the case .
we do not , therefore , feel that it makes much sense to debate that today .
the debate is closed .
thank you , mr president , on behalf of the committee on development and cooperation .
in our view , the additional nature of the contribution to the fund is a key issue .
do these people not matter to us ?
there is no interest .
what is the aim of this fund ?
these are the questions we must ask .
we still have to discuss the level of funding .
the debate is closed .
people are right to be concerned .
there is nothing more to be said .
each needs the other .
only if certain amendments are adopted in the final report shall we be able to offer our support .
human life is not created by third parties .
that was the whole point of the committee that we created last year .
i agree with you .
mr president , much attention has been given to the matter we are working on today .
we must set standards here .
sometimes we simply do not see it .
it cannot be allowed .
mr president , today 's debate is an extremely important one .
in fact , what we are discussing is nothing less than life itself .
our view is clear .
what is the point of scientific research ?
i would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report on a difficult subject .
what is the real issue here ?
let me be quite clear .
this ban must apply for both private and public research .
no , it is not acceptable .
we must decide .
it is high time we did .
i shall deal with them in the order in which they have been mentioned .
there is no doubt that case law will develop .
with this in mind , i can only support the report .
vote
( parliament adopted the commission proposal )
therefore , the commission cannot support amendment nos 1 , 2 and 3 .
as for amendment no 3 , we are against it .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
"
it is therefore completely wrong to return the report to committee .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
regarding amendment no 4
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
"
thank you very much , madam president .
i fully understand what you are saying .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
both amendments will be put to the vote .
madam president , there is really no need for me to speak now .
so the amendment we accepted goes further .
regarding amendment no 2
there is a practical reason for this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
firstly , this amendment is tabled not by the group but by myself , as rapporteur .
' .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we have , therefore , voted against this report .
'
why did i vote against it ?
the council and the commission are not doing enough , if anything at all .
that is why i will vote against this report .
it does nothing of the kind .
they call for a positive list . this is also in line with the council 's current view .
1 .
2 .
3 .
4 .
in this respect , we therefore welcome the european parliament 's more specific amendments .
we are in favour of this , and we expect a decision by the council before the end of this year .
they support the efforts by the european parliament to help develop the legislative framework in the fight against terrorism .
however , the european parliament is still a long way off this crucial debate , as there is no mention of it in its resolution .
we have voted against it .
i therefore voted against the report .
i do not believe such a move is in the best interests of the future of the union .
in order to implement them , it is not necessary to create new institutions .
why did i vote against it ?
are there any comments ?
( the minutes of the previous sitting were approved )
order of business
i shall now put the request to the vote .
the order of business is thus established .
i expect better from the president of the commission .
this is a very important issue , on which we are all united .
( applause from the left )
this , then is the issue , this and no other .
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
that is not yet the case at the moment .
i have two points .
i believe it is against the european convention on human rights .
i should like to know whether there is anything further you can do on their behalf and whether you have had that reply .
i shall , of course , see what action i can take in this matter .
that is the request i would like to make .
madam president , this point may be of some interest to the house .
thank you .
i do not think so .
european food authority
this is an issue which is of considerable importance to people .
then of course it is up to us .
if we do that , the new food safety authority will be a step forward for the european union .
i call on you , commissioner , to make sure that is the case .
that is one step . it is a large step and also the first .
i am indeed of the opinion that something good can come out of a crisis situation .
at the beginning of 2002 , europe will create its own food safety authority .
why call it an ' authority ' when it has no legislative power ?
thank you .
that is the first point i would like to make .
we know how important it is that this decision is made .
i think that this regulation and this legal basis will , with the measures that follow , help to improve food safety in the european union , and will establish the general principles of the new food law .
what i consider most important is the fact that the framework conditions have been created for this authority .
mr president , my thanks go to the rapporteur for the excellent work on this report .
what do we actually mean by food safety ?
i have a few concerns in this respect .
the list goes on .
this proposal is one of key importance for consumer protection in the european union .
for these reasons i can support the principles expressed in the resolution .
i discussed these issues with each of you at some stage over the last few months .
thank you very much indeed .
we would have like to have achieved even more , especially as regards costs .
perhaps he could say something about the two points which i am particularly concerned about later on in the debate .
i find it hard to believe that the council could not accept this too .
these are the two matters which we wanted to see implemented , and now , thanks to the presidency state , they are in your proposal .
i have been given to understand that the commission is also of this view .
that is the direction we want to move in .
i hope that they will be pleased with the results that we have achieved .
you said that we have reached a good compromise .
i agree , and i think that many of my colleagues in my group will see it the same way .
it is an acceptable compromise .
it is right that in future the commission will have more power and scope for action .
i believe that the proposal does not go far enough in this respect .
and we can only achieve this in this way .
we are not giving anything away here .
i say , let the market provide the answer .
the fact is that market conditions do not always provide ' must carry ' .
that is something to which perhaps not enough attention has been given .
in this area , there is no market , as on many other issues .
here , i believe , there is a lot more work for us to do .
a new framework is therefore necessary .
it is not a question of more regulation .
it is necessary therefore to get the balance right .
what effects can we expect to see on jobs ?
it is , of course , a compromise .
here i particularly want to thank the european parliament for its strong support , without which we would not have been able to achieve this kind of compromise with the council .
we must absolutely encourage their use .
i will come back to that later .
i am sure it would be good for jobs , good for growth , good for equal access for all .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
but these things happen .
if this is true it is most welcome .
i want to believe it .
certainly we all have to do our best to make it true .
it is a great help but we have to do much more .
mr president , council , commission and parliament at last agree on something .
obviously there were too many services dealing with it .
thank you , mr president .
i would ask colleagues to support this report but also to support the amendment which makes this point clear .
i shall of course vote against this report .
the result we have achieved is a change of direction - a change to the right direction .
so , many thanks .
so , to all who took part , including our other colleagues , many thanks .
here , parliament achieved what it wanted .
this was the right step in the right direction .
the debate is closed .
president .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
president .
we would propose an urgent procedure without report .
( parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
a strong commission means a strong european parliament .
europe does indeed need structural reform .
we will also present a strategy for consumer protection and measures to support private investment in research and development .
one currency , one financial market and one economic policy , this must be our objective .
this will be the case in 2002 and will remain so for many years to come .
i do not know whether all of you will still be here later on , or tomorrow for that matter , when i am coming back to parliament .
for this reason i wanted to thank you now while you are all here .
having said that , this debate is not a matter of course for the presidency .
i would however like to make a few comments .
this is a very positive step , and i would like to welcome you and thank you .
i would now like to address the president of the commission .
( applause )
for that reason , relations between parliament and the commission need to be in good order .
i would very much welcome it if that were the case next time .
we also support what you have said about enlargement .
this is not the time to say which those countries will be .
we are prepared to do so , and will support the other institutions when they do the same .
( applause )
i believe that this is a type of training with a future .
that is all very well .
we agree .
it is difficult for us to work under such conditions .
why ?
still we have not received them .
we were better off with the last commission as regards the way in which the programme is presented .
my conclusion today is that the commission is there to propose .
it has the right of initiative but it is not the european government .
secondly , your programme does not really address the problem that we have , in fact , implemented very little of the 2001 programme .
in your paper you do indeed refer to implementation problems .
but the commission , too , has implementation problems .
i believe that at this particular moment this is especially important , as we are to have a convention .
now let us talk about the future , however .
i want to say this , mr president , because it is in the interest of parliament and the community as a whole to have a strong commission .
i , of course , welcome such a statement : it is essential for this process to work .
i have here the framework agreement between parliament and the commission agreed just two years ago .
it is in the commission 's interest as well as in our own interest .
new procedures must be agreed by both institutions .
i have several things to say on this point .
it will be an extremely important time .
the debate is closed .
this meeting can be considered a success for the world community , and certainly for the european union .
thank you for your attention .
that is an important new development .
you know what the commission 's views are on this .
this is true in the economic field as in the social and environmental field .
that is not a reason for giving up .
in any case , there were not enough representatives of the american parliamentary authorities to deal with this question seriously .
so that is where we stand at the moment .
my final point concerns agriculture .
i have said it in public .
not because we are pleased with all the aspects , far from it .
mr president , the current world trade negotiations are important to the future development of the eu , particularly in the context of enlargement .

food is extremely important !
we have created a framework which should work .
it is now down to the authority itself , and i wish it every success .
we agree with the principle .
i voted in favour of this report .
all i need is the money !
the next item is the joint debate on the following four reports , tabled on behalf of the committee on budgets :
i shall come back to this in due course .
i thank you for your attention .
once again , thank you all very much .
despite this , it was once again possible to reach agreement with the council .
unfortunately , i did not do this .
not a great deal of money is involved , but it is significant nevertheless .
this is the key point of our report .
that was an issue in itself .
what are we going to do about that ?
where is that money going to come from ?
if it does , it will be a welcome addition , but whether it would be agreed by the council is a different matter .
in conclusion , i should also like to mention the budget that we are about to vote on .
so i want to thank the general rapporteur and all the members of the committee on budgets .
the council did not accept this at second reading .
it is a small programme , but nevertheless an important one .
very quickly , i wish to move on to the other institutions budgets .
mr president , i again would like to congratulate the rapporteur , the commission and even , to some extent , the council for the work they have done this year .
but this parliament does not agree with the council 's way of doing things .
i also want to thank the council and the commission .
we also have fundamental matters to deal with .
the first concerns the reform .
i want to draw the attention of members and in particular of the rapporteur to two points .
thank you , mr president .
i , too , should like to congratulate all those involved in this budgetary procedure , which , as far as i can see , was an excellent procedure .
what will the commission do in that case ?
that is not my agenda .
but of course we must also ask the question whether that in itself is sufficient .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this applies especially to our cooperation with the member states .
what are his or her powers ?
i do not think you were being completely fair with us , commissioner , when you said it will only go so far and no further .
what powers would he or she have ?
what are the community 's financial interests ?
that agreement , though , is not yet in force , and the commission therefore proposed to include it in a directive .
i do not believe that is in the public interest , and it is certainly not in the interests of parliament .
it is that procedure that we must apply .
mr president , i just wanted to ask a few questions .
thank you very much .
thank you , mr president .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
you must be aware of the rules of procedure and apply them .
question time ( commission )
part i
thank you commissioner for a very full answer .
therefore it is a very serious problem .
we know that there is a real problem .
what programmes are in fact available to these states ?
this is just one other application .
i would like to hear the commission 's views in this regard .
i do not have anything further to say on the matter .
thank you , commissioner .
finally , the health and safety strategy is on the european commission 's list of priorities .
mr president , i actually have a further question .
this is no longer acceptable .
thank you , commissioner , for all the information which you have given me .
thank you very much , commissioner .
that is true .
the commission will present further proposals on animal transport in the light of this opinion .
it had the support of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and the committee on agriculture and rural development .
it is wrong that our money is being used in this way .
what is going on ?
i also believe , though , that there is still more that we can do to make the wto more democratic .
let me return to a point made in this morning 's debate .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the world trade organisation has a future .
madam president , we view with concern the decisions of the meeting of the world trade organisation .
thank you , madam president .
it did this , so from that point of view it was a success .
what will remain of europe ?
the eu had its way in agricultural issues .
changes to the agenda are just as important .
i would also like to thank the council .
there are just a few points that i want to address .
let me make another point .
i would particularly like to mention in this context two regions - the european union and the united states .
i have two specific questions , commissioner .
they are well pleased with the results .
for my part , i should like to make three comments .
what has become of our social responsibility ?
how can you help us , after what has happened at the wto , to make a new start and move things forward ?
that is both an opportunity and a responsibility .
we shall try to do better next time .
in reply to the question about the order in which things will happen , i can say that the real negotiations , particularly at technical level , will start at the beginning of next year .
the debate is closed .
i should like now to make a few comments on the programme itself .
although we are in almost total agreement with the council on the objectives of the programme and on individual issues , there is still a great deal of discussion as regards coordination and the budget for the programme .
finally , the budget .
there is a problem here .
however , the developments in the public health sector in the european union are going one step too far , in my opinion .
i see it as a matter for the member states .
some members have expressed doubt about everything having to be done at a european level .
however , as many of my colleagues have mentioned , the budget remains an issue .
health is what matters to the majority of eu citizens .
we should make sure that this programme matters .
i want to mention a few points i think need to be part of this programme .
madam president , first of all , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his work .
we must live in the real world .
first , the implementation of the programme .
the second area on which i would like to focus is the programme 's budget .
the decision on this matter is for the council and the european parliament , as the budgetary authority .
therefore we cannot accept these amendments .
therefore , we cannot accept these amendments .
the groups have come to an agreement among themselves .
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 1 , 2 and 3 as adopted by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
regarding amendments nos 2 and 3 on the date of application , the commission cannot accept the time period of six months .
thank you , madam president .
this is a fair position .
the debate is closed .
( applause )
i thank you all .
i would like to stress that this is a very serious problem .
we must stop this .
we must keep this in mind as we carry on our war against terrorism .
peace and security is the task of our time .
i hope all of you will take great interest in and help us make this a success .
for all this , we thank you mr president .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes of the previous sitting were approved ) president .
i hope that more respect will be shown in future .
area of freedom , security and justice
so let us look at the situation regarding each of these three aspects .
it demands an appropriate response and , indeed , a political response .
'
the working conditions in this house are , as a rule , among them .
this is not on .
europe has put its house in order .
the next step must be an agreement on better cooperation with the united states .
how can it be possible that there is nothing we can do ?
what , then , are our values and principles ?
we must vote against this resolution !
i would like to focus particularly on some of your questions , which in my opinion were very appropriate .
at the same time i would like to draw your attention to the particular progress that we have made in legal matters in the extremely short time in which we have been in action .
the council is aware of this matter .
the presidency has made this a priority .
i can understand it , above all , when i hear you speak .
( applause )
what has happened , has happened , and i cannot do anything about it .
you are right , but i cannot do anything about it now .
i am pleased to hear you say that the council is following parliament on this .
absolutely not , in most cases .
first there are the candidate countries .
it is also a question of our resources .
how pleased should we be now ?
it would be excellent if the commission and the council could show that this is not the case .
now , though , i really do want to deal with different subject matter , one that is very , very important to me .
however , in my opinion , there is still a long way to go .
let me start with the past .
and finally to the future .
( applause from the left )
the debate is closed .
that is what has to be done under the rules of procedure .
vote
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
in addition to that , i wish to reply to the rapporteur 's question .
now i find myself back here again .
it really is not on !
that was a compromise .
the possibility of guidelines for member states could be considered .
the house needs to know whether they ' will ' be considered .
this can be and will be considered .
the european parliament was to be involved in these discussions .
if so , will parliament be involved in the work of this group ?
i turn to the commission again for its opinion on the amendments .
the commission can accept in part ten amendments .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
unfortunately , they are not taken into consideration enough in this document .
we therefore support the commission 's proposal and the amendments proposed by parliament in its first reading .
( applause )
much of what has been achieved with the help of the international community is now at risk .
there is much further to go .
one final point .
what is past is past .
but we must go on .
let us follow their example .
what does that mean from my point of view ?
to give them rights ?
so you want to give them a national state .
the european union should lead this action .
we see it every day .
finally , i would like to ask the commission a question .
that is not the case .
we are in favour of peace , and we are trying to do our level best to achieve it .
perhaps i can just add one or two points in relation to the debate .
i will tell you what my idea of balance is .
i will tell you what i believe the european union should be doing .
the debate is closed .
however , a number of further provisions still need to be established .
and that is what concerns us .
work is under way on this issue too .
she put it forward because a solution has to be found .
so as far as we are concerned , everything is in order .
it seems to me that this is not acceptable .
and then the security rules .
the same applies to article 11 of the council decision .
why ?
has the commission adopted security rules ?
when will parliament adopt its own security rules ?
i would like to mention some of these .
' ' that is unfortunately something we do not know . '
the commission would show it is doing its job .
what we now have to do is to implement it , of course , and we must do all we can to really make it a success .
if you say general and policy criteria , then i would rather speak on a political level .
i have two specific questions for the commission and the council in addition to my colleagues ' questions .
i think that we must take another clear look at these things .
that is right .
mr president , i would like to put a question to the commissioner .
we have not .
so there is nothing new .
question time ( council )
as they deal with the same subject , question nos 1 to 4 will be taken together .
this was the first point i wanted to make .
i do not believe so , but this is a matter of opinion .
it is a solution that you are pleased with and i welcome this .
we will have to see how far we can go .
this is a joint answer .
time is not on our side .
this answer with real content is very welcome .
thank you .
i would just like to put two specific questions .
this is something that is on the increase .
as a member of this house you will understand why we need to call upon the solidarity and the common sense of all members .
thank you very much .
there is always something that can be done with it , and why should it not be included in a list of measures ?
what do i mean by this ?
we must therefore keep our own activities as governments and as industry in our countries well under control .
the funding and the framework are in place .
that is something i view in positive terms .
above all i would like to thank him for what he said about the external aspects of sustainable development .
it is based on four main objectives .
the honourable member raised this .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
, rapporteur .
so we still have to adopt un resolutions on this subject .
i will report back to parliament on the progress that is made .
thank you , commissioner .
that is more or less what our report says .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
together we have achieved a great deal .
i hope we can live up to that .
we should let the whole world know that .
no !
it should be done more quickly next time !
the legal framework is in place .
so we should implement more quickly the proposals parliament has made .
this is often the case when we draft legislation , but particularly so now .
we must now continue to work in this direction and promote the measures which are yet to be approved .
i think that he is right .
this must be seen as clear progress .
in this case too , parliament has had almost all its amendments included in the council 's common position .
thank you very much to all of you for your cooperation .
thank you so much , commissioner , for your important statement .
the joint debate is closed .
the first success has therefore been achieved .
in this case , the national requirements and conditions still apply for now .
something will therefore be done about this situation , and that is why we are also pleased with the communication .
i welcome the commission communication as a first step towards a solution of this issue .
i congratulate you .
i therefore hope that quite a few of the measures proposed by the rapporteur will be implemented , for example access to better information on the rules which actually apply .
it is particularly important that we work together to ensure that citizens have good access to information in this area .
and this is not the case here .
these questions have been received .
of course , work has been done on them , but that is all , really .
the debate is closed .
the european parliament , or at least the rapporteur , considered that this proposal raised two problems .
i can say on behalf of the legal affairs committee that we are in agreement with what the rapporteur has presented , and we will also , for our part , support it .
now i come to the tabled amendments .
i do not know what the discussion will lead to tomorrow .
we thank you on behalf of parliament .
the debate is closed .
they are there with many , many more children , and they have all been let down .
far from it .
but finally , after ten days , we were able to understand each other 's needs .
now i am not sure ' .
no more violence ! '
help them to live !
thank you very much !
are there any comments ?
( the minutes of the previous sitting were approved )
order of business
decision on urgent procedure
does any member wish to speak against the request ?
thank you .
we shall now hear a member who is in favour of this request .
( applause )
we shall now vote on the request for urgent procedure .
( parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
vote
madam president , first of all , i must mention that this is the last time we vote for a budget under your presidency .
so thank you very much .
once again , thank you all very much .
thank you very much , madam president .
( applause )
after the vote on the amendments
if that is what you mean , i do not see any problem in doing this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
on amendment no 1
we believe that parliament has made excellent progress within the budget on this point and amendment no 1 is therefore no longer necessary .
thank you , we shall take note of this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
does the commission wish to take the floor ?
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the proposal by the committee on budgets )
before the vote on paragraph 3
( parliament adopted the joint text )
( parliament adopted the joint text )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote on paragraph 5
' .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
as you know , the draft agenda has been adopted by this house .
that , then , madam president , is why i had to vote against this european parliament budget .
all of these are objective 1 regions .
i voted for it because it is important to have achieved this agreement .
why ?
no .
in current circumstances this court is needed more than ever .
allow me to mention four very important points .
there have been very positive developments in recent years .
i would therefore very much welcome your proposal .
where will the commission draw the line ?
they have , however , set things in motion .
finally , a word on costs .
that is really what we are discussing here .
that is an important point .
we must end it both within and outside the institutions .
as yet we have had no answer from you .
can you , commissioner , give us one today ?
we know how important it is for public institutions to set an example .
that is not the case .
we do not have the power to do it in the commission .
the debate is closed .
markets are also global .
i would call upon the council to adopt them this week .
regarding market state responsibility , the eu is a large market and so it must improve control measures .
we should go in that direction also .
the eu , as one of the most important regions from all these points of view , clearly has a special responsibility .
i therefore congratulate the committee on fisheries and our rapporteur .
all of these issues are in the report .
even in europe we can and must act .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i believe there is an important principle here in relation to access to information .
parliament has a right to know .
this is the reality .
it is set to continue - and why ?
that is the reality .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
at this point , however , i cannot do anything .
we have been wrong every time .
the resolution is a basis for action now .
the debate is closed .
in practice , things are very different .
the debate is closed .
human rights
that means they need support and practical help now in a special democracy programme .
instead , this must be a right .
i believe there is a lot of international experience in this area that we can draw upon .
i hope that the eu can offer support in this area , too .
everyone put their hand up - they all wanted to do something .
it is essential that those responsible are brought to justice .
immigration in ireland
then as now , it was said that this must not happen again .
this situation cannot continue .
we must look forward .
we hope change is possible , but this is a very difficult case .
we are all aware of this .
why ?
that is not enough , however .
i hope that turkey will be able to play its part in this house one day .
all the groups are agreed .
mr president , it may sometimes be necessary to take more time to say less .
the joint debate is closed .
other developments in the country must , however , continue .
they are excellent .
the joint debate is closed .
it is not up to us .
these measures are essential .
how are they going to be implemented ?
who will lead this action ?
i could not answer .
i could not answer that either .
the joint debate is closed .
new european labour markets , open to all , with access for all
mr president , i welcome parliament 's report on the commission 's communication on new european labour markets .
the debate is closed .
i welcome the fact that we are discussing this at all .
i hope that members will vote on the amendments we have also put forward to the joint resolution .
let us ensure that we all protect this .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i welcome today 's debate .
i am all for talking about it , i am all for talking more about it , i am all for the commission 's doing something about it .
we could have done a much better job if we had had more time , which is why our group does not support all the proposed amendments .
i think that article 3 is better than amendment no 4 .
why should i agree to your proposed amendment when our article in the resolution is better than your proposed amendment ?
we mean the same thing .
the joint debate is closed .
vote
during the vote on amendment no 2 to the joint resolution on immigration in ireland :
in any case , i should like to thank you for your proposal .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
i do not agree .
that is what is used throughout the document .
is that acceptable to the house ?
is that acceptable ?
( parliament adopted the joint resolution ) president .
how could i not have done so ?
are there any comments ?
( the minutes of the previous sitting were approved )
i am not going to make a speech .
thank you very much .
thank you , madam president .
thank you very much , madam president .
( applause )
i thank you for doing that .
thank you for what you have done for this parliament .
this has not always been the case in this parliament .
i would like to wish you well for the future .
at the end of the day , madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i believe we had to achieve a great deal .
in that context , i believe the form to be as important as the content .
one thing must be clear from now on .
i should , however , also like to thank the commission very much .
( applause )
we have a great responsibility .
( applause )
we now know that we have an opportunity to make a success of the new intergovernmental conference .
i would also like to thank you for all the effort that you have made in this area .
this is something i want to make very clear .
this means that strong initiatives must be taken in this area .
i therefore feel that we need to make a considerable effort in this area .
( applause )
as far as i am concerned , i would like to stress one single idea in relation to this .
the same applies to enlargement .
this , in any case , is what i believe .
i support the european union .
in particular there are three areas where urgent action is required :
why ?
however , i would like to ask one more thing , mr president-in-office . you have now held the council presidency for six months .
the first concerns the convention .
what has become of young people and , especially , women where this issue is concerned ?
these are the two reasons .
we share in this success , and have you to thank for it having been possible .
that is something new and we will have to get used to it .
( applause )
this is also what will actually happen .
my colleagues have often said to me , ' no , it is not a question you can ask ' .
i would say , ' why ?
it must be prepared .
i have therefore been able to use the authority of the committee of the regions to include these regions in the text for the first time .
( applause )
it is unacceptable and i should like an answer .
what is europe for ?
of course , there is still a great deal left to do .
let me make one last comment on what we call civil society .
that is a good thing .
we must clearly take this into account .
i must tell you that i do not want that at all .
of course , i respect the american model .
many questions have concerned the convention .
this is of no small importance .
it will be at that point that the political responsibility of the council will clearly be called into question .
i therefore have great confidence in the way the convention is going to develop .
this is another way to use this convention .
i think that i have been clear about the convention .
this is a start .
i believe that this is of importance .
i said just a moment ago that i fully share that point of view .
but there is still a long way to go .
we must therefore continue with our efforts .
however , i would say at the same time that , in our view , more is needed .
this could be done by the european parliament .
it is better than nothing but takes us no further .
on balance it is a very positive one .
on all that we can be pleased .
thank you very much .
what should we do ?
is there no way forward ?
i believe we should welcome this .
that is why i would now like to express a hope .
it has provided it with an excellent president and an open agenda .
however , the convention takes the fight for greater democracy and greater rule of law in the european union to a new level .
i hope not .
only go to european level for that which can only be done at european level .
that is the first point that i wanted to make .
they will not , therefore , be working alone , but rather in solidarity , which is a very different matter indeed .
however , that did not happen .
this means , however , that there is another risk , if i may say so .
the debate is closed .
order of business
good morning colleagues .
in two years we might have ten new member states .
how we vote today is part of that responsibility .
they share the information .
the commission and the council have all the information we cannot get .
our next president must ensure that all information is available to all of us and , if necessary , take the commission and the council to court .
but we must continue to try .
i ask you for your support .
reform will only be possible if the president has the support of all members across the whole house .
we need a president for all of parliament .
as you know , everything here is achieved by working together and through dialogue .
we must take action .
colleagues , today has been a good day for parliamentary democracy in the european parliament .
i thank you for it .
he has brought that too .
i thank you for all the confidence you have shown in me over the years .
( applause )
i thank all those who voted for me .
( applause )
why do i do this ?
( applause )
)
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
allow me to say a final word .
i wish you all the very best on behalf of our group .
( applause )
why ?
they are going to be members of the convention .
i look forward to working with you .
i look forward to working with you .
that is democracy in action .
( applause )
i wish you well .
i shall try .
you are now a president for everyone .
we hope that this cooperation will continue under your presidency .
we would like to congratulate you , of course .
and we think that you are the type of president that we want .
you are now everyone 's president .
but that is how things stand at the end of the day .
we have taken note of this as well .
mr president , you did it !
all the best .
i have just one comment to make .
i hope you are in agreement .
there may be special circumstances in the case of this request .
mr president , i have a question .
there is no rule on the matter .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )

( applause )
( applause )
are there any comments ?
are there any further comments ?
order of business
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , on a point of order .
decision on urgent procedure
that being so , i do not think that the request for urgent procedure should be agreed to .
i take note of that .
mr president , that is not the problem .
we know the essential point at issue .
this was precisely the point that was raised in the question of how we should vote .
( the vote was taken ) .
mr president , on a point of order .
that is my first point .
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , on a point of order .
i want to be clear on this .
thank you very much for your attention .
( applause )
we have achieved monetary union .
it is precisely these values that we have in mind when we speak of the ' european social model ' .
i am pleased to see , mr president , that you have made these areas a priority for your action in the coming months .
if there is no change , we will end up with less growth and less jobs .
first , employment .
third , education , training and research .
( applause )
mr president-in-office , i very much welcome what you had to say about the convention .
if you meet with success , then it is a success for us all , for the council presidency , for parliament , for the commission and for the european union that we share .
( applause )
i shall mention firstly the area of freedom , justice and security , with the fight against terrorism as a priority .
secondly , i will mention the euro .
there must be rules to protect citizens and consumers .
we share your concern .
i would ask the commission to put forward a practical proposal in this field .
you have not said what you think about ' more europe ' .
is it a cause for amendment ?
i would draw your attention , too , to our resolution on cooperation between the united states and the european union in the fight against terrorism .
the reform of the council that you talk about is most welcome .
( applause )
mr president-in-office of the council , first of all , i would like to welcome you to this house .
( applause )
the problem will be what to do next .
there is no place for terrorism in this area .
thank you mr president .
at the end of this week you will have 10 % less time left in the term of your european union presidency .
others may show some .
in our view , this would mean more europe .
so you must move on from words to actions , mr president .
what do you mean by more europe ?
more europe means more security , but also more freedom .
of the issues mentioned as priorities for the present presidency , i would like to stress the following three .
take that political and social reality further .
include it in your presidency .
there is another point i would like to make .
we do not think like that .
europe has to get it right .
we hope for very close cooperation with you on these issues over the next six months .
i will return to that in a moment .
i would also like to point out a cause for concern in relation to the question of immigration .
i am not going to get involved in that debate because this is a place for talking about europe .
these are fundamental to an open market .
i could not agree more .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , i welcome your presidency .
who is to fund them ?
thank you very much , mr president , ladies and gentlemen .
i do not think that the commission has any problem with this either .
i should like to focus my speech , if i may , on the presidency 's objectives and work programme and on no other matter .
the priority in the world today is security and the fight against terrorism .
secondly , this is a very important opportunity from the economic point of view . i say this for various reasons .
firstly , because for the first time we have the euro , our single currency , which is a guarantee of stability and which has been a great success .
they are right .
how can this be done ?
but we have to discuss such matters .
we also have to discuss matters in order to reach conclusions on some of your concerns about the importance of cooperation with russia in the fight against terrorism .
this is why we are discussing transport , energy and the financial plan .
this is why we are discussing education and employment .
thank you , president-in-office of the council .
vote
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament approved the common position )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
welcome
there are many , and mention has been made this morning of some of them .
thank you , commissioner .
from tomorrow , i shall be a member of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy .
i look forward to working on this task in future .
on the other hand , though , we also have to ask ourselves what conditions are required for the euro , our common currency , to be successful in the long term ?
let me here list three conditions .
it was by a large majority the will of parliament that these principles should be those of the social market economy .
even then we were saying that monetary union cannot exist in the long term without political union .
( applause )
the euro will become a success because it is accepted not only by the markets but also by people .
our commitment as a parliament to monetary dialogue with the european central bank was particularly important .
so let us act on that basis .
thank you .
mr president , i will speak on my own behalf .
in this way , the citizens know where they stand with europe .
the euro will be a strong currency if europe 's economy is strong .
we must now take an important next step .
no , it is not !
is the euro the beginning of economic government ?
this is our model .
of course , the structural reforms , as i said earlier , are still the key to the future .
obviously , there is nothing we can say on this point .
no , they have not .
there have indeed been practical problems .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
it has been proposed to increase this value .
another major issue is environmental and social concerns .
there is a need for change to be brought about here .
it is an excellent amendment , which i hope will be supported by the house .
i would draw attention to one final amendment , which is important .
i hope this amendment can be adopted tomorrow and we get a clear reference to this in the directive for the future .
these changes are significant .
that is in the text as well .
i think , then , that it must be possible on this basis to further improve these points in the commission 's text .
we must therefore go further and approach it in a different way ; this is the sense of the amendments tabled by my group .
this is why the directive would become just as difficult to implement as the current one .
i have the same experience where my own country is concerned .
competition in the internal market must not be allowed to be like that .
nor does the commission take that view .
who can best take that decision ?
is it best taken in brussels ?
we must have this kind of clear responsibility for the public good taken by public authorities .
i would like to hear the commission 's reply to that point .
mr president , i welcome the commission 's proposal for a directive and the report adopted by the parliamentary committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
we should not do it .
no !
that is it as far as the first directive is concerned .
the debate is closed .
"
and so we have this draft directive to address the problem .
but it is not appropriate now .
mr president , i believe that the directive , which is now in its third and final reading , will improve air quality in europe .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the objective of integration is of course that the environmental aspect be taken into consideration in the various policy sectors themselves .
for this reason i do not agree with these amendments .
i would also like to talk about principles .
the results , however , should be the same .
we must adopt it today .
so what should have been done instead ?
an environment action programme must naturally establish environmental objectives if there is to be any point at all in having a programme .
that is a proposal which we cannot support .
we must put this proposal in its context .
i wish particularly to mention amendment no 10 , which i think is important .
this concerns the european investment bank .
so what does the rapporteur want ?
i draw your attention to amendment no 11 , which is already out of date .
it does not .
in the old days we wanted an action programme in order to put pressure on the council to agree to legislation .
a lot of people have problems with that , and not only in our group .
that is why there are various proposals for compromise .
i am aware of the fact and accept responsibility for it .
moreover , our proposals will include these , and they must be discussed in both parliament and the council .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the commission proposal for the discussion process in committee was of little help , though .
this report is a start , but the real work on its content remains to be done .
i would agree with a lot of what has been said during this short debate .
however , i too am coming to the conclusion that we need to focus our actions on particular products and sectors .
the debate is closed .
we do not just want a more general commitment , we need a more general commitment .
i welcome the objectives set out in the communication for european policy .
then again , that has a great deal to do with principles .
the people of this world need common security and justice which applies to everyone .
my speech will focus on three points .
the third aspect concerns the future .
the answer is , a great deal .
the debate is closed .
road transport
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the common position also accepted this amendment so of course we have no problem there .
this amendment too was accepted .
this is the group , therefore , that should come under this regulation as soon as possible .
both the council and parliament agree on this .
the objective is that training should be equal .
i believe that these proposals are a step in the right direction .
this , too , is an important matter .
account is taken of this in the report .
just 5 % .
the joint debate is closed .
however , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
i agree that we therefore still have work to do , as we also have here in parliament .
the only question is how best to implement it .
i share his concerns on this .
we must also have instruments of political cooperation .
i think that we can achieve a great deal with this agreement .
i think that , on its own , it does not work .
this is not the case .
we have to use them in the best possible way .
there are real problems there .
this is why we do it .
we welcome this conclusion .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
there are no comments .
( the minutes were approved )
mr president , on a point of order .
thank you .
future of the common fisheries policy
it is therefore necessary to continue with the structural aid .
today , i am speaking on behalf of the committee on development and cooperation .
the committee on development has made a number of fundamental comments on the fisheries policy in relation to the development policy .
one can therefore understand that the common fisheries policy can have quite a considerable impact on developing countries .
the subject is simply too important .
in which direction do we want europe 's common fisheries policy to go in future ?
one thing , though , must be clear .
let us , by the end of this year , find a common and sustainable solution in the interests of our european fisheries .
reform is essential .
amendments nos 3 , 4 and 5 look to the international level .
this is as it should be .
no doubt the discussions this year in council will be difficult .
the new common fisheries policy is currently being prepared , and i would therefore like to draw the commissioner 's attention to three crucial points .
we believe in the future of the fishing industry .
i shall refer to two key issues .
i stress the word " management " .
i will mention three of the changes that we must make .
this is a considerable number , and it is obviously unacceptable .
can we achieve a proper balance ?
i do not think so .
would it mean more financial support ?
so we have to find an acceptable position .
we have an opportunity to get it right .
the debate is closed .
but we do .
i should like to wish the commissioner well .
we have to face the reality that this is going to be extremely difficult to achieve .
long may this continue .
the debate is closed .
environmental protection requirements and the common fisheries policy
the debate is closed .

madam president , on a point of order .
" and this is true .
this is important now , and it will be no less important when enlargement is a reality .
i doubt whether that is true .
the debate is closed .
national authorities and the social partners will have to step up their efforts and see to it that existing legislation is fully applied .
and yet , on this matter , the member states have had no development strategy in place .
the debate is closed .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i , too congratulate you , madam president , on your new position .
( the matter was referred back to the committee responsible )
what is going on ?
did this happen or not ?
and for us then to decide .
'
because the matter has been referred back to the committee , the debate will not now take place .
i will say more about this in a moment .
it is vital that we get this right .
after all , we cannot all take part .
i should like to make three points .
i mentioned the global framework .
the debate is closed .
vote
i voted for the motion , mr president .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes of the previous sitting were approved )
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , most of you will be aware that i have taken a different line from our president .
unfortunately , i do not think that the council will look upon this in a positive light , but rather as something that it can do again .
that is what we expect tomorrow .
( applause )
i would now like to turn to the amendments .
the issue of drugs is a central concern of europe 's citizens .
this is why my group , together with three other groups , has tabled an amendment in order to have such criteria included .
however , i am not so certain .
i do not accept that .
the decision has to be up to the members of this house .
we must know who they are .
i thank him for his efforts in this respect .
what have we done wrong ?
however , this is an issue that is being discussed at council level .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this , then , is another reason why a regulation would be the more appropriate legal instrument .
in the debate that took place in the committee on legal affairs and the internal market on this issue , several amendments were tabled : some were serious , others less so .
why is this ?
- and integration itself .
in that respect , i believe this to be a major and important step forward in europe .
the commission 's proposals were certainly better than what is now proposed in those areas .
that , for a start , is the right approach .
the debate is closed .
finally , i should like to stress one important aspect .
the debate is closed .
workers ' rights
the next item is the joint debate on :
i feel that this is a particularly important point and it has been the subject of much debate .
i would point out that we were three women , the three of us , in particular , working on this directive .
if that is the case , then i should like to say the following .
in conclusion , community instruments exist or are in the process of being adopted .
it is not the only example .
this is a good result , in my view .
some governments are aware of this situation .
in short , there is a lot to be done .
nor do i believe that the governments of the member states can do very much .
what was possible has now been done .
three women have been involved .
i believe that this is where we have to make a start .
i will certainly fight to make sure it is the last .
we should want to see more jobs , not less .
that is the situation we face .
the joint debate is closed .
therefore , anything that is done in this field has a special effect from this point of view .
i wanted to stress three aspects of the directive .
so i have tabled amendments to that effect .
these are not all the same things .
we are really a long way from being able to achieve that .
but it is a step in the right direction .
it is important to consider both large and small measures .
the whole of society must share responsibility for these efforts .
most of the amendments proposed take these principles into account .
the debate is closed .
i also wish to thank my colleagues .
now it is also russia 's turn .
there are clear opportunities for growth in this area .
there are , therefore , many demands upon the european investment bank .
mr president , i should like to welcome the commissioner to the house .
finally , i want to comment on the amendments that have come in .
i agree with that .
i should like to comment on a few of these areas of concern .
there is a need to go further , however .
we must not stop the support measures .
there must be changes here .
i would like to make two further comments .
the debate is closed .
financial services legislation
in this context , the commission is now in a position :
the commission could accept amendments adopted by parliament to this end ;
what , then , is this debate about ?
that proposal is a very good one .
where , then , is the problem ?
what have our negotiations with the commission and the council now achieved ?
what have we achieved ?
transparency first of all .
what this means is that , today in any case , we as a parliament are in a very strong position in this context .
that is also very important .
we have a third step forward and that is a guarantee in case all this does not work .
but there has been a key problem .
however , the commission itself cannot do that ; any such change has to take place in connection with the next intergovernmental conference .
that is also what parliament would want the commission to do .
the commission is well aware of that .
that is a success in which we all share .
that is , without a doubt , very important .
we shall pay attention to that .
i believe that today is a great day for all of us .
this report is an important step towards making this possible .
so far , so good !
i think that the commission must make a commitment to show respect for the resolutions adopted by parliament .
and what are we doing today ?
that is the next step and also what we in parliament expect .
this must not be allowed to happen in europe .
i am very pleased to say that we are making good progress in this work .
he said that the commission should show respect for parliament 's resolutions .
the commission does show respect for parliament 's resolutions .
the debate is closed .
this is , of course , vital to the candidate countries , as i have already said .
there is much that it can be used to achieve , but not everything , which is why i am against these proposals .
he already mentioned health aspects during previous discussions a few months ago .
for this reason , the commission cannot accept this first amendment .
i would also like to comment upon the two other amendments adopted in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
vote
the next item is the vote .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament referred the proposal back to the committee )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the joint text )

( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
to parliament ' .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is a problem .
i call upon the presidency to take the necessary measures .
although the right to vote was , in principle , adopted in part , the conditions of application are not mentioned .
why is that ?
at this point there are certain opportunities which i would like to mention to you .
what can we do from now on ?
we must continue in this direction , which was the one taken by the last general affairs council .
we can and must continue to fight against violence .
that is where we stand , ladies and gentlemen .
i cannot tell you at this point that i have great hope .
ladies and gentlemen , i believe that the european union is doing all it can to try to bring a little hope to this process .
i cannot say that there is a lot .
this is the idea we are working on .
i cannot guarantee success .
but i believe we must continue working in that direction .
there is no other solution .
there is no guarantee of that .
therefore , ladies and gentlemen , this is what we are doing .
i believe that we must work with them .
i am going there as often as i can to talk to each of them .
there is no doubt that it is , and must continue to be , our main concern .
( applause )
i wish you well for a very successful presidency .
( applause )
again , why ?
we know they are true from our experience .
( applause )
we expect there to be new countries in the european union in the next few years .
( applause )
( applause )
all this we welcome .
( applause )
we are , though , still a long way from doing that .
where , though , does it get us ?
( applause )
( applause )
you will say to me ' but who are we to do this ?
'
this is why we must not give up .
they know one another very well , they do the same thing .
that is not the problem .
nothing can be done .
we have to put up with the situation .
this is not true ; there is always another solution .
we must therefore make ourselves heard .
what do we think of this ?
welcome
that is the reality today .
this proposal has been put forward .
i think there have been five in the last ten days .
therefore , it is up to us , to europe to do something .
how can he do this ?
my view is his as well .
what can the european union do ?
no , we are not .
and then we have another crisis within europe .
that is the problem we have at this point in time .
they work together every day .
the same thing has happened on the other side .
that is something we have to do .
this is not a question only of values .
the debate is closed .
that is something i welcome .
it will create problems for us and we must discuss this .
such is my first important question in this context .
there is one question i have to ask .
mr president , i have a short question for the commissioner .
why cannot we just use the treaty as it is ?
i have one major concern and that concerns my own country .
this is clearly something which could not be accepted .
this should cause us to be concerned for the consumer .
i would like to make some comments .
to that extent , i am in support of the proposals .
in this way , far better use could , in fact , be made of the internal market .
the commission has a role to play in this .
the debate is closed .
question time ( commission )
thank you very much , commissioner .
at this stage i might say that there has been progress .
mr president , i agree with the honourable member that words are words and only actions are important .
if you wish to ask your question , the commissioner will reply .
in some countries this report has received a very positive welcome .
i think it has .
it was accepted today in the commission .
all these issues are extremely important .
through them we can guarantee education for all .
should that be a solution ?
i will reply to that after we have done some more internal work .
thank you very much for your cooperation , commissioner .
first , may i thank you for your support .
thank you , commissioner , you are of course quite right .
we are already more or less at the end of the second year .
what progress has been made ?
thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
there are two main rights that workers have through these regulations .
there were many discussions over many years .
however , we will do all that we can .
in conclusion , work is well in hand .
i thank the commissioner for his answer .
is a strategy being put in place to deal with that ?
give us some hope that it will happen .
we need to show a great deal of energy and commitment .
so we are making progress .
we are going to put the last question to the commissioner .
subject : international criminal court
i also support the commission 's proposal for a directive , in addition to which i propose measures in my report to make direct cooperation between the authorities still more effective and practical .
there is one point , however , where the commission proposal goes too far .
finally , something should be said about the legal basis .
that means that there was excellent communication between all the parties involved .
many thanks for that .
having said this , i would like to make two additional comments with regard to the content of this report .
it is about administrative cooperation .
i wish the commission could do that .
we have wanted to do so for many years but we are not able to do so .
but no , it is about administrative cooperation .
thank you , commissioner .
state aid
some of us do that from time to time in this house , and i will give an example of it later .
that cannot always be done .
it is sometimes more appropriate to achieve something by means of legal regulations , but also sometimes just as practical to do it by means of control in line with the market .
that was something called for by all groups in parliament .
that , then , is something i value .
the commission is doing this on its own initiative and because it is right to do so , but it is also doing it because it was called upon to do it .
we have six amendments to consider tomorrow .
we do not always agree , but i am very pleased with the report , even if there are a number of things we have to discuss regarding how we are to vote tomorrow .
tomorrow , we in parliament will vote on a proposal we did not have time to discuss before the vote .
we in parliament have time and time again called for action that would guarantee greater transparency in this area .
there has been good progress made recently in that area by the council .
i have nothing new to report on this .
thank you , commissioner .
for example , we have created the european food authority .
i want to point out some of the measures we propose for the future in the report .
they are the responsibility of the member states .
our objective is food safety .
these are the things i want to say .
it is high time that was done .
however , this makes no sense .
we must make it our concern .
just try making sense of that .
we have to ensure that the measures will also continue after the enlargement process is over .
that is still the case .
i therefore also support those amendments that provide for this .
i want to thank him for this report .
however , the situation will remain under review .
there were a number of points raised by members that i would like to refer to .
that ban is in place and will remain so .
there is no debate concerning that issue .
thank you , commissioner .
that is why there is a need for research .
there is , however , one aspect of the council decision that concerns me .
however , although we know what the community strategy is , what role should the member states play ?
priority measures should be direct action in key economic sectors .
that is something that i welcome .
some have already referred to that .
that is very important .
i would like to add my thanks to those expressed here both to the rapporteur and the commissioner .
there has also been talk of the economy in this debate .
we must also have confidence in this and include the united states in the process .
if it is to be possible to achieve this objective , the eu should set a good example .
i hope that this will be possible .
thank you for your views and for this debate .
education and training systems
the same applies to education .
this is welcome .
thank you , commissioner .
statement by the president of the european parliament
europe needs a new foreign policy and i am certain in this house there is a majority and a will to create that foreign policy .
we need it and the work is excellent .
( applause )
( applause )
that is our business .
colleagues , we still have a long way to go on the question of internal reform .
i do not know what progress we can make but i express this hope today .
( applause )
i believe that we should work with the other institutions to do this as a matter of priority .
( applause )
this is something we cannot allow !
( applause )
much has been said about the convention .
we need working procedures for the convention .
if that is how we go about our business in future , we will achieve something .
( applause )
we must keep this up .
the convention is what is most important in connection with the europe of the future .
a great deal of progress has been made .
the will to reform is there .
we must clearly establish the legal basis for our actions once and for all , and not let our legal basis be taken away .
we fully support you in doing this .
how can this be achieved in practical terms ?
i welcome that .
let us debate the political issues .
that is important too .
they too have a role .
it did not want to answer questions .
we should not accept that .
much reform is required within this house .
we will support that reform .
that was not good enough then .
it will not be good enough now .
consideration should perhaps have been given to having that meeting in this house to let all members see what is going on .
think again , mr president , when these matters come up for debate and discussion .
that is good , right and proper .
let us have debate and discussion .
are we doing parliament justice ?
mr president , you have made a great start .
i wish you well and i will be with you right along the way .
that is no longer the case .
but , at the same time , you have also done the same with the institutions .
if you achieve progress in these three areas , you will have achieved very much indeed .
it is out there that really matters to us .
but it is right that we should .
i thank you for your contribution this morning .
in my view , communication and information are crucial in this connection .
information more so than communication .
they are not the same .
how will we deal with this ?
the three institutions have to improve the quality of legislation .
this is why we have to improve the committee 's system of communication with our citizens .
mr president , i too would like to congratulate you on an excellent start to your presidency .
i agree with everything that has been said about reform .
i am sure we can do that .
it is very important that we work on this culture for change .
if we do that i guarantee that the other two institutions will also benefit .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate :
and
what do these measures do ?
it requires a serious response .
i agree with this .
they are not even referred to .
however , i do have some concerns .
this is a very positive response .
that is a good thing , that we help each other .
we will never consider it to be enough .
i think that is why we understand each other very well .
think about this when you vote , ladies and gentlemen .
thank you , mr president .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we want to see practical results .
european agricultural policy must change to benefit the third world .
access to the global market is essential for developing countries .
mr president , all those taking part in the summit must ensure that it is a success .
the european union has a responsibility to do this .
vote
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
and
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
mr president , i share your view .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
'
'
i have voted against this report .
unfortunately , it was not .
all this is also having further consequences .
but there is no guarantee as to how this legislation will be used .
but this has not happened .
i hope this is achieved in the future .
existing community aid will , of course , continue .
this is why we have voted against the report .
i voted in favour of a reform of the common agricultural policy that takes into account the objective of food safety .
the first is the demand for development aid .
however , mr president , we need to take action .
i have to say that the european union is in a very special position at this type of conference .
this is on our agenda for the first time .
it has never really been discussed at eu level before , either between the commission and the member states or between member states themselves .
so we have made it a new area of discussion .
the debate is closed .
finally , a word on two countries of particular interest , both to me and to this parliament .
i agree absolutely with everything the commission has said .
a lot of countries give considerable cause for concern .
allow me to mention three areas .
let there be a resolution this year .
all of these issues are on the agenda .
we deal with them every day and significant progress has , of course , been made over the last few years .
all these points are questions precisely of democracy , indeed they are questions which are crucial to democracy .
this has to be a convention that will debate .
the committee on legal affairs voted for it clearly and my own group has tabled some amendments .
'
the commitment to parliamentary democracy is made at the european level .
let us support it with our vote .
i therefore very much hope that this can continue .
but that is not enough .
let me congratulate the rapporteur and , therefore , express my support for him .
much can be done in this area and there is much still to do , so i believe we should come to an agreement and work together .
why must we do this ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
management of regional policy and the structural funds
now i wish to focus on the report 's most important conclusions .
monitoring should be more concerned with results : what has been achieved with funding and how .
obviously , there is still scope in this field to give the member states and the regions more responsibility .
therefore , we believe that it is time to give both the funds , on the one hand , and parliament on the other , a greater political role to play .
question time ( council )
questions concerning this case have already been put to the council in the past .
i thank the minister for his reply .
mr president-in-office of the council , thank you for your answer , but , with all due respect , i would like to ask you the question once again .
2 .
' .
the eu 's position on this issue has always been positive .
there will be no lack of opportunity for this to happen .
and the union 's policy on all these issues has therefore been , and will always be , the same .
how does the council view this state of affairs ?
which member states do not do so ?
the debate will be open and free .
the intergovernmental conference will decide on this issue at the appropriate time .
they are important questions .
this , then , is my question to you , mr president-in-office .
i therefore agree with what the honourable member said .
no , mr president .
therefore , the council is not in a position to comment on the issues mentioned by the member who has asked the question .
i did not receive a reply to this specific question .
and will he use the office of the presidency to promote support in third countries outside of the eu ?
the commission has taken no initiative in this area in relation to the council .
perhaps he will now answer the point .
i would firstly like to thank you for your answer to the previous question on this same subject .
mr president , i have nothing to add to what i have already said .
on tax issues , for example .
you say that we shall keep trying to achieve something more specific in the future .
it is these to which i wish to give particular attention .
negotiations on the programme still took up too much time .
like you , we have seen that there are some difficulties in the management of funds .
i took note of these proposals and the comments for use in the debate and i will take them into account .
in fact , i shall be doing this in a few days ' time .
( applause )
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
economic and social cohesion
of course , the process has not yet reached its conclusion .
do something about this problem , commissioner !
the problem is not a small one .
now to my final point . we need to achieve a balance between the candidate countries and the regions we have supported to date .
i would like , in my contribution to this discussion , to focus on the future of regional policy .
the financial means this policy needs must of course be made available .
we are not talking about the cohesion funds .
along with enlargement , europe is therefore in need of greater solidarity .
there must therefore be sufficient budget resources for the whole of this process .
does that apply to other public sector organisations ?
i would like to know what the commissioner 's position is .
what do we want to do together ?
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i shall end here .
i should like to comment on two amendments accepted in committee .
we take the view that we may well support the commission 's proposal in principle , but that we do want to bring about some changes on a few points .
i do not believe that is the case .
i would like to make some comments on the report we are dealing with here .
the debate on this report is closed .
i should , therefore , like to welcome the conclusions of that summit and call on the council and the commission to take them into consideration .
the debate is closed .
i hope that we will get to that , and believe that it is high time we did .
no decision on it has as yet been reached .
that has already been said several times .
they would do all that for us , and it would be for the best .
we want europe to have a common foreign and security policy .
i will just focus on three aspects which have been referred to here in relation to the report .
no state should have to put in another additional euro .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
i actually voted against .
( the minutes were approved )
mr president , i should like to make a comment on today 's agenda .
i think this is an area where women like us need to work together even more .
however , there is still much progress to be made .
i also thank the rapporteur for her efforts .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , those were the points i wanted to mention .
the debate is closed .
social policy agenda
we are sure of this , even if it is not currently given much consideration .
the result is there for everyone to see .
after all , commissioner , there are quite a few reasons why we are concerned .
i will give you a few reasons why we are concerned .
i should therefore like to say one thing in conclusion , mr president .
mr president , i would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work .
i am in favour of the report , but i have specific concerns .
however , the commission has proposed something different .
we have not yet achieved as much as we should have done for those people .
it is a new instrument that is being developed .
i welcome this instrument , and would want to make two comments in this respect .
first of all , we have developed a great deal of european legislation .
there are two main reasons why i believe that demands for legislative initiatives within these areas are the wrong road to go down .
we are not being given the opportunity to vote against individual points in the report .
unfortunately , the initiatives are , as i said just now , to be taken at the wrong level .
they should be taken at national level .
my second comment concerns time .
the debate is closed .
welcome
( applause )
vote
before the vote
joint motion for a resolution
( parliament adopted the resolution )
regarding amendment no 2
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i hope that this is acceptable to everyone .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
regarding paragraph 5
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote
many of us believe that is a very important question .
i therefore propose that be done .
the amendment is adopted .
mr president , i am content with that , but they are on different points .
whether there are more nations is a different question .
that is all this amendment says .
i therefore believe that this is a completely different statement .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
of course , we are not at this stage yet .
there is not much hope !
the convention is extremely important and we all support it .
the amendments tabled by my group have also supported this statement of political objectives .
. i voted in favour of this report , but would like to stress some key aspects in relation to fisheries policy .
we should look at that .
equal opportunities policy is the same throughout the european union .
both countries are responsible for the stability of the area .
the only way forward is through negotiations .
there is almost no other situation like this in the world .
mr president , i too should like to congratulate you and wish you every success in office .
the debate is closed .
that is my first point .
the debate is closed .
human rights
we can only congratulate them on their efforts .
this call comes both from united states society and this house itself , which i hope will adopt the resolution .
this is unacceptable .
such a court could be set up by a un security council resolution .
it would be good if the whole parliament could support this .
we have shown this very clearly through our vote earlier today .
we have to speak out in the interests of international justice , respect for human rights and respect for the rule of law .
this is not clear at present .
the people will see to that .
that is also the reason for our resolution .
this has to be the fundamental question .
in the majority of cases there is agreement between the european union and the united states .
he is in the right !
he is within his rights to use freedom of speech .
i therefore ask you to support this motion for a resolution .
the present draft resolution is therefore right to point this out .
i do not think that this is a matter for the council alone .
human rights are not just for our benefit . they are not to make us feel good .
the debate is closed .
and that is after cooperation between the commission and the government .
the debate is closed .
state of implementation of working time directive
however , there is still a lot of work to be done .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that really is what this is all about .
we understand our role and responsibility here .
thank you , commissioner .
the next item is the joint debate on :
a lot has been done , but there is a lot to do .
there are problems .
it is a vital debate .
i think that this is very important .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
vote
( parliament adopted the resolution )
statement by the president
mr president , thank you for that statement .
order of business
i move now to the order of business .
( the house agreed to this proposal )
i hope that the house can support us in this decision .
mr president , this change to the agenda was not taken into account when you made your proposal .
decisions taken at today 's meeting
within the union , our main objective is to step up progress towards a european area of justice , security and freedom .
( applause )
mr president of the commission , we can of course go along with everything that you have said .
the council is not here today .
i believe that there is an urgent need for reforms to the european council of ministers !
( applause )
in my opinion , this is a good idea .
the second point is security .
this we have done .
you have our support .
i will make a final point .
in relation to the convention , we are in agreement ; i also welcome the fact that you said it was a joint initiative of parliament and the commission .
i believe this is very important .
this is the line we are taking .
it is my opinion that , if that crisis had not happened , we would not have the convention now .
allow me to thank you for your contribution to the new procedure we have now brought about .
which countries will take part ?
that is major progress .
mr president , i asked earlier to take the floor for a point of order .
this is what i wanted to say :
mr president .
this is the situation in which we have to take a decision .
however , in the nature of the case , i can have no view and parliament should take no view about these points .
i have four comments to make on this report .
the next item is the joint debate on :
mr president , i will comment on two points in particular : coordination of economic policy and structural reforms .
i will comment on the three areas in that order , mr president .
i will now refer to the financial markets , mr president .
i am sure we can look after the council presidency .
thank you very much , mr president .
we will then , at last , be able to move on to the final stage - the stage of practical implementation - and then the citizens too will understand what we are doing .
and it is precisely the council which will have to set the priorities in these matters .
( applause )
thank you , mr president .
in your own country , mr president-in-office , you and your own policies have been very successful over the past years .
we are in a new situation .
we believe that what we have to do , and we have been doing so for some time , is to make progress on the creation of these markets .
the european parliament has done its job .
the process of economic reform is not an end in itself .
we shall therefore follow the vote , amendment by amendment , before we adopt a position .
it is the most important aspect to come .
i will tell you why .
sustainable development is going to be very important in the context of enlargement .
my third point : the areas of agreement that have been expressed here .
firstly , reform of the education systems .
training and education are at last being given political priority .
it is up to us , mr president , to show them that a common future is possible .
i think this plan is a really good initiative .
i hope they , or rather we , will be heard .
we have to decide as a european union what we mean by sustainable economic growth and it is not what we are voting about here .
the real question , however , is what europe ?
how did this come about ?
this must also be put a stop to .
nevertheless , i would like to make a few comments .
i would like to call on the council and the commission to give their attention to these problems .
this is unacceptable .
( applause from the right )
and yet , what do we have ?
what do we have ?
in the area of agriculture and fisheries , we are all aware of the problems .
mr president , a great deal has been said already .
i have just two comments to make .
why ?
the summit should therefore consider what can be done to increase this pressure .
thank you , mr president .
the candidate countries have been mentioned .
the debate is closed .
international criminal court
the next item is the council statement on the international criminal court .
mr president , right is wrong .
the debate is closed .
moreover , these are large political parties more often than not .
i believe that we cannot accept that .
but more than anything , it is about the need for crucial political reforms .
it is the very least that we can demand of a country that will tomorrow be taking part in the convention on the future of europe .
the joint debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
we must ensure value for money .
it does not go into how often and in what way .
it is therefore unacceptable in its current form .
this is the last thing our citizens want to see .
this is a state of affairs that we cannot accept .
however , we have different views on how this was achieved .
here , the commission has decided to take the next step .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports , on behalf of the committee on budgets :
it made no reference at all to parliament !
having said this , the funds are community funds raised by the citizens .
the debate is closed .
let us hope so !
i would therefore call for a vote in favour of the amendment .
that is not the case .
that is why , mr president , we shall support item 15 of the draft resolution .
thank you very much mr president .
the debate is closed .
impact of transport on public health
we need to be very clear about that .
i hope very much that the other groups will accept that too .
action in this field is urgent .
i would also call upon the commission to do the same .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is the objective of article 1 .
here are a few points to consider .
that , ladies and gentlemen , is all i have to say .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is why it is vital for parliament to take the council and commission to task during these procedures and , of course , to make its own contribution .
my second point is the question of financial control .
the commission should be given the necessary support here through parliament in general and the committee on budgetary control in particular .
i think we have the right to expect results .
this is unacceptable to my group .
what is the reason for that ?
we really have achieved what we set out to do .
i welcome the report which is positive .
thank you all again .
that is great !
the new procedures are now in place .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
culture 2000 programme
i hope it does not and we shall fight to see that it does not .
given the current situation , these are the questions we need to ask when we think of the future .
i should like to add this to the agenda , so that we can also have an impact on the convention .
we have two major problems .
everyone in europe has to find a place in society .
what then did we find now we have a single large programme ?
matters of principle need to be discussed .
what should the role of member states be ?
what should the european union do ?
unfortunately , it is not even to be found in the practical implementation of culture 2000 .
to stage major events to reach as many people as possible in one go ?
you are quite right .
the debate is closed .
there is a need for further work here .
i think that is acceptable .
we see this success as considerable , as we are talking here only about the first year of implementation .
i see that , though , as appropriate .
this good work will , of course , continue .
the debate is closed .
vote
the next item is the vote .
parliament adopted the decision .
parliament adopted the decision .
before the vote :
parliament adopted the resolution .
parliament adopted the resolution .
parliament adopted the resolution .
parliament adopted the resolution .
parliament adopted the resolution .
parliament adopted the resolution .
parliament adopted the resolution .
parliament adopted the resolution .
parliament adopted the resolution .
no , mr president !
this is the reason why we voted for this regulation .
for society ?
for the workers themselves , in terms of health , for example ?
from here , it is only a very small step to state that certain workers cost too much .
each member state should have full responsibility for its social security systems and the right to make its own decisions about them .
we are therefore also voting against european coordination in the area of tax .
this is , for me , a reason to vote against .
the member states !
what does this mean ?
sustainable development strategy
i have voted in favour of the report .
international criminal court
this is why we will not be voting for this proposal .
we feel that this is not the case .
democratic rights in turkey
the resolution should go further , however , as the statement by our group does , a statement with which i fully agree .
this is still not the case in turkey .
it was good for individual freedom and good for the economy .
this is what i have done .
we now move to the order of business .
this is the only reason , mr president .
mr president , i really did not understand that .
mr president , the reason for this request is not a political reason , to do with any one group .
( applause )
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , on a point of order .
the authorities in france are not doing anything ; the commission is not taking action .
i have asked the commission to address this situation .
mr president , on a point of order .
"
to date we have received no reply .
the third and final question is democracy .
development aid has been mentioned , and that is all well and good .
i do not think we will get very far if we do not change our approach .
this is a subject to which europe should give greater attention .
so are there no problems at all ?
having heard your comments , i am going to refer to each of these issues : firstly , development aid .
is this sufficient ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it will cost money to turn this report into a reality .
we would ask the commission how much .
many thanks .
that was precisely what the people did .
this report is not before time .
, rapporteur .
but it is wrong to see it simply in those terms , because there is more to it than that .
i hope that is so .
that is the case and will remain so .
as soon it is available we will make it available to members of this parliament .
the debate is closed .
i think that the three amendments proposed by our committee improve things still further and are , i believe , acceptable both to the commission and the council .
did the council agree with that ?
did we get that ?
we asked for special services to be taken out of the directive .
did they agree with that ?
did they give us that ?
i am certainly not one of them either .
this is very important .
our group will therefore adopt the three amendments tabled by the rapporteur , but not the others .
why ?
there is nothing new in the debate .
there is absolutely nothing new here .
this is positive .
after all , the situation is quite different in the different member states .
and this is no small matter .
in fact , the council accepted four out of the five basic principles we put forward .
what is the most important aspect of this discussion ?
what is the issue here ?
let me mention four points .
this concerns amendments nos 1 , 2 and 3 .
the debate is closed .
i hope that we can at least get this right .
that , though , is our objective .
that is why this issue is so difficult .
i hope that we shall support transparency and that , here in parliament , we shall at least be able to question those proposed for the office in question .
the rights balance each other out .
we have the basis for legislation on transparency in place .
the debate is closed .
that is the purpose of the work of reform in our parliament .
i believe that we have made a very great deal of progress in the best interests of ourselves , the institutions and the people .
the commission has the right of initiative .
we have the right to call upon the commission to make proposals already given to us in the treaty .
it has the right of initiative .
the debate is closed .
thank you .
and
the budget debate will also be a little different .
we are entirely agreed that the most important political priority is eu enlargement .
this is therefore a very important concern for the european parliament too .
there are three priorities in the guidelines for the administrative budget on which we now have to adopt a position .
the first is enlargement .
in the short term , it is entirely possible to deal with this .
that would just not be on .
let me say a few words about the most important priorities in the report .
when it comes to enlargement , a number of issues are particularly important .
this means we might only have just under a year .
a great deal remains to be done in this time .
in the foreign policy field , as has indeed been our experience from the very beginning of this parliamentary term , greater demands will again be made on us .
that , again , is of course a new step .
this will continue to be a priority for the next few years .
we must try to address that question , or at least get the council to address it .
they have different needs in terms of budgets .
that is not the commission 's doing , but rather an amendment proposed by members of this house .
issue no 2 : foreign policy .
there is more to come .
let the council state which of the european union 's activities it can do without , and then funding can be provided on a serious basis .
issue no 3 : agricultural policy .
it should not be left to parliament .
i hope that it is not left to the council either .
we have to deal with the problems of the world , which are not without their effects on us .
in the last few years , we have had to move reform of the commission forward , but we also have internal problems that have to be discussed further .
clearly , there is something wrong !
this is not a day too soon .
furthermore , there is reason for great concern with regard to the commission 's policy .
i think this is a step forward that we must follow through .
i fully support that particular point .
i wish them every success .
given the total , this is a very small amount .
we will not achieve anything that way .
we expect a more positive response from the commission and , in particular , the council , in those two areas which are so important to our group and to the whole of parliament .
in this report , we do not want agricultural reform right now .
what we need is a further development of european agricultural policy .
why ?
however , i would like to draw your attention to and focus on a different matter .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
secondly , it will only work if the same conditions apply throughout europe , that is if there is regulation .
i should like to make this absolutely clear here and it is also in the committee 's motion for a resolution .
perhaps i might make the following additional points on the reports .
what is on today 's agenda ?
so what are the key points ?
but that is precisely what it is .
'
this must change .
commissioner , i should like to bring three points to your attention .
second reading might provide an opportunity to change this .
i am in favour of these measures .
that is the aim of my amendment .
this is considered part of equal access to public services .
i hope that the council will take this into consideration .
there has been a lot of comment about the pressure under which this debate is taking place .
i should like to make two points .
i look forward to working with you in the vote tomorrow .
this is relevant .
next i will mention the amendments which we find difficult to accept .
we cannot therefore accept this amendment either .
this has to do with our voting procedures and so on .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
and
before the vote :
mr president , there is always a great deal to say about the commission 's budget , as there is about parliament and all the other institutions ' budgets .
i believe that we have found that compromise .
the solution to the conflict with the united states is very close .
what can be done about this ?
and why the benefit of the doubt ?
and i wish you , commissioner , every success .
that is why it is really important for us to consider what we want to stand up for .
once again many thanks to the rapporteur .
i do not think so .
for this we must take another look at article 5 ( 1 ) , and we are in agreement on this .
this initiative would also benefit the joint discussion on this issue .
i hope that they will think seriously about their actions and support the rapporteur when we vote on this report tomorrow .
i look forward to the report .
there are serious problems with the way in which it is being achieved and also with the nature of the compromise that is being achieved .
for that reason i too am pleased with the approach proposed by the commission .
not all my colleagues , however , have taken such a responsible view of the matter .
thank you very much , mr president .
the debate is closed .
women 's rights are human rights , and this must form the basis of our actions .
now we have come this far , i would like to thank my colleagues who have put in so much effort to draw up a number of new amendments .
this time it concerned the united states .
people only have rights .
many compromise amendments have now been tabled .
that does not exist .
we just have to put up with it , as it were .
they will not do it !
let us think seriously and clearly about all that .
we can and must take action .
our group has tabled amendments , which can improve the report to some extent .
according to the treaty , the european union is a union of independent states .
this proposal is quite specific .
the debate is closed .
mr president , can i do the same if there is a problem ?
this is a new development , and i would ask the public to note the fact .
that is what this proposal is all about .
)
of course , there are rules at national level .
this is not just my own view .
it is the most serious , but not the only effect .
mr president , two things .
the vote is closed .
secondly , you referred to measures to be taken by the european union in such cases .
what is the european commission 's position on this ?
if we call for new instruments , the question we will be asked is this : what are we doing with the existing instruments , and why are they not sufficient ?
when will you do so ?
part i
on the second point , i fully agree with you .
according to the rules of procedure , the same member may not ask further questions .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his response .
it is a global issue and i am sure it is something which we all agree on .
thank you very much , commissioner .
second part
we do not believe in such a system .
would the commissioner be in favour of such a system ?
i have two comments to make in response to this point .
first of all , it is a good idea .
the only question which remains is , when will the provisions of the directive and the law which you mentioned to us start being applied ?
can you tell me what your views are ?
subject : water framework directive
that will have to remain the responsibility of the member states .
thank you for your answer , commissioner .
it will not report for a while yet , as you said .
has the commission agreed that this is not a conflict of interest ?
risk reduction measures in addition to those mentioned above may , if necessary , be proposed in the future .
i agree entirely .
i know that such a debate is taking place in the country i know best and that this is also the case in other countries .
there is a great deal of interest in it .
we must address that .
i therefore support your answer
thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
that is my position here .
i think that this is an entirely fair approach .
we have already made this very clear in the proposal we put forward as part of the article 20 negotiations .
why ?
the reform process , too , is set to continue .
this is not enough .
what is the connection ?
i have tabled an amendment with a view to having this aspect included in the report .
my group will vote for this report , but we will vote against it on a number of individual points .
you see , i come from a country which would have no future without its farmers .
we will vote for this report , but in the areas where we think it does not do justice to our farmers , we will vote against it .
they must set priorities .
i mean in the first place agriculture , but also fisheries .
in our view , there is no doubt that he is .
however , this is not enough .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
if only that were so !
the council of ministers has adopted parliament 's key demands from the first reading .
the common position has come up with a compromise here that i entirely support .
( applause )
let me be quite clear : nothing is being taken away from the consumer .
if only !
is that too much to ask ?
safety must be the main concern .
we do not do this for food either .
parliament made its view heard .
this is wrong , simply wrong !
this is not the case here .
many consumers share this hope .
i do not know what you are talking about .
' and they would be right to do so .
for this reason i support it .
i do not believe that i have seen anything like it before .
you cannot have the one without the other .
that is what my country has had and i believe we can keep it .
( applause from the left )
is this what you really want ?
is this really what you want ?
that really is not the position .
this will be the position after this legislation comes into place .
it is absolutely wrong .
what about that ?
they are in favour of this legislation .
this was made clear during the debate in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i am very pleased to see that the council and the commission are now in agreement with the european parliament on the fundamental principles .
this is therefore a practical way of dealing with this issue .
i myself would really like to see amendments nos 3 and 5 put into effect .
that would be a good way forward and my group would be prepared to support such a move .
that is a fact .
that is precisely what we do not want .
i should like to have a clear set of rules .
but it must then apply to all member states .
i would , however , like to draw attention to one point , and that is amendment no 15 .
thank you for that .
that will take time .
i think , however , that we are going too far in a number of areas .
that is why i tabled my proposal .
i believe amendment no 10 was good , which is why the committee adopted it .
for that reason , we must support amendment no 2 to article 4 .
thank you commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
it cannot act , however , as long as it does not have the power to do so .
as members of parliament , we too should take action in our own countries .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
statement by the president
i hope they will be in a position to take up this offer .
mr president , i should now like to move on to the subject of this first speech , namely the enlargement of the european union .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , let me now turn to the subject of our debate .
that also applies to agricultural policy .
the plan is still in place .
there is of course still much work to be done , as we all know .
i believe this to be the common task of the council , the commission and parliament .
you referred to the need for parliament to give its support in this .
here , above all , what is called for is a responsible approach from our member states .
we are not going along with that .
mr president , the eu convention comes at a very important moment in the life of the european union .
issue itself . in any case , you have already done so , commissioner , and very well too .
i would therefore ask the commission and the council to answer the question of whether special initiatives are being taken with regard to women in the countries concerned .
however , the crucial and fundamental problems are not of course of a political and economic nature .
with all respect for you and your office , i have a request to make .
here it seems to me that there is a lack of information in our countries .
but we should have one priority : to bring the costs of enlargement under control .
nevertheless , it remains the key problem : we need more democracy in europe .
previous progress reports have , unfortunately , had not a word to say about this .
agriculture and rural development still play a central role in these countries and will continue to do so for a long time to come .
not only there , either , might i add !
this does not mean , though , that the common agricultural policy was not in need of reform , both in our own states and in the candidate countries , whether enlargement took place or not .
so what are we doing now ?
we will also have to discuss this if we have special provisions for the cohesion fund .
with that in mind , let us go to work together !
then there is the matter of public opinion .
the people of the candidate countries therefore have nothing positive to expect as regards their vital interests .
mr president , i would like to thank all the honourable members who took the floor .
that is not on !
nor do i at all understand what is the problem with the convention , for example .
why is it that the present candidate countries should not , as new members , already play a full part with equal rights ?
i can tell you that that is quite sufficient .
the debate is closed .
our policy in these matters remains clear : we need to respect the international rules .
mr president , i would like to thank the president-in-office of the council and the commissioner for their comments this morning .
this applies to many things .
the eu needs the united states if things get out of hand , but the united states needs the eu to ensure that things do not get too out of hand .
where do we go from here ?
the next item is the vote .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote :
we welcome them here .
we now continue with the vote .
before the vote :
but we will let your committee look at it .
you can tell me in six months ' time whether i was right or wrong .
( parliament adopted the decision )
before the vote :
this is not a matter i can deal with at the moment .
that is the right place for that question to be raised .
before the vote :
mr president , i ask you to consider what can be done about this .
( applause )
( applause )
i do not think , therefore , that we need further discussion at this point .
before the vote :
you know the rules .
that is the case .
this is found in the committee 's amendment .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that is the issue .
you are right .
?
this is a compromise amendment that would remain as an addition .
that is very kind of you .
and by what right ?
does not this internal market exist today ?
that is why the convention which is going to meet to discuss the future of europe should add this important issue to its agenda .
having said which , we need :
that is not the case .
that right has been taken away from them today .
in whose interests is this to be done ?
the european union 's decisions must also be possible to implement .
we therefore voted against these two reports .
this is why i voted against the report in the final vote .
i will be voting against the proposal .
these are the reasons why we have voted against the report .
this is a fundamental principle .
this is the reason why i voted against the report .
on what authority ?
i believe that it is important to guarantee women 's rights .
i would like the council and commission 's views on them .
we want nothing to do with that particular value .
that is something we are not prepared to accept .
we know why .
our market is open .
commission : take him on .
go for it !
the cause is good .
i would certainly support him in that .
however , this also means that the council needs to consider new initiatives .
therefore , the labour government is not our answer - the commission is .
we must show we mean business .
clearly , in this case too , just as in the last one , we are prepared to use all the legal resources established in the world trade organisation .
and
they simply state it .
why ?
this is my first question .
mr president , i will try to answer some of the questions raised very quickly .
the debate is closed .
but i would also like to say a few additional words about the report .
we should move away from that .
however , at the end of the day it is also important for us to adopt a clear position here .
just a few more words by way of conclusion .
the best form of social policy is a good economic policy .
at what price ?
but how is europe to do this ?
and is europe able to implement policy in those areas ?
this is not the case .
that applies not only to the european parliament but also to the council and the governments of the member states .
that means that we have to increase demand .
demand must come from both public and private investment .
that is unfortunately not what i see .
that is not enough .
where must we go in the long term ?
i completely agree with each of these points .
however , i would like to add one point .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following three reports :
this is why greater transparency is essential .
mr president , commissioner , i would like to thank the rapporteur and in particular the commission .
at the same time , however , there must be no more regulation than is necessary .
thank you for your response .
should he go there within three years , four years or five years ?
could the council meet with them ?
mr president , i am not in a position to answer this question .
but i do think that , as a general rule , the council should answer all questions .
as they deal with the same subject , question nos 2 and 3 will be taken together .
thank you for your reply .
i would like to say to the honourable member that the problems raised are not due to a lack of dialogue .
we are going to move on to the next question .
thank you very much , mr president .
i would like an answer .
mr president , no .
in order to do this , this presidency or the next one will have many opportunities to give their opinion on these issues .
mr president , i shall now answer .
is it true ?
do you know anything about it ?
this european parliament should really draw the attention of the eu governments to this matter .
several members have given up their speaking time , but there is a point of order .
would you like to make a statement ?
i regard the agreement between parliament , commission and council on most of the proposals as a great success .
this is of course a positive move .
i still have a number of concerns about the directive .
the role of the european central bank should also be considered in my view .
i will deal with each issue in turn .
i agree .
i think that parliament would also consider that necessary .
that is the role and responsibility of our public authorities .
i am certain all members are aware that recent events have shown how important those issues are .
i hope that all members present here and those voting tomorrow will agree and adopt that directive .
the debate is closed .
the next item is a joint debate on two reports by the committee on economic and monetary affairs :
as the rapporteur , i support the two amendments .
we all know what a difficult area eu tax coordination is .
in fact , negotiations in this respect are already under way .
the result is a compromise .
therefore we have to live with that .
i only referred to the people of my own country .
the debate is closed .
this will therefore be our first contribution to the convention after it has been set up .
the convention must say who we are and what we want .
i very much support this .
the convention is an excellent opportunity to do this work .
but it is also important for justice and home affairs policy .
the debate is closed .
where are we in this process ?
as a result there is the question of funding .
i think we have too many resolutions and too little debate .
i think this is a good report whose content should be applied .
we will have to look at this in a practical way .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we fully agree with this objective .
first of all , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur , and thank her for the efforts she has made in this field .
could it be that there is a lack of commission strategy in this area ?
what is civil society ?
i agree that there is a need to have a debate on this .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
our thanks are due to them .
they are always there and help us in europe to understand each other better , and to get on better with each other .
that is what we need to put a stop to .
mr president , i will , of course , do my best .
it has been mentioned in the question as well .
the problem is that there are quite a number of serious practical problems that we have to deal with .
his children no longer wish to see him .
they need policies to be implemented .
what european law should we draw up ?
there is certainly a particular place for community law , for law of the members of the european union .
from that point of view , i would like to draw your attention to a few difficulties .
use them .
mr president , i only need to make a few comments .
it will be .
thank you , commissioner , on behalf of all the members present , for your answer .
1 .
2 .
3 .
4 .
5 .
madam president , i must first congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
in my opinion , therefore , we need an answer to the following questions .
the debate is closed .
is that what we are trying to do ?
is that our objective ?
it is , however , the social effects of such measures that give me cause for concern .
however , there are three fundamental points to note .
is this a role of the common agricultural policy ?
the commission has created a new political framework in its communication on a strategy for sustainable development .
funding can be provided for research under the community research policy .
some of the 5 % funds which i referred to will be used for this .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
secondly , environmental measures .
i should like the member states in particular to take good note of that .
this was the opinion of the committee on fisheries , with just one vote against .
the green paper is a clear example of this .
there are four main problem areas .
now to the individual points in your report .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
why a year ?
now to the proposed amendments : amendments nos 1 and 3 concern the legal basis .
however , i can accept amendments nos 4 and 5 . thank you for your attention .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the commissioner might be able to account for this .
now to the individual proposed amendments .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament decided not to vote on the amendment )
does the house agree to put this compromise amendment to the vote ?
( parliament decided not to vote on the amendment )
i have a question , mr president .
when did the ' honourable ' member receive this compromise amendment ?
( parliament adopted the amendment )
however , i call upon the house to decide whether to agree to your request .
once again , i call upon the house to decide whether to put the compromise amendment to the vote .
( parliament decided not to vote on the amendment )
we accept this compromise .
it seems not .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i was therefore very pleased to vote for the motion .
but the treaty does not allow it ' .
mr president , the british labour members did not support this report .
however , support of this kind cannot be provided for ever .
i voted in favour of this report .
to begin with , europe must ensure that environmental legislation is applied .
we must also take action in the areas of agriculture and fisheries .
i voted in favour of this report .
this is absolutely unacceptable !
i did not , however , vote for this joint resolution .
above all , we support workers throughout the world , including those in the united states .
i voted in favour of this report .
?
mr president , we will be voting on a resolution today .
the debate is closed .
we know that the who is in great need of financial aid .
my question to the commission is , are you prepared to support parliament here ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it may be the case , but it is not the policy of the european union .
which is why i think that the european union should do everything it can to create democracy and the conditions for economic development here too .
the commission , together with other partners , will be giving humanitarian requirements a high priority .
( applause )
it seems like a good idea to me .
this is not acceptable , in my view .
i already mentioned that this debate is also an opportunity to say that the european union should do more .
we therefore welcome this resolution by the european union .
but they should know that the european union is on their side on this .
we must apply pressure on the government .
that is certainly true today .
now , there is cause to do so again .
because they themselves have given themselves up , that is only right .
that must not continue .
above all , attention must be given to this case .
i therefore take the view that the current agreement should also be used for dialogue on this issue .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
our main help has been humanitarian .
the joint debate is closed .
our objective is simply to protect something that we have been working on for the community agricultural sector .
as things stand , it would be the best solution .
the joint debate is closed .
the fight against terrorism is a fundamental priority in the european union .
it is in this field , perhaps , where the progress made by the european council has been most relevant .
( applause )
thank you very much , mr president .
( applause )
the coordination of economic policies is a crucial part of this process .
in particular , we need to work on the basis of a set of agreed principles and rules for member states ' budgetary policies .
( applause )
i believe that they provided a good basis for debate .
today is the second time .
we really wanted more than that .
( applause from the right )
the first of these is the reform of the council .
we all stand to benefit from that .
( applause from the right )
but it requires - and this is in the council 's conclusions - better regulation and monitoring .
( applause )
we believe that this is absolutely fundamental .
all that would do is make things difficult for the country .
( applause )
( applause )
we are going to make this a reality .
president , i congratulate you on the success of your first summit as president of this house .
we call on you to do so .
i would like to know the reason for this and i am sure that the matter is of interest to parliament as a whole .
what conclusions would you draw from this ?
we particularly note the call on the commission to draw up a proposal for a framework directive on this subject .
we must be seen as a form of cooperation between independent countries - not as a new state .
thank you very much , mr president , ladies and gentlemen .
( applause )
what can we do to create full employment ?
what has been agreed ?
to achieve 10 % .
what does that mean ?
thank you very much , mr president .
i have two points to make in that respect .
it is therefore a very welcome step .
i hope the house will support it .
you , mr president , were received by the council .
it is tomorrow 's europe .
on a final note , although progress was made at the summit , it did not deal with any key political issues , although this should have been the case .
the same is true of social dialogue .
this also applies to a few more areas .
i should simply like to draw the attention to these concerns once more .
it simply cannot and never will do it .
the commission , council and parliament know what needs to be in a framework document of that kind .
we need to make an effort to put things right .
in effect , the european council has made it possible for progress to be made in the fight against unemployment .
the end result is open coordination .
thank you , mr president .
that is the true civil society .
thank you very much , mr president .
they are different issues .
and there were a few problems .
it is not enough , but it is all we have .
this , however , is certainly not the case .
in russia too the subject is discussed .
there are questions here that we shall be asked to answer .
( applause )
on this point we can only say that we fully agree .
it is also , however , an institutional problem .
mr president , as rapporteur for this year 's budget , i have a number of matters to address in that connection .
that is a matter which must be taken seriously .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the next item is the vote .
as far as we are concerned , we have seen the real situation and we say that a europe , which is not a social europe , is not our own .
well done !
citizens are fundamental to a democracy .
and the reason is that the council has to take a step forward in relation to parliament on the specific issue of the implementation of the foreign and security policy and its monitoring .
( parliament approved the proposal )
this summit will be dealing with a matter that this house has already voted on .
it is an important part of our work .
so she is a little behind the times .
i do not think there is any need for this .
he makes two points .
they are two eu citizens .
article 4 ( 3 ) is of crucial importance .
first of all , the proposal only applies , of course , to eu member states .
and then , what about the others ?
and i believe that specific efforts must be made in order to achieve this .
this is not so , as you well know .
the debate is closed .
that is the first point .
cooperation is the key to success .
it is a necessary measure .
the debate is closed .
the council proposal is an important step in this direction .
the rapporteur should therefore be supported in his efforts to bring about an amendment on this point .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
this is a positive step .
the question remains whether we need a framework council decision for this .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , why are the proposals now put before us so important ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is one which , i am sure , the commission will never accept !
there is your answer .
thank you , commissioner .
the next item is the joint debate on :
that is something we must avoid at all costs .
after all , we also have powers in the field of the budget .
i think that this , in general , is only fair .
it really is time to do more about this issue .
these are serious , practical problems .
the debate is closed .
thank you for your cooperation .
i also believe that this proposal is a necessary step , which requires others in order to make full sense .
that was not to be the case .
allow me to mention a number of important points .
these are people we are dealing with !
it is my hope that the house will be able to support this proposal tomorrow .
it may be a country they have heard of .
there may already be a considerable community of people from their own region in the area .
it might offer work opportunities .
mr president , commissioner , i welcome the commission proposals and support the rapporteur and the report as it was voted on in the committee .
by doing this , you will only promote immigration .
under no circumstances could we accept that .
much in the accession process will be difficult enough for them .
i also wish , of course , to thank the commission for its proposal .
however , we do not have this single system .
the debate is closed .
i have taken note of your comment .
are there any comments ?
your comment will , of course , be included in the minutes .
( the minutes were approved )
this is currently the cause of much public concern in eu member states .
finally , we would ask the commission not to force us to take this kind of action .
are you speaking for or against the request for urgent procedure ?
is there a member to speak in favour of the request for urgent procedure ?
the next item is the joint debate on :
so , there was a problem .
the commission then found a few more reports .
i have still not had an answer to this question .
that is not , i think , something that we can live with in the eu .
that is something we cannot live with .
things are going well , in fact much better , and that is something we can only be pleased about .
madam president , there was a very high level of implementation of the european parliament 's budget for the financial year 2000 .
in my view , cooperation has been excellent this year .
it is a step that we must take .
and this is the first budget for which the new commission is responsible .
this seems to me to be a priority for the year to come .
the ' gentlemen 's agreement ' no longer applies .
people will simply not put up with it . this cannot be the price of cooperation in europe .
this is not the right approach .
there are still some problems , however .
foreign and defence policy are recent issues .
if this is not the case , we will have to vote against the report .
nor can i accept that the commission has had very little or nothing to say on this issue !
so it is relevant to refer to this .
how , then , is that to be done ?
i therefore believe that the committee 's positive efforts call for a positive response on our behalf .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is a key point for us too .
we do , of course , support this idea .
that is our objective .
we therefore hope that we will quickly agree on a common document with the commission , but above all with the council as well .
the text before us today is an important step in this direction .
the commission can fully support the other amendments .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i should like to draw your attention to the following .
why ?
thank you very much .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
tomorrow , therefore , we must vote for this document . '
president .
i really would like to thank the rapporteur .
mr president , i proposed two amendments to this report .
that is why i tabled this amendment and indeed voted for it .
why is that ?
it is certainly right to think of others , but the others include ourselves ! '
mr president , this house has this morning approved the minutes of yesterday 's sitting .
in the first place , what i mentioned was not raised by the president .
i was not able to do that .
that is an important contribution .
i want to thank the minister of the council .
i referred to a second area , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , which is the institutional field .
to this end , the council is of essential importance .
thank you very much , mr president .
if necessary , we will go it alone , we hear them say .
this is what we have the united nations for , and the eu must help make a policy possible .
unfortunately , this is still not the case .
thank you .
however , there are three aspects which i do not agree with and which may be crucial :
this issue was the subject of a recent debate and statement in this house .
we want the commission to move forward .
why only a third ?
what does europe actually want from its defence policy ?
part of this is that the rules of europe 's internal market need to be applied more in this field .
i should like to put my second question to both the minister and the commissioner .
it seems to me that this needs to be done .
quite right !
so progress is being made .
even more important is , in fact , the lack of return on our efforts .
? in this role . that goes without saying .
i am not sure what .
if only such things could be heard every day and in every parliament .
but i cannot go any further into this issue .
our union , if i may put it this way , is based on law .
and finally we will have to think - and why not ?
the commission will continue to follow this line .
i cannot answer as to whether or not he is able to give you a reply .
we must not be part of the problem , but rather part of the solution to the problem .
mr president , these military actions are not the right way to put an end to terrorism .
( applause )
i have had the opportunity to speak to them .
( applause )
( applause )
how have we come to this ?
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
this must be the objective of all of us , and that objective must be achieved soon .
( applause )
( applause )
they expect so much from europe .
that is all well and good .
mr president , i come from a country in which terrorism is the main concern of the citizens and we therefore feel particular solidarity with its victims .
there can be no such balance .
what can we do ?
a great deal , i believe .
the eu too must do more , however .
we must do everything in our power to stop this violence .
when does the eu plan to say that enough is enough ?
i wish you all every success tomorrow .
words alone , however , are not enough !
you know what i mean .
i believe that we must begin to think seriously about it .
that is what we must do .
that is the final objective .
how can that objective be achieved ?
that is the difficult question that we have been working on for many months .
( applause )
we must understand all of this .
( applause )
( applause )
the debate is closed .
first of all , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work . like him i believe that we are working towards an excellent text .
we share many of your concerns and we accept all the amendments you have tabled .
the debate is closed .
i believe we have achieved this .
nevertheless , it is a good result .
i regard that as a good proposal .
mr president , i thank you for this opportunity , and i thank you all for your attention .
i agree very much with the three points she wanted us to focus on , although on one i take a different view .
the union should pay for that .
this is one of our priorities .
so what is the current situation ?
everything has been said and a compromise has , i think , been reached .
moreover , european industry has called for this .
this is a compromise solution .
here two different issues are involved .
that is the first issue .
therefore a debate on this question should be carried out in that context and not in this .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i am often asked why we need a directive of this kind .
that just cannot be right .
i hope that you will agree with me .
i cannot do anything about it either !
no , we are not .
no , we do not .
not yet .
i must say , i am not in favour of this .
this is new .
that does not work .
we have one market and we thus need one system for the whole of europe .
two of these are of particular concern to me .
but are these proposals going to help us ?
furthermore , are parliament 's amendments going to make things better ?
there must be common systems in which the principles of the market economy apply .
mr president , i welcome this directive and thank the rapporteur for his hard work .
consumers need to be involved in this process in order for the directive to be a success .
however , individual funding is not the answer .
let me also answer some of the points raised during the debate .
i thank all members for this important debate .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we will of course also support amendments nos 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .
there is absolutely no question about that fact .
for the moment it is an open question .
so how quickly is it prepared to act ?
the debate is closed .
there should be no doubt about this .
more must be done here .

the european parliament has adopted quite a number of resolutions on this conflict but , now , action is required .
we will go together .
and we will try to take action at long last .
terrorism does not come about of itself .
it is not like that in this case .
we should make it our concern .
this is why our resolution is full of questions .
and if the situation could be different , they would be in favour of it .
conflict goes on for years .
we need a political resolution , but russia must be held to account .
the fact remains that it has not yet had any effect .
( applause )
we should support this .
at that time his purpose was not to fight terrorism .
we must not stand for this any longer .
we are all prepared to support this proposal .
this is not a war on terrorism .
we are both members of the council of europe .
we must not stand for this any longer !
all this is very positive : it means that we will , at least , be present .
once again , we will not be able to say that we could not help .
mr president , let me again stress that we are present in the region .
thank you , commissioner .
i will now comment on the amendments .
i am therefore in favour of amendment no 10 .
it is also a process within our reach , because it is our responsibility .
i should like to focus on an aspect i believe to be of fundamental importance , namely political dialogue .
it has the resources that are needed .
how can it better be used to guarantee a common area of peace and stability ?
the european commission has put forward a set of new proposals .
the debate is closed .
we shall now take the next item .
it is and remains the state which is called upon here .
i do not think that is acceptable .
your point is clear , well made and well taken .
the commission cannot accept amendment no 3 .
at first reading , the report was adopted by a large majority of this house .
however , it was not possible for the council to accept our amendments on the legal framework at that stage .
i should also like to thank the people in the commission responsible .
this is amendment no 4 .
the services are aware of that and if the amendment is adopted the appropriate changes will be made .
" that is the addition and it is also in the voting list .
( applause from the right )
i would ask you to take note of this at least !
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )

we had the debate yesterday .
so let us move to the vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i voted for the motion today and i was in favour of this report when i voted for it in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy too .
1 .
2 .
3 .
i am very pleased with that .
there is no mention of the interests of europe or its member states .
on a number of points , i do not however share the rapporteur 's view .
on a number of points , i do not however share the rapporteur 's view .
i therefore voted against the resolution .
they will be talking about increasing economic cooperation between russia and germany .
we must act quickly .
there is no reason not to be fair .
by no means .
and there are a lot of them !
that will continue .
that is not acceptable .
this would not be the first time .
this is unacceptable .
we do not support this .
we agree with this .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it is extremely important that we do this first .
i call on the member states to give due consideration to this point .
this is an important aspect of the action plan for financial services .
do something , council !
and this is why this report is so important , in my view .
this is , in fact , another cause of my concern .
it must , of course , be the right form of directive that we adopt .
mr president , i also would to thank our rapporteur .
i would agree with much of what has already been said in this debate .
new resources must therefore be found .
the report certainly has good points .
how should this be done ?
we therefore hope that the proposals we tabled are approved so as to improve the content of the report .
but we have given that commitment .
but that alone is not enough .
there is an important point to be made here .
no , that is not enough .
indeed there are !
indeed there is !
the debate is closed .
we hope that the commission and the council will take account of these efforts .
workers must be clear about how to protect themselves and others .
this is not very responsible .
that too i see as being necessary .
i would like to congratulate the house on the quality of its amendments .
the answer , unfortunately , is clear : no , it cannot .
it is one of the main issues of discussion between the commission and the council .
the debate is closed .
you have the floor .
mr president , you will find that it is a very real point of order .
could i ask if that is the situation ?
i shall give the floor to you all , but i must ask you to ?
if i had had the opportunity yesterday to put these questions , i would have done so .
the council cannot give an answer .
i should like to thank the president-in-office for his response .
i know it is difficult to come back to this question again and again .
subject : community programme for environmental education
in your priorities for the european council presidency you said that education would play a major role .
the reason i asked this question , however , is precisely because it is really urgent .
i think it is time , and the matter is urgent now , to implement provisions and practical initiatives .
i also think the time is just right .
i think it would , mr president-in-office of the council , and i would ask him to do this .
i would thank the president-in-office of the council for his answer .
this is not a point of order .
i do not think this is too hard to understand .
his report is one that we welcome .
these promote the further development of new technology .
in particular , we will have need of that when it comes to the new member states .
perhaps i may mention four of them .
progress has been made but much remains to be done .
we therefore once again accept the fact that those three amendments will be approved by parliament .
the debate is closed .
the end result is always the same : nothing is done .
we have to continue with things as they are .
this concern , though , has not been taken into account either .
the concerns of farmers and of the rural areas as a whole matter to me .
the commission is working on that .
i thank them for the time they have given to this proposal .
the debate is closed .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , who presented those of parliament 's amendments that had not been taken up by the council in its common position .
for them , we need money .
we must increase the means available to these organisations .
so what should we do in the eu ?
we need to do more .
so many thanks for it .
i would like to again go over the three points that i see as being the most important .
mr president , i would also like to add my thanks to the rapporteur for his work on this very important report .
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
as the report states , progress has already been made in a very short time .
our approach , therefore , is extremely practical .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we all know that the issue of training is of great importance for the coming years .
this is certainly very important for developing countries .
a society must be supported by its citizens .
this report is about cooperation with third countries .
finally , i should like to focus on the importance this has for development cooperation .
it is very important for parliament and the commission to work side by side .
this is precisely the subject of the report before us .
we are making progress , ladies and gentlemen , by taking specific action .
well , that is what we are in the process of doing .
but we think that these are the institutions that should do this .
and i am not even talking about education ministers because often it is social security ministers or home office ministers who need to get involved here .
we are however making progress here too .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the approach adopted by the commission is based on three points :
that is why , mr president , i call upon the house to give its full support to the resolution we are to vote on today .
however , that is not the case today .
before the vote :
therefore , i would ask members to vote against the legislative proposal , so that it can be referred back to the commission .
thank you , commissioner .
in that case the matter is referred back to committee .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that right should also apply to human rights issues .
i therefore call upon the council to take into consideration the amendments adopted by parliament , at least , and to make the necessary changes to the proposal for a regulation .
the fight against terrorism is crucial and has our support .
that is especially important in the fight against terrorism .
we now hope that the commission and the council will accept parliament 's proposals .
the commission cannot provide financial assistance : all it can do is support a process , as it does with open coordination .
this would have been more than enough .
everyone is aware of this .
i have not therefore been able to vote in favour of the report .
for all of these reasons , we voted against the report .
for these reasons , i voted against this report .
we must act , and act together .
we find them unacceptable .
the joint debate is closed .
this is great progress and we should encourage it .
the joint debate is closed .
it is therefore extremely difficult to set up local development programmes .
that is the commission 's position .
that is the first measure .
this situation is unacceptable .
there are also very serious environmental and other consequences .
this is unacceptable .
what does this document say ?
it is a human rights issue that we are discussing here .
we need to work towards a common european asylum system .
of course , it would also help if parliament took a stand .
i hope that this sitting will not be just another meeting .
europe has a very important part to play .
the joint debate is closed .
in a word , it could bring its people back to life .
we are prepared to support the organisation of elections as soon as local conditions allow .
the strategy in the long term is currently being discussed both with the government and civil society and at commission and union level .
the joint debate is closed .
therefore , we would ask the commission to show solidarity and we ask the commissioner what can be done in this regard .
the joint debate is closed .
the next item is the order of business
thank you very much , mr president .
despite all of this , however , this progress , though important , is not sufficient .
what are these principles ?
i would also like to express my serious concern about the humanitarian crisis .
i must point out that they share that concern and i am aware that they are taking measures .
they are doing so and they are doing it very well .
a peace conference cannot start from nothing .
( applause )
much remains to be done .
we also agreed to step up our financial cooperation .
( applause )
( applause )
that is what it means to be a democratic society ; that is what the rule of law means .
( applause )
i want to make four points :
( applause )
( applause )
for the moment the focus must be on humanitarian aid .
( applause )
( applause )
this must stop .
( applause )
this must be of great concern to the members of this house .
that is why we have so much more to do in those areas than we have done in the past .
( applause )
that is what we have called for .
that is why development in these countries must be a success .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
what can we do ?
there is a need for a new peace conference , but there is also a need for new people to take part in this .
the rule of law must return to the area .
what about us though ? are we doing enough ?
i would therefore like to ask this question : are we doing enough ?
this is true .
the elections in europe have shown us this .
( applause )
to achieve peace , we must do more .
and why not ?
it is up to us , the international community , to think how to guarantee the security of both .
two states , both have peace , both have security .
are we doing enough ?
( applause )
( applause )
this is what i am saying .
( applause )
we do not know what happened to them .
there will no longer be just a few difficult days to get through .
each side must give up something .
we must do something to give the young people of the region the hope , at last , of a future of peace and security .
the least that can be asked is that the council and the commission ensure that the demand is carried out in practice .
to this end , we call for the un resolutions to be implemented .
we must use the instruments available to us too .
we do not want to hear once again , mr president , that europe must have a foreign policy .
if that is not a lack of respect for human life , i do not know what is .
we know how many of them are children .
i hope we do not .
he does not take them seriously !
have we , then , done enough in this situation ?
i do not think so .
i have a few direct questions for you , minister .
what do you mean by that ?
i have no doubt about that at all .
there are many other conditions we could perhaps apply .
i welcome the fact that the fight against terrorism and the fight against drugs were discussed .
does this parliament want such a bank ?
do certain members of the council ?
what are we , as the european union , going to propose ?
how can the eu help ?
they want peace now .
the debate is closed .
the presidency takes note of the point of order you have made .
in fact , these guidelines also form the basis for a programme document in which priority is given to the european initiative for democracy and human rights .
why ?
these are general points , but there are some specific points that we cannot support .
why ?
we need to be global .
that is the reality .
few of these proposals become a reality .
a single committee for citizens ' and human rights is , however , an excellent idea that we support .
we have not done that .
it is not enough to know ' who ' . we must also know ' why ' .
we have problems with our policy in the eu .
this initiative has been a success .
so , colleagues , let us take an interest again .
what is certain , though , is that crime , too , has become public .
this is not true .
it is to that part of the report that i now turn .
the debate is closed .
the council and one or two members are concerned about the amendments that we have tabled .
if that is the case , we could do something about it later on .
there are other consequences .
they are right .
over the last three years we had kosovo , where we really had to fight hard to end up with any money at all .
that would , for a start , be another way of going about things .
it is difficult to put decisions into effect .
the commission must therefore really make more of an effort .
the other five or ten countries coming into the european union will demand structural funding for their countries .
)
the debate is closed .
this is why i am pleased with this commission communication .
these three points , and particularly the last one , are extremely important .
we have not been able to achieve equal pay for the same jobs .
that is something we cause them to believe .
my group will support the report .
i think that this is our future .
we know that it is very difficult .
it is of course precisely the same as in the eu member states .
however , we need to do more .
there really have to be some changes here .
let me point out that various measures have been set in motion in this area as well .
i hope to be able to give you further information and reports on the international women 's day next year .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
' .
we have done the right thing .
later in the year , i shall return with a report that will take the work further in the same direction .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
why is that the case ?
it is the same principle which we have just been talking about with regard to employment policy and which can perhaps also be used within the working environment .
however , having said that , i am very pleased that we have reached an agreement .
the first step has now been taken and brought to its conclusion .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
therefore , i ask you to take note of this , if parliament takes this approach .
mr president , i thank the rapporteur for his work in this area .
this is unacceptable .
it is in this context that this change should be seen .
the debate is closed .
i do not feel that this fact has been taken into due consideration either .
i think that , in this area , we must make every possible effort .
( applause from the left )
that we do not want !
that is not the policy that we support .
social protection is therefore included .
my second point concerns education .
this is of major importance .
the issue we are discussing is extremely serious .
the rapporteur is right : this is no longer his report .
( applause from the right )
i would now like to make some comments on the report and on the amendments to the proposed directive that are under discussion today .
firstly , there are technical amendments which improve the text and which the commission can therefore accept as a matter of course .
thank you , commissioner .
we shall do as you have asked .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
the developing countries must have access to our markets so that they themselves can create the basis for their economic progress .
it is very important for us to take a longer policy view of the situation already at this stage .
that will not come about if we carry on as before ; rather , we too are called upon to change our approach here too .
thank you , commissioner .
this is why we do not believe that it goes without saying that as much money as possible should be given to the european union .
mr president , our group was extremely pleased at the result of the vote this morning .
i am sure that is something that will also change .
we are discussing human rights in the european union .
we often say , mr president , that we want to promote human rights in third countries .
that is right and we are doing what we can , but i feel that we are not doing enough .
let us take some practical action at last ! enough of words , words , words !
in my view , the next french government should be concerned by this .
that is why our report on the report from the commission does indeed have a purpose .
that is precisely the basis of our democratic system .
president .
i shall do that on behalf of the house .
this has a serious impact on another member state .
perhaps you could let me know .
( applause )
mr president , this is a question of respect for human rights .
unfortunately not yet .
this too will need to be provided for .
and i will certainly make this point at the convention on the future of europe , of which i am a member .
we must ourselves be as open as possible .
there is , of course , a lot more to be done , however .
this is a key point .
we all of us know that there is no democracy without transparency .
the debate is closed .
it should be said that some member states already implement this measure .
that is simply not on .
i therefore hope that we take a different decision tomorrow .
it is , in our view , important that an amendment is once again tabled on this subject .
it is important .
we believe that that would provide the appropriate balance .
the aim of the rapporteur 's amendment no 20 is to increase security .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we wanted to be prepared at any time for the common position .
many of her changes also had to be adopted by the council and the commission .
it must be said that our group - and i hope many colleagues will agree with us - has tabled a number of crucial amendments to this directive .
but what do we find ?
i ask you , on behalf of the group , to support those amendments .
this directive will improve the working of the single market and offer consumers greater protection .
the council , on the other hand , took a completely different view .
i would now just mention here that any directive , for example , in response to parliament 's demands , would apply to all consumers and not only those that live in the member states .
why ?
the european commission was in agreement with this .
we voted in favour of this .
the crucial point is clearly article 3 ( 4 ) .
i will give one reason why i call for this .
we therefore ask you to adopt our amendments .
do they understand it ?
among these , article 3 ( 4 ) is central .
i expect you will , however , wish to put a question to the commissioner .
mr president , you have just said that this is a debate , but this was not a debate .
good .
the debate is closed .
a number of the european parliament 's amendments were already adopted at first reading - we are now discussing the second reading .
however , on the whole , we should be pleased that we have reached this point .
clearly we still have a lot of work to do .
this is a step in the right direction .
i welcome the compromise reached between parliament , the council and the commission .
that is not acceptable .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the policy should take this point very much into consideration .
the european parliament and the commission clearly do not see matters in this light .
what are their reasons for this ?
if you were the minister , commissioner , what would you have done ?
you would have put health first .
the commission in general can go along with the draft report .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i think that this is what is most important .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
such a thing cannot be had for free .
on behalf of my group , i ask you to support it when we vote tomorrow .
this is seen especially in the extent to which young people take part in elections at national and european level .
more to the point , what does the policy of the european union have to offer ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thus we have been very successful in some programmes .
we have not done as the commission said in every respect .
we hope , of course , that the commission will support us in this .
the council is against it .
of course , we do not always have to tell the council that , but we do have money .
i really cannot understand why they do not want us to !
we should take it as our example .
what will be in the programme to address this ?
that is my first point and i would like to thank you for having shown such commitment .
this is the purpose of my amendment , which i would like to come back to , as i think that this is a very important point .
i think that we must stress this point in the report .
i would , therefore , like us to stress this point .
why was it successful ?
i think that this would be in everyone 's interest .
thank you for your help .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
you know full well that there are rules which apply .
( the minutes were approved )
this is an urgent and important matter , but it is one on which , until now , no community action has been taken .
therefore , i call on the house to vote against this request for urgent procedure .
i therefore put the motion to the vote .
parliament 's dialogue with the european central bank on monetary affairs has made a real contribution to this .
price stability is the task , cause and objective of the european central bank 's policy .
together with the council , we have made the right decision .
we wish him every success .
the debate is closed .
i am extremely pleased about that .
we will give them the money to do work which will help our economy and our society .
this is one part of the european research area .
it is their responsibility .
the european union is doing its part .
at the moment , there is no real european research area .
i should like to draw the attention to this aspect once again .
? he second point which concerns us is where the money will end up .
that is why this issue demands that amendments be tabled and resolutions adopted .
this will not happen again .
i would like to thank parliament and the council for their commitment .
we must continue with these efforts .
the debate is closed .
that is very small - less , indeed , than in previous years .
this is an increase over the previous year .
let me also point out that a very large number of new measures have been adopted .
thank you very much !
( applause )
that is , in fact , progress .
we are agreed that we must now put enlargement first .
the problem is of crucial importance and it needs to be discussed .
in conclusion , i want to say something about the longer term future .
these are the reform of agricultural and fisheries policy , on the one hand , and the real costs of enlargement , on the other .
let us begin this discussion in time .
there are , however , three points that still remain of concern to us .
so what did encourage people to go out and vote ?
i am also extremely concerned about how the institutions are going to deal with proposals for funding the administrative costs .
this fact alone has a major impact on costs .
it is important to give more support to this basic work .
one of these is enlargement and the other , assistance to members .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we need competition in products and competition in systems !
the union 's budget and the european investment bank must be used .
we need public funding that is sufficient to meet these needs .
what , then , can we hope for in such a situation ?
you can speak your mind , but you also have to back up your words by action .
before the vote :
indeed , mr president , i would rather you did not call them to order !
we have come a long way since then .
the fight goes on .
why is that ?
however , i should like to add the following :
why did i vote for the report , mr president ?
the costs , however , are not only financial .
so do i .
obviously , changes need to be made .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen , and , in particular , thank you very much , mr president .
you have mentioned some progress and i will return to that .
you tell me that there have been results .
i would like to ask you what they are .
what does the council think of their content given the way they have been presented by the commission ?
" .
you on the left - your policy is not accepted .
that is something we do not need !
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
i believe that this is the council 's position on this issue .
thank you , minister .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on
we will take note of the progress made since then and establish new objectives for our relations .
i will now comment on russia 's accession to the world trade organisation .
but what about content ?
the presidency referred to the importance of the environment in our dialogue .
thank you , commissioner .
madam president , thank you for your kind words .
thank you very much , commissioner .
many thanks for giving me a few minutes ' speaking time .
thank you very much indeed !
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
just five points , ladies and gentlemen .
i do not understand .
no , what we need to measure is real results .
we should take an interest in the future of the people who live there .
many thanks and i wish her all the best .
a joint action plan also needs a joint fund .
the presidency takes the same view .
these relations are as they are and not as we would like them to be .
a justice council and a home affairs council have been held .
thank you very much .
instead , i will focus on more recent developments .
what programmes do you think would help to get these problems under control again ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
part i
then we shall take the point of order , because , at the moment at any rate , everything is quite in order .
perhaps the president of the commission might be asked to make a statement on this matter .
you should really be aware of this and show some solidarity .
there will be another time to debate fisheries policy .
nevertheless , the commission 's own initiatives have done a great deal to encourage dialogue between the member states on this problem .
this is the general principle .
i should like to thank the commissioner for his clear response .
second part
commissioner , the commission alone is responsible for this , not the members states .
i thank him for his response .
this is absolutely essential .
this is the approach that we are taking .
it is very important .
these are problems for society .
we must not focus the problems on this aspect alone .
will the commission also provide information on the situation in the member states ?
various eu programmes have made an important contribution towards this .
mr president , i have one comment and one question .
but what are we doing ?
we cannot speak for them .
but my question was more specific than your reply .
on the other hand , they may not .
that was my specific question .
every word i used was important .
so why not in the eu ?
i shall make two points .
i believe that it is absolutely essential .
i have two further comments on what was said this morning .
the joint debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on three reports :
parliament will not agree to any change here .
however , in this case i believe that rather too much use is made of the committee procedure .
in addition , i have included two new proposals in my report .
i hope that will be taken into account .
however , in reality , many small companies have still not been able to put this into practice .
we have made a great deal of progress over the past two years .
we must ask ourselves whether this is the way forward .
it is therefore important .
i certainly hope it will work out that way .
i would like to focus on three points , in particular .
i am pleased to note that there is strong support for the proposal , with only a small number of amendments .
i therefore cannot agree to amendment no 12 .
the joint debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following two reports :
naturally , the commission 's initiative in both reports was also welcome .
i shall talk first of all about the monitoring directive .
these are matters of great importance for all eu states .
of course , this is not just a problem in europe .
to ensure their successful implementation we need to allow sufficient time for member states to meet these objectives .
the majority of the amendments are technical and improve the proposals .
i can accept most of the amendments on this proposal .
the joint debate is closed .
far greater progress can be made with these .
the debate is closed .
we hope that this step forward will lead to the development of a common approach to world issues .
and secondly , what results do we expect from the summit ?
let me move on to my second main question : what does the commission expect from the summit ?
we must use them , not just talk about them !
the commission , together with the member states , has made a great contribution to this .
we naturally have to do more than that and that is why we are so involved in the issue of economic development .
thank you , president-in-office .
the next item is the joint debate on :
what then are the concerns ?
my report is very clear on this .
secondly , economic concerns .
what then should we do ?
what does this mean ?
this is a very , very difficult situation to deal with .
the consequences are considerable .
the question is : what can we do ?
how can we do that ?
and we shall welcome it on parliament 's part .
the war on terrorism comes first .
that is in the nature of how we see the world and of our experience .
two : the eu should further develop its strong points in areas where it has been successful in the past .
the question , then , is what role the eu is to play in relation to the united states .
this is thanks to the power of the community approach .
in my opinion , this is an important position in the report .
mr president , i wish to begin by taking this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
the independent member states of the european union continue to make their own decisions .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
amendment no 1 :
thank you all !
we will now continue with the vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
it is important to point out in parliament today that it is more than just about a market and trade connection .
i give you the floor , mr president .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for giving me the floor today .
( applause )
this is not his problem .
we have , therefore , not voted for this report .
that is unacceptable .
that too is research .
i have voted against the report .
community resources must benefit all countries .
why is that ?
this is how europe needs to be close to the citizens , mr president !
i , for my part , would like to point out that :
that is not true , as we are all aware .
we do not share this view .
which is the more important for democracy ?
in other words , more of the same !
i cannot vote in favour of such a report .
i am sure you will understand that i could not be with you .
we know that reform is difficult .
but reform there must be .
we are already doing a great deal , in other words .
that is not , however , what we are here to discuss .
violence is no solution .
there can be no peace as long as they continue .
a few words about the conference .
it is good that a conference is to take place .
this is not the first conference .
what should actually be on the agenda , then ?
there is no agreement here .
yet it is important to try to draw up a common basic agenda .
i believe it is absolutely crucial for us to do everything in our power to support that initiative .
let us therefore get to work .
that is what we are trying to do .
i believe the time has come for a short process and a long peace .
they will all be necessary .
it is not going to do so .
the debate is closed .
there are many other things to do in relation to the reform of the council , which will no doubt be on the agenda of the convention and the agenda of the intergovernmental conference .
there have already been some amendments , but they were , to say the very least , far from being enough .
that is the convention 's work on the future of the union .
however , the reform of the council is not only necessary for the council itself : it is also necessary for the other institutions and for the union itself .
( applause )
it means that everyone is equal .
.
that is a matter for the convention .
that is of fundamental importance .
that is also well and good .
others will not .
that was an important step forward , but we must go that step further and actually meet in public .
i am sure we would and i hope we would .
the debate is closed .
all of this must be done .
i could not agree with you more .
which countries are they ?
you must ask specific questions .
that is not really a question .
this has not been the practice to date and i do not think it will become the practice in future .
we will have time , however , to discuss this at the appropriate moment .
these are the two questions and i shall answer both .
a bank , however , is also an instrument , of course , with which to help countries to better understand how to make use of financial resources .
that is not what i want to see but it is the will of the european parliament .
the answer i received has much to say about agreements .
therefore , i believe that the less we deal with this issue , the better .
if he does agree , will he do something about it ?
this is all i can say in this regard .
this situation is too serious for the president-in-office of the council to say that nothing can be done .
therefore , current legislation must be applied .
according to the rules of procedure , this is not possible .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this debate is a first .
yet this is also a good time to debate this report , because it is extremely important .
not at all .
all this is well presented in the report .
the states are responsible for what is not given to the union .
that is a very important point .
that is to say , that decisions are taken at the most appropriate level for them .
why ?
what this means is that we are in a position to continue the european union 's development in line with what is needed .
( applause )
i hope we can get a specific proposal in that very area .
the market , currency , freedom of movement - these are not enough .
' .
secondly , the three levels : union , member states , regions .
we could have done more .
let me , though , make just two comments on it .
however , much more will remain the same .
this will certainly take place , because the citizens demand more europe .
i believe there are some problems .
yet , our response is to offer them more of the same .
in any case , i think the regions are an important subject .
the debate is closed .
with such a situation , what can the european parliament offer ?
we need to think how different iraq could be .
what is different ?
we see the future for iraq , and i call upon this house to support the report .
war is not a solution .
there must be no war .
any assessment of the situation in iraq is of course difficult for two reasons .
there is no doubt about that .
what we need to discuss are the policies to be applied .
but then there are the side effects which we do not discuss here .
particular attention is rightly given to human rights in iraq .
the debate is closed .
that i do not believe !
we know that .
there are no end of things to do , though .
but in the case before us now there is not just one issue - it is the fundamental issue .
the debate is closed .
why do we need this initiative ?
what are we working towards ?
each member state is to be able to decide whether to accept this system or not .
what is at issue is respect for the member states that have decided in favour of these systems .
that is what this proposal for a directive is about .
i should like to give an example .
there may also be a question of the legal basis .
a further consideration is the commission 's commitment to better regulation .
and so say all of us .
the debate is closed .
sustainable development
the first item is the joint debate on the following reports :
so what should we be doing ?
it is this management that will , i think , be the main problem in the future .
the european union will be able to play a part for quite some time to come , but not for ever .
and if it is going to play its part , it needs to put its own house in order .
it needs to do more to promote environmental protection and social cohesion policies .
what does this mean ?
this is what i wanted to say , mr president .
political priorities need to be set .
we have had enough words . what we need now is action .
there are two main reasons .
other colleagues have made very many important points relating to the summit .
it is high time we did something about this .
and at the moment , people are particularly concerned with issues such as security and health .
madam president , today we have before us reports that are among the most important this week .
i should like to make two points .
i look forward to your answer .
global economy requires global rules .
we certainly want to make the best use of this opportunity .
this is not certain .
this has to be discussed .
i could not agree more .
the reform of these two areas is as important as any other contribution by europe to global development , as far as international consequences are concerned .
this is needed .
the debate is closed .
what should the commission do ?
i should like to make two other points .
i do not think so .
it is a fundamental human right .
a greater effort is what is required here .
a further key point will be the approach to , and management of , water resources .
i agree .
he mentioned both the european union and the united states and the agricultural policies here as part of the global problem .
once again , i could not agree more .
" these are strong words .
clearly , we in europe need to draw the right conclusions .
( applause )
' .
amendment no 2 :
that means something different .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote :
two days ago there was a new united nations security council resolution on iraq .
i would vote against amendment no 12 .
is that acceptable ?
( parliament adopted the resolution )
for this reason , i have voted against this report .
we do not at all share the views presented in this report .
it is for these reasons that the least we can do is to vote against the report .
let us hope so !
mr president , we may not be many , but i am sure we are good !
we shall not get far if we do not put our own house in order first .
the eu and its member states are making significant use of resources in matters of development .
here we have a different situation .
what is our responsibility as a result ?
i see that is not the case .
i agree completely .
i will come back to this .
on the question of the development of a single policy , we have an overall development cooperation policy statement .
we are very pleased with that .
we have never had anything like this before .
however , reality can be different .
this has not always been the case .
this is a very important , and also a very real , aspect .
the debate is closed .
i know what he is going to say , as the issue has been raised before .
we see that it is taking time .
commissioner , perhaps i could look first at the two issues concerning the rules of procedure .
this will make it possible for them to make better use of us .
that is a real problem .
our colleagues cannot understand why we are so difficult to work with .
this is why we have asked member states for the changes in my area of work .
so we must keep our aid and cooperation programmes in place .
the joint debate is closed .
we must support the efforts of these authorities .
no mean task for the council and the commission , in fact .
the joint debate is closed .
the joint debate is closed .
in other words , i could have just asked the others this time .
i think food should always be provided , no matter what .
there may also be another way .
when ?
where did the money come from ?
we have to ensure that this is the basis of our decisions .
how were they able to do that ?
that is how it has to be done .
that may not be the case .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
you are very welcome .
i want to thank them for their efforts and again say how welcome they are in this house today
that is all i have to say .
( applause )
mr president , two points .
you just have to agree at some point on what it is you want .
we are prepared to discuss it one way or the other .
)
that is what i am saying !
agreed ?
agreed !
i do not , moreover , think that a report is sufficient .
it must be our task to ensure that there are .
which is why i shall say no more .
we call for a vote on our motion .
( the order of business was thus established )
he must have heard me and he did hear me .
the next item is the commission statement on the common fisheries policy .
i have often been asked how it can have come to this .
the future fisheries policy needs clear objectives .
we also want to promote dialogue at international level , especially between the european union and the countries with which we have fisheries agreements .
( applause )
( applause )
the real problem is a social one .
in conclusion , i believe that these commission proposals are just that .
mr president , this is not reform , as the commission itself points out .
they cannot exist side by side .
this is not acceptable .
you have not done this .
what is required here is a balance .
why are the other fisheries nations not involved ?
are they not wanted ?
i hope that everyone speaking on fisheries here today and tomorrow is up for integration .
i look forward to the next six months .
for that , more time is needed .
this does not add up .
that is what everyone is saying .
do you know where the money we need is going to come from ?
is this what you call sustainable development ?
however , there was not much we could do about that .
we all know that .
we must develop a policy that will work .
we cannot deal with every point here today .
we might like to do so , but we cannot .
finally , commissioner , i would like to put the point to you which i put in committee last week .
are you going to get them from the structural funds ?
that is the important thing .
i hope the house will support me on that .
but before i do , i have a request .
and we need to work together on that .
we need a common fisheries policy , one policy for all the member states .
they have been for the last year .
let us not get carried away here !
( applause )
what does this mean ?
the debate is closed .
this proposed reform is , in my view , of real importance , including to european competition policy .
the majority in parliament is in favour of this proposal .
the committee responsible was able to include some of what we in the committee on legal affairs and the internal market proposed in one form or another .
and we shall do so .
mr president , this draft regulation is very important .
i do not believe that this is true .
not now , not ever .
it is crucial .
it should not be .
i think there is no need to stress out about the review .
i would like to thank the members for this dialogue .
this agreement will allow those of us who share the same principles and values to deal with the main issues on the international agenda .
if this is the case , things will move forward .
much remains to be done in the area of trade .
we must not let them down .
i have in mind in particular the protection of fundamental rights , economic cooperation , and the fight against terrorism and drugs .
perhaps the commission could make a contribution here too .
that is what the commission has proposed over and over again in the last few years .
i think the dialogue should give more attention to that .
it is for each one to guarantee the safety of its citizens .
finally , a council decision would bring the role of the court of justice into line with that which has been provided for in the amsterdam treaty .
thank you very much , commissioner .
on that much we can agree .
the question has been put to us , and this is our answer .
this is true in all areas , including internal affairs policy and internal security .
having given our full support , we now , though , expect the council to make its move .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i will close with one last point .
consumer confidence and the quality of agricultural products are important principles in the agriculture of today .
we must make ourselves clear on this issue , however .
we have to take into account what is going on in the world around us .
it is on this basis that the common agricultural policy must be developed further .
i think they can .
the european rural policy should consider these problems too .
but just what does society expect ?
only then will the commission be in a position to make any proposals .
thank you commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
on what ?
but no !
and why ?
in order to reach a compromise ?
has the fight against terrorism been mentioned ?
no , we do not !
if you do not like them , i have others ?
moreover , i am of the opinion that the compromise that these two groups have reached concerning data protection is not such a good one .
i place my hope in the european convention in this respect .
this is quite a while ago now .
in fact , i cannot understand how the commission can back the council proposal .
but there is no war .
this is our major common need and our aim .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is the aim of the proposed directive under discussion today .
there is nothing wrong with the amendment in itself .
all these are very important .
mr president , commissioner , we all agree that information is a basic principle of democracy .
i hope that our british colleagues and other groups will be able to see this as a compromise proposal and that they will also vote for it tomorrow .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
why do we need this particular proposal ?
we do this , however , on a number of very specific conditions .
however , i do want to take this opportunity to make another point .
i should like to bring three important points to your attention .
why am i so concerned about this ?
first , to ensure greater transparency .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it is an action programme .
the hard work is , however , only just beginning , especially for the commission .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it has taken us a long time to reach this stage .
that is not acceptable .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
my final question , commissioner , is how you regard the situation and the discussions held by the council on this subject .
mr president , there is of course one matter we keep coming back to .
what are we in europe doing ?
why ?
thank you commissioner .
are there any comments ?
( parliament approved the minutes of the previous sitting . )
that is right and proper .
mr president , the commission has made a proposal , and parliament has no amendments to put forward .
support for such developments should be included in the provisions .
mr president , the end of the treaty means that something must be put in place .
we do not therefore consider this amendment to be necessary .
however i think that this is what can and should be put forward at this time .
the debate is closed .
i hope the house will feel able to support this report .
good things take time , though , and there will no doubt be another opportunity for the environment committee to have its say on transport issues .
the strategy of the two large parties in this parliament does not allow for this .
the second problem is that of funding .
this is also unacceptable , in my view .
even now , the commission paper is not free of these things .
this seems to be a waste of effort and resources to us .
indeed , most member states have been left out .
we cannot therefore accept amendment no 10 .
it would be different if we were always talking about projects of national interest .
it is true that some countries may have more interest in a specific project .
the debate is closed .
we must and should encourage both .
this would help the public to know and to understand what information they should expect .
we hope that will be taken up .
social responsibility is what it is about .
this must be done at the right time and in the right place .
we live in a different world .
this we must change .
the crucial thing is transparency .
what does this mean ?
i should like now to comment on a number of very specific points made in the parliamentary report .
the debate is closed .
madam president , i would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i have asked to speak as i wanted to draw the commission 's attention to a problem of legal basis in this report .
if that was outside the legal basis , then this part must be so too .
you have the floor to speak on a point of order .
your request will therefore be taken into account .
thank you , commissioner .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
absolutely !
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
mr president , just before you vote on this , i must bring it to parliament 's attention .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
i ask you to take note of this .
very well .
that , at any rate , is what is in the voting list .
i hope , therefore , that we can all support it .
i have voted against this paragraph .
therefore i have voted against .
why did i vote for it ?
this is left to the member states .
i very much welcome this and voted in favour of her report .
here 's to environmental information !
how could i vote against the directive ?
i voted for the motion , madam president .
1 .
2 .
the money will simply not be there any more .
what do we find ?
this clearly has not happened .
we now move to the order of business .
this is what we are about to vote on .
i feel that we have to take this extremely seriously .
i decided that of course i should come .
i would also say the same thing if we were in brussels .
( applause )
there are two points here .
i take your point on the different systems working . nevertheless , this is such a serious issue .
we now come to the other proposals for changes to the agenda .
when did the commission find out about this ?
what measures has it taken and what is the position of the commission at the moment ?
what has this office achieved over the past few years ?
could we take it as an addition ?
would that meet with the agreement of the house ?
( the house accepted this proposal )
( parliament agreed to the proposal )
the order of business is thus established
mr president , this is not a point of order ; i would just like to draw attention to something .
if we can agree to do that , we would have found at least the next necessary step .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , thank you , but i am not the first to do so .
there are , however , a few that are and i will focus my comments on just a few of those .
that is the item that members single out as being in need of reform , but it is very difficult to agree on reforms meeting with the necessary support .
if it does work we can continue .
those will be put to the house .
it is appropriate that the groups look at this .
i will stop now to allow myself some time to reply to the debate at the end .
it did not happen .
i hope that we in this house will support this very important proposal and work better on human rights .
if we want to change that , we have to vote on this report and vote for change .
we , together with the council , make up the budgetary authority .
i really do think it important that this amendment should not be adopted in the form proposed .
let me make a general comment before i deal with three points raised by the committee on legal affairs .
perhaps we will have to go a little further in the future .
there were , and are , three points of importance to the committee on legal affairs . the first is legislative initiatives .
a large number in my group will give it their support .
we need changes to our rules of procedure in order to achieve better balance in this respect .
a real parliament , in other words .
why is this so ?
it goes without saying that amendments express the groups ' political will .
that had not been done the last time , for some reason or other .
i hope that something can now be done about this in cooperation with the services .
the position of the group of the european people 's party has been extremely clear from the start .
we can , however , do more to reform the work of parliament .
perhaps we can return to that subject at a later stage .
the results of the convention in these areas will obviously need to be included in a new set of rules .
they do not .
well done !
why not ?
it cannot be that .
is that what you want ?
( applause )
in the past , this too was at least a matter of doubt .
the same applies to other urgent matters .
as regards the budget point , we had different views .
we do not need to come back to that issue ; we need to ensure that what we decided as a parliament is now applied .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
all that , in my opinion , is to the good .
but we are still open to dialogue with the rapporteur on this because we know what an excellent job he has done .
we have discussed every aspect of this issue during the debate , so i shall simply make two or three comments .
in this area , however , there is unfortunately still a great deal to be done .
i would like to make two final comments .
but the rapporteur is not without good reason .
thank you very much .
the joint debate is closed .
however , it is not enough .
this applies all the more to women .
no , that is not the case .
this is all possible .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this .
i also hope that this will be the case tomorrow when we vote on the report .
there is no question that employment is the best way to ensure integration .
and of course - and i will end here , mr president - joint action .
two important political points were also raised during the debate .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
a final regulation must result from discussions over the next few years .
i want to say something about the individual points .
i hope the house will support them .
there is no reference to that in the commission 's proposal .
this is not the case .
unfortunately this is not it .
our group has tabled two amendments .
i would also ask what the commission 's view is of this proposal .
this proposal is one of many .
we need competition , and i hope that my british colleagues will agree with me on that .
that is the objective .
let us hope that the council can adopt a decision at the next meeting , although i think that will be difficult , given the development of the technical work .
i hope that you will support this commission proposal in the vote tomorrow .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
an international solution would be much more positive .
thank you very much .
thank you very much , mr president .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
vote on request for urgent procedure
but that which is not , may yet be !
your comments will be taken into account in the vote on the content .
( parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
the next item is the joint debate on :
that is the fundamental idea behind the report .
this conflict was not on the union 's agenda .
we talk about it , but we almost always talk about it from the point of view of human rights .
there are two additional points i would like to make on the report .
the debate is closed .
that is the way we want it .
what do we want to achieve here today ?
what , then , do the people of europe want ?
what do we want in addition to that ?
not in the least do we want to ban them .
all groups in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy were very much of one mind on these various proposals .
mr president , i support the rapporteur 's position .
this is unacceptable .
the consumer has a right to know this .
this issue has been discussed for a long time , indeed for too long .
that is in itself something positive .
the possibility has been mentioned of a conflict with the wto .
that is a right one should of course be prepared to fight for .
we want to force them to take positive action .
commissioner , i really would like to encourage you to go down this road .
if we really want this , we simply have to say : as soon as possible .
human health must not be put at risk by what we are doing .
it is time to bring this issue to a conclusion .
that would be a better approach , both right in principle and right in practice .
what do you actually think will happen to european industry now ?
what do you take us for ?
i therefore feel that there are three matters to which parliament must draw the attention of both the commission and the council .
i must point out that the first priority is human health and then , of course , respect and protection for animals .
i would like to express my strong support for the report .
they would be of clear benefit to consumers .
however , this proposal has so far found very little support among the wto members .
that is the opinion of my colleagues who are responsible for this field in wto relations .
the debate is closed .
in conclusion , i hope that this directive will , at last , see the light of day and be adopted .
this is a very welcome report and i congratulate our rapporteur .
that is not the key issue .
the common position is a good basis for this .
mr president , commissioner , this is the second reading of a very important directive , a directive which concerns our strategy on public health and the safety of european citizens .
i should like , if i may , to comment on a number of them .
this directive will go a long way and is extremely important because of that .
i am not alone in saying that .
all other amendments are acceptable to the commission , either in full or in part .
amendment no 10 would cause major problems .
the debate is closed .
there must be a political response to this in the form of new rules to improve consumer safety .
that was a task for us here in parliament .
this alone makes amendment of the directive and other measures necessary .
that is why we should carry on along this road .
i cannot , therefore , accept these amendments .
these amendments are therefore not acceptable .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i request that a vote now be taken on the legislative proposal as well , as it would make no sense to return it to the committee .
i will follow the due procedure .
in this case , i would be in favour of the amendment and it would therefore be a good compromise agreement .
how many more new products do we need ?
we know that that is not the solution .
the solution is regulation by the law .
i hope that we will put such legislation into effect as soon as possible .
our contribution to it has now been made .
we consider the implementation of the directive to be important .
now we need to bring it to life .
either way it has been a long process .
that is what is being done .
madam president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work .
this is one of the only areas under the treaty where it is the parliament and not the commission which has the right of initiative .
this is certainly a success for democracy in europe .
this has not been achieved .
what has been put before us is a first step , and a good one .
what is to be done under such circumstances ?
why ?
you have my full support .
i believe this is a very important step forward .
thank you very much , madam president .
the debate is closed .
the commission has done an excellent job and done as much as it could .
now , more than ever , do we need political direction .
we know that they are a part of sustainable development .
there is a need for a fundamental change of course .
madam president , i had a speech prepared , but that is not the speech i shall give .
what are the real problems ?
and even greater efforts can be made , especially with regard to public assistance .
that applies to agricultural , trade and fisheries policies .
mr president , many things have been said .
the second priority is the right to water .
market access is a key issue .
finally , compromise with the us is one thing .
there is also a great deal which has been achieved and on which we have reached decisions .
we need to take more practical measures in precisely those areas mentioned here in the debate .
i want to thank you again for this important debate .
the debate is closed .
we have in practice achieved all our objectives and i might also say that the level of cooperation among the political groups has been quite excellent .
thank you .
there are a number of countries which really had not adopted a position on this issue before .
that is why i consider this to be so important .
the council has called on the commission to follow up the green paper as a matter of priority .
let me try and set out what a framework directive would do .
it would set the standards that business will have to meet when dealing with consumers .
however , i should add that i do not see this as a particular problem .
i thank the commissioner for his statement .
why is that ?
they have been the subject of discussion in the past .
that is my position .
i have three questions to put to you .
i wish to put three questions :
we welcome the proposals in the green paper .
however , i have two specific questions .
this is my first question .
mr president , that remains the case .
this has not been achieved .
a number of members raised that point .
my services and i support that .
that is not a response that we at european union level can accept .
this is a problem .
the subject will not go away .
the debate is closed .
part i
the objective of this reform was clearly to open the sector up further to competition .
do this and see what answer you are given .
the reality is that the single market is not working .
at the moment this is all i can say .
so , there were a number of reports where we asked for that as well .
i believe that we are doing that in this case .
i fully agree with that .
they have come to the conclusion that i have presented to you .
as you point out , mr president , the question raised by the honourable member is not the question that has been tabled .
i will answer them all , but it will unfortunately take a few minutes .
i will take questions 2 and 3 together .
there is no doubt about that .
thank you very much for your cooperation , commissioner .
i do not understand this .
this is how things stand .
this has been a major request by the european parliament .
i should like to thank the commissioner for his response to the question .
i am sure that we can come back to this issue later .
we need to pay particular attention to that .
that is something on which we completely agree .
parliament has a crucial role to play in this process of cultural change .
that is not for the commission to decide .
secondly ; does he feel that there is a need for some independent assessment ?
that is a commitment for the whole commission .
the commission has no final view on that matter .
i am sure that you will also discuss it in your context .
we take good note of your comments .
that is very important .
i thank the commissioner .
that only applies , however , if this right is established in the member states ' legislation .
to do it , they will also need support .
the debate is closed .
this is what it is all about .
you should see this programme in that light too .
a number of amendments proposed by our committee refer to nuclear waste and nuclear safety .
mr president , i shall refer to five reports - and two minutes times five makes ten !
we really need to change this .
this is unacceptable .
in fact they are by their very nature essential .
thanks go to everyone who has been involved .
on the other hand we have very good experience of cooperation between authorities .
perhaps .
as regards sustainable development , research needs to be used to deal with environmental problems .
parliament wanted to go further than the common position had done .
in any case , the framework programme is only a basis .
i now turn to the individual reports .
all of this is work that we can do together .
we will have to consider how to implement it and we can do so together .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i must stress once again that all this does not just apply to the commission .
i thank the president of the commission .
( applause )
nothing new is being said .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , president of the commission , first of all , i should share a saying with you .
the ministers for justice and home affairs have still not taken an effective decision on this matter .
we must set up a true common asylum and immigration policy .
they are sometimes right .
the european union is currently dealing with difficult areas such as agricultural affairs , regional policy and budgetary matters .
this is the crucial thing !
we all agree on the need for a balance between these two requirements , but i feel that a sufficient balance has not yet been found .
the final issue is that of immigration .
this applies not in the least to the council .
what can be done about this ?
a commission proposal is being considered in parliament , and it is not on the council agenda .
this is not on the council agenda .
we do not understand that here , and nor does the public .
are you going to debate this ?
why would this be the first thing on the council agenda ?
that is not all , however .
we have to support these .
let us now turn our attention to the people .
mr president , i should like to thank the council for its statement and thank the president of the commission for his contribution .
my second point is the issue of immigration .
this has now been created .
i do not know why the issue is being raised again now .
as well as all these issues , there are other external policy issues which we have already discussed .
is that the responsibility of the council ?
i believe , therefore , that this is a successful result , and i should like to thank all those who took part in this work .
i want to get on with the vote .
we are here to vote .
a large number of people wish to speak .
.
does the rapporteur agree ?
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the decision )
i congratulate you once again .
among the many reasons for that support , there are three which are particularly crucial and essential as far as i am concerned .
that is why i shall be voting against this report .
four days , which means three days of work - is that serious , is it effective ?
the same thing must also apply , of course , to parliament as a place of work .
you are extremely welcome here .
not much is said about this , but it is a very important issue .
our position will be very clear on this .
we cannot act in any other way .
let there be no doubt that this is extremely important .
i would finally like to thank the commission for the support they have given us at all times , right from the beginning of our presidency .
you can say it , but it does not change anything .
)
i expect that the european council in brussels will then take its decision on that basis .
both countries still need more time to meet the accession criteria .
i think i can also say that never before has a future member state been better prepared for its new role .
we are making very high demands .
commission , parliament , council , we can all do a great deal .
the same applies to enlargement and european integration as a whole . we also have to stand up for this europe outside the institutions .
( applause )
this also applies in many other areas which the commissioner mentioned , such as institutional issues .
we cannot make additional demands .
this is a key issue .
this has actually brought us to this debate here today .
without that effort , we simply would not be in this situation now .
so now is not the time to stop .
both the commission and the parliament are doing their work .
i hope that this will be achieved in good time .
how long will it take before they are able to do so ?
this is accepted as a matter of course in our own countries .
it has made excellent progress on a great many issues .
a europe in which we feel at home .
they are not new and concern in many cases other candidate countries too .
for a number of these points , demands are high .
we must take new initiatives .
in my view , this is unacceptable .
finally , i should like to mention one very important point .
until then , we must help them .
what can we say ?
we call upon the council and especially some member states to give their support to the course adopted by the commission on agriculture .
we feel that this is a very important point .
of course , there are reasons for this .
we hope that there will be a major step forward this year .
we cannot accept it .
let us try and make the best of it !
the president-in-office of the council is right in saying that enlargement is one thing and agricultural policy another .
naturally i hope that the amendments tabled by my committee on the subject will be adopted tomorrow .
how can we achieve this following enlargement ?
this is our question .
this is how we as parliament would have wanted it , and this is how it has been all these years .
let us hope that they put up and do so in the best possible way .
that was difficult enough in itself .
the first point is the high level of unemployment in a number of the candidate countries .
however , we should be able to deal with these .
the commission will have to try to answer this question during the current debate on the common fisheries policy .
we want it to be .
we hope it will be .
i believe the european parliament has accepted its responsibility .
eu enlargement can be achieved only by the eu , the member states and their regions working together .
but the eu budget is not under such pressure .
madam president , i shall deal with two main points in this question of enlargement .
it is coming , that is a fact , and it is good that it is .
the public needs to know what to expect .
they have a right to know .
the same is true of employment in the economy as a whole .
let us look at individual countries .
i wish to draw attention to one matter .
however , without enlargement , the reform of agricultural policy will not take place .
madam president , three points .
he might have been able to tell us more .
that would not be so great .
madam president , enlargement is work on behalf of peace , stability and civil rights .
we have seen that before .
would that be all right ?
at any rate , that remains our objective .
as we see it , there is certainly still a lot to be done .
finally , we will not move forward without compromise .
mr president , the enlargement of the union is a political project .
mr president , i should first like to thank both the presidency and the commission .
after today 's debate , it could be parliament 's agenda .
clearly , we also need to make the public understand the reasons behind some of our decisions .
in that connection we must say that this enlargement will demand something of everyone .
we very much welcome what the commission has proposed .
at this point we can guarantee full support .
after that , it will be necessary to think again .
for the time after that there will have to be proper negotiations .
they may work on one side and live on the other .
let us ensure that everyone can have their request for asylum considered .
enlargement is the eu 's absolutely most important priority .
it does not .
this applies to both objectives 1 , 2 and 3 and to the new initiatives .
this should happen now .
i want to deal with the agricultural side because i want to see a proper reform of the common agricultural policy before enlargement takes place .
i am also very concerned to avoid food coming into the european union that does not meet the high standards of our production .
we have to be very clear on this .
the first accession process is only the first stage .
so we too have to talk about their problems .
secondly , the funds that continue to be needed for the development of rural areas must be provided by all the structural policy measures and not just from the common agricultural policy .
thank you , president-in-office of the council .
my last point is that a very large number of you have mentioned the agricultural reforms .
mr president , various comments have been made on the structural funds .
one cannot put a price on values such as these .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( applause )
this is what i have to say to you .
that is something of which you should take account .
make of that what you will .
mr president , the committee on fisheries has voted in favour of the commission proposal that we are now discussing , as we have done for previous resolutions adopted by this house .
mr president , thank you for giving me the floor on this important matter .
this decision is to be applied for a period of ten years .
of course , he is right and the commission would like to express its agreement with that statement .
you may speak on a point of order , but that is what you already have done .
the debate is closed .
he has asked me to present the report on his behalf and on behalf of the committee .
what are this programme 's objectives ?
what is crucial is that we include the committee on economic and monetary affairs ' amendments in the commission 's programme , for that is the way we have taken , and it is the right one .
that is important , especially in the area of tax .
i and the commission are therefore extremely pleased that this proposal is supported by the european parliament .
it will do its best to reach an agreement as soon as possible .
i should like to thank parliament for that support .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is one of the objectives in this proposal for a directive .
we shall therefore vote against this amendment .
a number of amendments have already been discussed .
the commission cannot accept it .
the commission cannot accept that amendment .
the debate is closed .
i call on the commissioner to think it over for once .
if not , i hope the council can bring it back in .
since this is the first time , it is very important that we get it right .
however , what did the committee on fisheries do ?
we must vote against this amendment .
i agree with the rapporteur on this point .
it is completely unacceptable .
we cannot continue as we have done in the past .
it is crucial that the commission does this .
who would seriously call their data into question ?
now !
we have to be sure that these measures are put in place .
let me now comment on the amendments .
for those reasons the commission cannot accept that amendment .
this amendment is therefore not necessary .
regarding amendment no 10 , the commission cannot accept that amendment .
the commission cannot accept amendment no 11 .
the commission cannot accept amendment no 12 .
the commission cannot accept amendment no 15 .
it will take some time for the proposed measures to take effect .
the debate is closed .
the council and parliament are now in agreement , and i think the commission should take this into account .
on the positive side , the specific measures proposed by the commission are welcome .
most of the amendments proposed can be accepted by the commission .
a solution should be found within the context of that article .
amendment no 20 , however , is more difficult to accept .
the debate is closed .
these are the demands made by the committee .
i therefore think it right to call for a framework directive in this case in particular .
i support the rapporteur 's motion .
thank you , mr president .
i therefore think it important to apply past efforts as a basis for a framework directive .
this effort is therefore a welcome one .
mr president , commissioner , i would first like to thank the rapporteur for the work that she has done , despite all the pressure that we have all been under .
making the first move is always better than doing nothing .
everyone has his or her own responsibility to take .
as far as the specific content of this resolution is concerned , there is only one conclusion possible , in my view .
thank you , mr president .
however , this has already taken some time .
this is what we should focus our attention on now .
i would like , commissioner , to make another point .
we are taking only a first step .
the issue is a lot more serious than that .
what will we have to offer in terms of technology in two , three or four years ' time ?
now it is the turn of the european parliament to express its views .
it has been asked what the commission will do if the report is accepted .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i hope that this house will support this approach .
i should like to make three points .
so we need to be aware of the impact of our legislation on business and jobs .
mr president , i would just like to address this question of better regulation .
i believe that we should do this at second reading , once we have received the common position from the council and we know what parliament 's amendments were at first reading .
indeed , so should the council .
it was not , however .
there is still much to be done to establish the internal market in services .
we shall return to this in the green paper .
these are all political measures .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the european parliament can , therefore , give its full support to this process .
in my opinion , there is certainly no reason to draft legislation at european level at this stage .
i hope that this report can make a contribution to this .
it is a question of education , training and best practice .
that is absolutely important .
information must be available to all .
the commission 's aim to bring the information society within everyone 's reach is democracy .
i believe that this is the priority as far as content is concerned .
the number of old people is increasing .
if you did , did you feel the way i did ?
the most important information is not there .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it is not acceptable .
we should not be asked to work under these conditions .
it is high time something was done .
it also takes account of the most important amendments at first reading .
it cannot therefore be accepted .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
there is something wrong with it .
mr president , we must be clear about what we are voting on .
so we should not be having a vote on it at all .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote :
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote :
the result is now clear for all to see .
the first part of the solution is to change those priorities , but we are still a long way from doing that today .
we did not take part in the vote on this resolution .
what do we have to offer ?
we simply have to include this ; i cannot express it in any other way .
we cannot continue like this .
we have therefore , quite obviously , voted against this report .
we must prevent them .
why ?
because these children are the economic future of the developing countries .
i only hope that today 's debate and the resolution which follow it will be effective this time .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
but i am left with questions .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
mr president , i will start with an individual case .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
why ?
the way forward is clear : the government must ensure respect for human rights and internal law .
the debate is closed .
the other point has to do with paragraph 5 .
i have voted against the report .
we do not , however , believe that resources additional to those in the commission proposal need to be provided .
we now move to the order of business .
i do not want to open up a debate on this , as that would be against the rules .
it is not acceptable to this house and it should not be acceptable to the european union .
thank you for your attention .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i should like to take the place of the rapporteur in this matter .
a european information system , for example , is of major importance to the european transport sector .
we voted in favour of it in the committee .
i think that we have finally achieved - after many years of work and thanks to a proposal by the commission , which is already a compromise - a good balance .
mr president , i would like first like to congratulate the rapporteur on taking the commission proposal , which was a good one , and making it even better .
there is also much to be said for doing so without coming up with a specific rule on the subject .
what results we achieve are a matter for democracy and for tomorrow 's vote .
in any case , the rapporteur has done a good job .
a less appropriate idea is to include social provisions in this text .
this is not the place for these .
that too is indeed part of the regulation .
it is a good compromise , and one that i support .
i am saying this against the interests of my country and those of its transport sector .
we are all working very hard on this .
there is a general need for european regulation .
that is the issue .
are you prepared to support it ?
so that is what we need .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i had presented an amendment in this regard .
this is not its aim .
a common internal market demands more than the development of instruments by some states and not by others .
thank you , madam president .
i believe it is , but the commission might be able to make some changes for the better .
we will support this at any rate .
why do we demand this ?
we have also , commissioner , tabled a number of amendments .
do we want that as well ?
the directive will be important for the sector 's industry and will point the way to developments in the years to come .
the question is how we can achieve these objectives .
it is true that we cannot expect too much of the directive .
all we have to do is give them that framework .
if they are not , then i cannot vote for a compromise at first reading stage .
let us do all we can to get the reports through ; i ask members to support them .
in this context , mr president , i am going to comment on the two proposals .
some of you have said that there are not so many of them .
with regard to this proposal , the commission can accept several of the amendments .
the joint debate is closed .
this report has already been adopted by parliament .
mr president , there is no democracy without transparency !
you are all aware of my position on nuclear energy .
this will deal with the whole area of nuclear safety and security .
if you have anything to add , commissioner , you may do so .
the debate is closed .
i think we will continue to work very well together .
after a good three years ' work by parliament and the commission , where do we stand ?
let me address just three of them .
this is an important step in the right direction .
the question remains , however .
how will we protect the cultural content ?
this is not enough , however .
we shall adopt in committee the report on the directive 's application between now and the end of the year .
the debate is closed .
a number of financial instruments were set up by the community and the european investment bank in order to achieve these objectives .
my comments ?
these include the candidate countries .
that will be the appropriate time to make any changes to the list of projects or the funding conditions .
i shall now turn to amendment no 10 .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following three reports :
let me start with the common foreign and security policy .
in our view , there are too few resources .
this will also be the case next year .
if it was up to my group , we would .
this means that more information about the implementation of the 2002 budget is needed , and this we will , of course , have as the budget year takes its course .
now , in view of the first reading , the council has prepared a resolution that the commission absolutely cannot support .
something is wrong here .
let me also address the issue of civil crisis management .
one point is that we do not yet have a common fisheries policy .
if and when we do have one , that will be a problem for next year .
i do not think that is possible but if we could get an agreement as to what we want to do throughout the year , then we can come to some conclusions .
the present system does not work .
we are all aware of the difficulties involved in the management of the budgetary procedure and the pressure on those who are responsible for it each year .
not that much , then , one might think .
the debate is closed .
i think that i can say that progress has been made in each and every one of these areas .
this objective would not have been possible without the support of parliament and particularly without the support of the commission .
another of the presidency 's priorities was to move forward in enlargement negotiations .
in order to achieve this , the council has created this new general affairs and external relations council .
this decision needs to be taken by the next intergovernmental conference .
it was important that the european union summit with russia was successful .
one of the objectives of this summit was to promote regional integration in the area .
that is also the idea behind our set of proposals on better regulation .
this is not a point of order .
( applause )
( applause )
that is the first thing .
( applause )
( applause )
finally , mr president-in-office of the council , there is the subject of democratic control and the reform of the council .
( applause )
we need more europe but also , and above all , a better europe .
that is at least a start .
all other countries in the world still wish to be more open than ourselves .
it is not one yet , however .
we want and need enlargement as our next great step forward .
how will these two institutions be involved in this work ?
very good .
europe is not doing well , mr president-in-office of the council , it is not doing better than it was six months ago .
( applause )
what a great idea !
much has been said about them .
he did not say it once , he said it five times !
it was right to do so .
what happened to that ?
the fight against terrorism was one of your priorities .
enlargement was one of your priorities .
it is precisely in difficult times like these that europe must keep on course .
progress has been made in european security policy .
i also have a concern to express and a request to make .
that is our objective , to achieve full employment .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
the first point concerned further debate on the issue of terrorism .
i still feel , however , that this is the only course open to us for the future .
they are a practical way for us to start to work together .
( applause )
the next item is the vote .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before the vote :
we believe that the common position is better .
that is why i voted for the motion .
that is why i voted for the motion .
yet , this control is very much needed under the present circumstances .
why is that ?
for these reasons , we could not vote for this report .
( applause from the right )
that is the way it should be !
i do think it important that there should be even greater transparency in the european monetary union .
( applause from the left )
i shall only refer to two points from today 's debate , which are of particular interest to the commission .
mr president , thank you for giving me the floor .
thank you again .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on two reports , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy :
on that basis consumers can avoid products they do not wish to use .
the second priority must be a health guarantee .
here in parliament , we talk a great deal about freedom , transparency and solidarity .
we know that .
that goes without saying .
should we , however , follow the commission 's system ?
we know that on this issue there is strong pressure from industry and from certain national governments to vote against the line taken by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
mr president , i welcome the commission proposal .
we have to continue to ask questions .
is this really giving the public what they want ?
i do not believe this proposal does that .
we have to think again .
why ?
many people are concerned .
we have reason to take these concerns seriously .
i therefore fully support the proposal of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
it is therefore unacceptable .
i therefore hope that tomorrow 's vote will achieve this .
a second point concerns the position of third countries .
i consider this unacceptable .
if we therefore want to give consumers clear information on what they want to know , it is indeed possible .
mr president , first of all i must ask why we have two reports at all .
they are particularly concerned .
this debate will continue .
allow me to mention three main points .
who is it for , what is its purpose and what is it going to do ?
commissioner , i very much welcome your comments .
i would like to ask the commissioner three questions :
mr president , i thank all the members of parliament for their great interest in and support for this proposal .
the commission did its best to take into account the comments from your side .
mr president , i wish to answer two questions .
how often will it meet ?
where will it meet ?
how much will it cost ?
who is going to pay for it ?
no , i cannot be more specific at this time .
the debate is closed .
part i
thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
citizens must be aware of their rights .
the commission needs to take special measures and review the situation .
from the commissioner 's reply , i understand that you share the view that such a review is necessary .
that is no longer possible .
i thank the commissioner for his response .
you will certainly understand that this is , in a certain way , a matter of interest to members .
part i
the question is ; what is the impact of the american measures on employment ?
this has happened before and it will certainly happen again .
that is our position .
i should like to thank the commissioner for his answer .
we have no legal authority to do so .
if so , how much money ?
that is my question .
i can see that this may be a problem , because it will obviously have social consequences on the farmers in question .
priority is given to human and animal health .
but consumers do not know that and perhaps they should not know that .
i have every confidence in you .
we are all agreed on that and we would do so at once .
therefore , the commission cannot support amendments of this nature .
as such , the commission cannot accept these amendments .
the first is the scope of the proposal .
.
but let us look at this again at second reading .
that is why we have come forward with this particular proposal .
that has been the objective from the beginning .
that is what parliament has already voted for .
i have said it before and i will say it again . whether we like it or not , this has become a reality .
we have to live in the real world .
a full list of the commission 's position on each of the amendments is being provided to parliament .
the joint debate is closed .
public health protection is currently one of the main concerns of the citizens of the union .
however , i should like to comment on the budget for the programme .
the first one concerns the budget .
the debate is closed .
on behalf of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , i should like to call for four amendments .
safety is not only a question of rules but indeed also of culture .
it is now high time that this legislation was applied .
the european union would then be in line with the public and its safety demands .
i proposed that we should move forward with this amendment .
so we have taken a very positive approach .
there are other amendments that the commission cannot accept .
thank you for the debate .
the debate is closed .
ladies and gentlemen , i have very good reasons for giving this speech .
moreover , there is reason for concern .
that is the job of the member states .
she is right to call for effective measures .
human rights or women 's rights - they are still rights .
that has nothing to do with rights .
however , women will go where they can .
we will be voting in favour of the proposal tomorrow .
therefore , mr president , my group will vote against this report .
why ?
we should not , therefore , even be discussing it or voting on it tomorrow .
and it is our right to do so , provided that this is allowed by law and that this is what our citizens want .
unfortunately that has not happened , and that is why i shall be voting against this report .
i do not mind what your views are on this issue .
quite a lot of other matters have been raised .
european integration must give priority to these values .
thank you , mr president .
allow me to give you a fundamental reason .
the fact remains , however , that this debate is out of time .
that is the first reason why i shall not be voting in favour of this report .
why is that ?
what , then , is the framework for good practice ?
does it make any sense in the context of the european union ?
this is about them but without them .
i am pleased that at least these amendments , tabled by our group , have been adopted .
mr president , i would like to make a point of order .
this is clear from the treaty .
at present we do not have the power to do so .
let me be clear .
this is the responsibility of member states .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
so what was important for us ?
working together means solidarity between the member states in the group .
that is out of the question .
why ?
i congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report , to which i give my full support .
mr president , to follow on from what you just said , a very good morning .
my thanks also to the rapporteur .
the thing now is to hand out the money as quickly as possible and i wish you every success in doing so , commissioner .
thank you again to all concerned .
the commission cannot accept this , but we shall try to find a compromise .
thank you commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
i do not actually believe that this is appropriate in the european parliament .
we face important decisions in connection with our common decision making .
i welcome these decisions .
( applause )
we want to focus on four areas in particular :
firstly , we want to work towards greater freedom , security and justice .
( applause )
finally , the presidency will give priority to the work on a new common fisheries policy for the member states .
i will apply three principles in the negotiations concerning enlargement of the eu :
( applause )
( applause )
firstly , there is the question of funding .
this applies in particular to the negotiations concerning agriculture , structural funds and budgets .
in my opinion the commission has found the right balance in its proposal .
( applause )
we cannot do it alone ; we need all our partners .
thank you , mr president .
all these issues are currently being discussed in the debate on the future of europe within the european convention .
other people talk about it but we are trying to make it reality .
( applause )
( applause )
then we will debate them .
i should like to make a few comments on turkey .
we hope that we will also see results at the political level by the end of 2002 .
mr president-in-office , i should like to thank you for what you have said .
( applause )
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen .
in this respect , i must say that i believe this is a good political approach .
that is why you are having problems with the council .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
you are to us a model of democracy , transparency and of international solidarity - so far , at least - and i hope that this will continue to be the case .
should they all become member states before they are taken seriously ?
europe is not yet ' one ' .
it is crucial that we support sustainable development with more people in work and a better economy .
i think that you will receive a great deal of support from parliament .
enlargement will give europe 's new citizens rights .
our new citizens must have this right from day one .
the past should not stand in the way of the present .
but perhaps he will have a little more to say to us about this .
what is really going on here ?
of course this is allowed .
the rule of law and democracy are on the way out .
on the subject of that priority , let me ask you three questions .
your priority is enlargement .
are you absolutely sure of that , mr president-in-office ?
a good political decision - well done !
in this respect we still have a great deal to do .
my question concerns the recent american initiative .
sometimes we are wrong , and other times we are right .
i must say that i am concerned about developments .
i also believe that it is important for us to meet these demands ourselves .
why do i say that ?
( applause )
turkey does not do so at the current point in time .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
we support you on your three issues .
we will work with you on that .
now is the time for action not words , as you said .
thank you .
( applause )
this is an important subject for the member states as well as the candidate countries .
i cannot agree , on the other hand , with what has been said about the commission 's proposals regarding the agricultural budget and agricultural aid .
what initiatives do you think the union should take ?
but what europe , president-in-office ?
. that is not so .
( applause )
this can only be a reference to his private life .
nevertheless , we cannot have immigration at any price .
( applause )
i hope and believe that you will bring this about .
we now come to the vote .
firstly , it is based on a part of the treaty dealing with environmental protection .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , i voted against this proposal for a regulation .
that is why i voted against the report .
i am in favour of the 1 % rule .
that is why i voted for it .
she has made every possible effort so that the three institutions might find a compromise that could be adopted at first reading .
i am sure we all agree that this is a concern .
i wish this were discussed more in this parliament .
human life cannot be subject to voting .
we also point out that :
i have voted against this report .
measures to encourage production are essential , but are not alone the solution to the problems .
time will tell what the impact of this decision will be .
i would , therefore , not want the commission to encourage this .
think nothing , see nothing , do nothing .
however , a few changes will have to be made in that case .
in principle , there is food for everyone .
although most people live in rural areas , too little attention is given to food production .
i am aware that there will be a debate later on fisheries and hope to say something at that point .
)
things could be different .
this is still the reality .
we hope to move forward on this .
i agree .
it is coming .
some things do work .
thank you , commissioner .
the eu and the united states share the same basic values of freedom , democracy , human rights and the principles of a state based on the rule of law .
we have no doubt that the united states could make a particularly positive contribution to the court .
that is a policy we wish to continue .
the creation of an international criminal court is central to this fight .
thank you , commissioner .
we did this because we share the same values and standards .
"
perhaps this is an opportunity for europe .
however , until they do , europe must take the lead .
the united states does not want partners .
there are other problems .
the commissioner has called for a dialogue with our us colleagues .
i should like to address the president of this parliament .
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to ask the commissioner and the president-in-office , and indeed all of us , why this is the case .
what is the problem , then ?
we view the matter very seriously .
thank you , commissioner .
parliament 's report is a compromise report .
i will end my speech here , mr president , and i hope the house can adopt the draft report tomorrow .
this has not , unfortunately , been common practice .
however , they , and we , need action from the commission , either by a resolution or by a directive .
it is , therefore , essential that we aim to provide a high level of protection for consumers in this field .
however , i am well aware that a number of consumer protection problems still exist .
therefore , more needs to be done .
the debate is closed .
i thank the president-in-office of the council or , perhaps i should say , the honourable member .
thank you very much .
i have nothing further to add .
for better i hope of course .
i am pleased that we are agreed on this .
we can then hope that a solution will be found as soon as possible .
mr president , i can provide the following information about the council position .
conflict resolution must therefore be our first priority .
we look forward to progress in this area .
we believe we are doing what we can .
will the council now make a statement on the current situation regarding this decision and whether other developed countries are following the eu 's lead ?
i cannot , however , say any more at the present time .
to put the question again ?
very good .
welcome , president-in-office .
mr president , i was very much aware of the fact that there was a question .
as they deal with the same subject , questions nos 11 and 12 will be taken together .
thank you for your answer to my question .
secondly , we must provide training for young people at local level .
i shall make a point of reading it .
in my country , the government has opportunities to develop legal provisions further .
we have now reached agreement in the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
the rapporteur has said that these measures will guarantee the safety of products .
allow me to add that they will also guarantee the safety of workers , in particular , and that of citizens , in general .
we need to make sure that they are allowed to continue .
some work still needs to be done ; there are still some aspects to be considered .
he has done a long and hard job on this .
they are still being discussed in the council .
we do not want to let them down .
one of these has already been mentioned .
the debate is closed .
colleagues will be aware that there is also a great deal of concern in europe at the moment about asylum and immigration .
we must ensure that any new legislation does not stand in the way of these important european fundamental rights .
thank you for your attention , and thank you , commissioner , for having brought this very important legal and indeed political issue before parliament .
this is not the case today .
this is unacceptable .
this is the example to follow .
unfortunately , the proposed framework decision does not go far enough in this direction .
yet this is the very thing it does not do .
what does the report do ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
account should be taken of the fact that in several member states , the decision is taken by a political authority , such as in my country , for example , where the government takes this decision .
the committee on economic and monetary affairs has included in its report some of the conclusions of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
mr president , the european commission 's proposal on the reform is welcome .
once again , this is particularly important for small countries .
i would like to mention a few particular points .
this is not currently the case .
we need more competition .
we want competition on the basis of common rules .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i wish to express my thanks for this excellent report .
i want to be very clear on this point .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
what does the commission mean by real interest ?
we agree with her and thank her for her work .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
this , mr president , is a crucial point .
in my opinion the two reports we are discussing now show clearly the need for action .
"
i will now continue in my own words .
that was how it put it .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the two reports which are the subject of this debate both deal with the implementation of the common fisheries policy .
the debate is closed .
each country must be able to decide on the basis of its own values and its own approach .
this is one of the reasons why i have voted against .
but above all i have voted against the report because i do not agree in any way with its proposals .
we need to go further , however .
that is something we have asked for many times and which is crucial if the work is to be based on real data and if it is to be more effective .
the work programme ' equal opportunities ' for the year 2002 is an excellent document .
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
i have been asked if i agree with it .
a third issue raised was the application of legislation in the member states .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
in conclusion , i would like to thank the other political groups for their excellent cooperation in the committee with regard to this important area .
we would therefore like the text adopted in committee to remain in its current form .
i should like to make two comments on this human measure in the employment strategy .
finally , i should like to express my support for this resolution .
mr president , i want to address two points here .
there were , unfortunately , no additional financial resources ; these had to come out of the european social fund .
dialogue is taking place between the social partners .
this is already the case in certain sectors .
we must achieve such a balance in the future .
the debate is closed .
i would like to mention three points which , in my view , are fundamental .
this is an important point .
it is not work .
and i wanted us to state this even more clearly .
this is , in my view , how we must understand it .
on behalf of the committee on development , i want to stress four points in particular .
it is positive that this is being done .
on behalf of my group , i can therefore say that we are completely behind this report .
unfortunately , not all countries share our view of workers ' rights .
we must therefore put the pressure on .
i should like to ask the commissioner two questions in this respect .
my first question is about europe itself .
between , for example , the commissioner for development and humanitarian aid and the commissioner for employment and social affairs .
to what extent are you involved in these issues ?
i congratulate the rapporteur on her work in making this possible .
i should like to comment on a few specific points raised by the honourable members .
the role of the international labour organisation .
i am concerned that this very much applies to agriculture .
i would like to stress the following fact .
we will be voting against both amendments .
i have raised it with the rapporteur and he is in agreement with this .
mr president , i did not want to speak until the vote on the second part had been taken .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
joint motion for a resolution

we shall pay close attention to developments in this area by the end of the year .
in the hope that this will happen , we voted for the motion .
1 .
2 .
3 .
4 .
i am sure others have too .
i welcome the fact that we are taking action on this .
no doubt , this will not come to anything either .
thank you , mr president .
what can the european union do in the current situation ?
this is something that i very much doubt .
i do not propose to go over them again .
this is something we must avoid .
thank you , mr president .
that is what they need now .
the debate is closed .
we should put pressure on them too .
thank you , mr president .
something has to be done about this , and the european union is in a position to do it .
that must not continue .
mr president , could i draw your attention and that of the services to paragraph 12 of the proposed resolution ?
the debate is closed .
that , however , is something he did not do .
this has nothing to do with reality .
he took a stand for freedom , democracy , health and public safety .
what do we ask ?
look at me . i am human .
thank you , mr president .
despite everything , it is a european state .
a new strategy is required .
the debate is closed .
we must help others to help themselves .
now there is a need for reforms .
the debate is closed .
the following change has been proposed :
mr president , i believe that the criminal court has the support of almost all the parliamentary groups .
mr president , i believe we are all in favour of the international criminal court .
in a common position , we have all - the member states and parliament - given our word .
that is what would be called for in that situation .
thank you very much .
i would be very pleased to do so on behalf of parliament .
( the agenda was adopted )
mr president , it is also with regard to the agenda .
i really do hope that you will do this .
there is no political deal , only a problem of terrorism .
these matters were raised in parliament 's resolution last year .
i should like to single out a few key points .
one effect is at any rate clear .
it is important for us to take the first step now .
i thank you for your attention and look forward to the debate .
how is that to be achieved ?
so it can be achieved , we can achieve a reduction if we put the policies in place to encourage this .
this is why the amendments tabled by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy are a good start .
the progress made is clear to see .
perhaps we should be working towards a framework directive on waste .
let us see if we can improve them .
my colleague has already mentioned this .
we have always made environmental policy with business rather than against it .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we have to look at the world as it is , not the way we think the world should be .
much more needs to be done .
i will just focus on two main issues here .
firstly , aid , particularly technical assistance , is a key issue .
the commissioner has mentioned the data relating to the european union , which are certainly the most important data given for development aid in the world .
that is my conclusion in general .
unfortunately , i come across these far too often in most countries .
my group has tabled a few amendments at second reading .
this is how it has always been .
mr president , first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur for his report .
so , those are a few proposals we should support .
that is what sustainable development is about .
only then can we really talk about sustainable development .
it is a matter of power relations .
i would like to draw the attention of the house to the global health fund that has been established .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the commission has shown a great deal of interest in this sector .
this does not make sense .
this is also a significant environmental issue .
this , however , is not the case at all .
quite simply , this is unacceptable .
why is that ?
the debate is closed .
( applause )
furthermore , we feel that a matter of crucial importance is cooperation between civil and military authorities .
in this sense , we feel that it is an essential point .
we have made a step forward .
there is , however , something i would like to add .
so i ask you to vote for these projects by a large majority .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , ' and yet it does move ' - european air transport policy , i mean .
that is a great step forward for europe .
things still need to be done in that area .
we cannot continue to accept this situation .
we feel that the majority of member states share the same view .
that is one way to do it .
there are , of course , a number of issues relating to community air transport which we need to look at .
that is against international rules .
we do not see them and , therefore , we are still concerned .
but we are not there yet .
that is the real agenda .
the same applies to the issue of cooperation between civil and military authorities .
now it is up to the council .
there is still much to be done .
an amendment has been tabled to this effect .
and that is not all .
what we are not going to do is change the treaty by means of a directive .
i therefore support the rapporteur and all the effort he has made in order to reach agreement with everyone .
since the commissioner is here , i would like to make a different comment , still in connection with this debate .
thus far , the directive makes sense .
why is this so ?
i ask the whole house to support these amendments .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is why i consider this proposal to be a very important initiative for the internal market 's future development .
i would like to stress a few points .
mr president , every freedom is based on a balance .
thank you very much .
that way , nothing can go wrong . '
we will have the services look into all of that .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament approved the request )
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
president .
colleagues , thank you for your cooperation .
i therefore share the rapporteur 's conclusions .
i hope that more will be done in future .
the impact on the developing countries is , although essential , not the only consideration .
the report is making a step in the wrong direction .
' .
i must now mention another : that of relations with the military .
we should pay more attention to public service and safety .
that is why we have voted against them .
all well and good .
allow me to give just one example .
as you can see , this proposal is , therefore , different .
it has a purpose .
( applause )
action to help candidate countries also has the support of our group .
thank you , mr president , even though there is not a very great deal to express thanks for .
three things are needed .
secondly , the legal circumstances need to be created .
i believe that that is the case .
there is , then , a need for additional money .
with that in mind , i hope parliament , and all of us , will be able to do the right thing .
european solidarity is called for , and the eu has come up with the right response .
however , the european union is also being called on to help .
but may i point out that , even if we single out the structural funds and give priority to certain measures , we cannot stop there .
this money needs to be provided in the short term .
additional funds cannot be provided in the short term .
for me and for my country , the european union means solidarity , both with the member states , and with the candidate countries .
i say that in the light of what we have done in the budget in previous years .
unfortunately , there was never enough money available to really be able to help .
and urgent help is needed .
but its job is not yet done .
thank you minister .
these areas can already be used in the regions in question .
we need to set this fund up first .
thank you for your support .
we do , however , have a responsibility .
that is the commitment i am giving .
thank you commissioner .
thank you , minister .
thank you for your attention .
my other political point concerns the common foreign and security policy .
the president-in-office mentioned it in his speech .
let us be clear on our position .
that is all i want to say on the political aspects .
new concerns for 2002 included the global health fund .
it is time to take this state of affairs seriously .
the debate is closed .
part i
i have no doubt about that .
we must help them deal with that problem .
the total cost of the project is eur 3 million .
however , it will be possible to look at the matter again at that time .
thank you very much , commissioner .
we are now going to start the second part of this question time .
part two
what might the commission be able to do ?
can the commissioner give me an answer on this point ?
could you perhaps comment on that ?
there is nothing wrong with that .
president .
we are not .
thank you .
thank you , mr president .
that is a good thing .
i thank the commissioner for his reply and the stand which he has taken on this matter .
i should like to put two questions to you .
i agree that i have said nothing new .
but that is because there is nothing new to report .
the most important instrument which we can give the united nations and which we have given them is the accession process .
that is my question .
but that does not just apply to future member states ; it also applies to the majority of current member states .
i also believe that this is a question of practical importance .
there must be a practical solution .
mr president , on a point of order .
i know that he asked to put a question .
how democratic is that ?
i should like to make a few comments on the european employment strategy in particular .
mr president , i would like to thank the commission for today 's communication .
i do , however , remain concerned about two points .
my second concern is that the first and last mention of parliament is in may , in relation to the employment guidelines .
mr president , thank you for that information we have received from the commission .
these are the essential issues i wanted to comment on .
one clear objective , as i said , is that these two policies should be independent .
in addition to this , three years is a very long time in economic terms .
and for my second question .
we all talk about growth and employment .
we have the internal market .
this type of principle is going to be general for a long period .
the communication from the commission takes account of this .
can the commissioner comment on this ?
it is either five or one .
i am not going to say too much about this .
this communication says nothing about this issue .
mr president , i should like to comment on three points .
secondly , this proposal is just one step .
this is very important because , with employment in particular , policies have to be structural .
the debate is closed .
if the amendment by parliament 's committee on legal affairs is adopted , there should be no problem , and it is therefore vital for us to support these amendments by the committee on legal affairs .
this is a crucial measure .
this side of the house and this committee shall continue to do that .
i will not go back over those which have already been mentioned by my colleagues .
i have two questions for the commissioner .
are we to expect anything more ?
if so , what ?
the committee on legal affairs has proposed important amendments to the scope of the regulation .
we were right not to include this in the scope of the regulation .
on behalf of the commission i should now like to address those four aspects .
the debate is closed .
not at all .
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
perhaps we now need to go a step further .
in my country and in others , it is the regions that set support for employment programmes .
we will , however , give all due consideration to your comments .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
finally , i would like to point to the need to change the legal basis of the programme .
nevertheless , the current situation must not prevent us from trying to improve it .
since i am one of the representatives of the commission in the convention , i shall certainly support parliament 's request when the matter is discussed in the convention .
and , over and above this objective , we need to encourage the whole of local society to get involved , as the commissioner has already said .
everyone is in agreement .
why ?
i should just like to tell my colleagues how important this is .
perhaps we should put more pressure on our member states to get involved .
mr president , at the moment i can do little more than thank the rapporteur and the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities for this excellent report .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
finally , a few words on one of the instruments of social policy , open coordination .
we hope the commission will support us in this .
the first year , 2001 , was a special case which we discussed last year .
unfortunately we do not have to vote on these issues at this stage .
employment is the european union 's number one priority .
i should just like to reply to some of the members ' comments .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
iraq
very significant humanitarian aid is therefore being provided to iraq .
the un security council is dealing with the international community 's position on the iraq issue .
that is something quite specific .
good !
we must all respect the authority of the united nations and of international law .
( applause )
( applause )
there can be only one european approach .
the third question is what the consequences are .
( applause from the right )
these questions are very important for this debate .
we believe this is the best way forward .
that is your job .
there is also another point of view .
that is the key issue for my group .
that is far more important .
but where is it ?
secondly , i will take up the points from this morning .
i believe that the decision to take action has been made .
( applause from the right )
how long is this to continue ?
moreover , i should like to ask whether there is agreement in the council on the policy in relation to iraq .
mr president , first of all i welcome this debate this morning .
however , we in the european union must be central to this .
i would ask for your support in this .
my second point is one of concern .
what can we do ?
i call upon the commissioner and the council of ministers to set up that office today .
mr president , because time is short i will start by saying what we need to do .
what discussions have been taking place in the council ?
this is the reality of the situation .
what do they want to do with iraq , what can they do with iraq ?
we know nothing .
which position must they adopt ?
that goes without saying .
a war against iraq would not be fair , appropriate , or effective .
mr president , commissioner , mr president-in-office of the council , at the end of this debate , i am left with a number of questions .
this is a major problem .
and what conclusions will we draw if nothing , or something , is found ?
i just want to refer to a number of questions that we need to face up to .
what do we do then ?
can you turn that into an acceptable principle ?
i am sure this will not be the last time we debate this issue .
mr president , on a point of order .
the debate is closed .
i am sure we will not .
i can speak for the european commission .
i shall return to all these points in order , if i may .
what we shall ask for is greater transparency in the way this money is used .
he made this very point .
water .
then , of course , women 's rights .
my second point concerns the comment i made earlier in the debate on iraq .
i think that we have done the wrong thing .
the motion is to refer this text back to committee .
the rapporteur has asked for the floor .
i now put the motion that the text should be referred back to committee to the vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
that is why i will be voting against it .
transparency and rules at european level are also important .
. ( it ) i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work .
the report says that unemployment is too high .
this is sufficient reason for me to vote against the proposal .
there have indeed been changes .
there is really nothing more to be said about that matter at present .
at the same time there has to be proper control and management of international funds .
i would , however , just like to focus on three points .
only humanitarian aid has been seen so far .
( applause on the right )
there are , however , many practical actions that the european union can establish .
mr president , let me make one or two comments in reply to this debate .
i want to make three other points .
we must ensure that they get proper priority in our development assistance and development programmes .
the next item is the joint debate on :
i hope we can achieve the objectives , with which i am in agreement and which are to be found in parliament 's report .
the report is excellent .
i know that honourable members will understand when i say that this subject is one of particular interest to me .
specific policy actions will be taken in the common framework .
this is no longer acceptable .
we are now a year on .
some progress has been made , but not anything like enough .
across the world ?
the security of the region is of crucial importance for the world as a whole .
on that you have our support .
in my view , every democracy in the world should have a place in these international institutions .
there , are , though , a number of problems .
what is the european union to do with this region ?
i completely agree with the rapporteur that the only true basis for economic and social progress in the region is to respect human rights and the rule of law .
madam president , president-in-office of the council , commissioner , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , i agree with the president-in-office of the council : this is a good report .
therefore , the form of cooperation that i would also like to see develop must be of another kind .
the who is a community of independent states .
these key issues have been developed further in recent years .
i have some experience of environmental issues .
i have already mentioned the environmental aspect , which is a global issue .
more cooperation is needed in this area .
despite this , a great deal still needs to be done .
this is a positive point .
i really do consider that important .
what have we achieved in europe by means of this policy ?
it is an excellent document .
one final word .
we need both of them !
thank you , mr president-in-office of the council .
the debate is closed .
i believe that a better society could be the result .
there is , however , a need for further efforts .
mr president , i would like to thank the president-in-office for his response .
if not , why not ?
this is precisely what the role of the european council is according to the treaty .
mr president-in-office of the council , many thanks for your response .
so it is in order for people who have been members of other eu institutions to express an opinion in their present position .
this is question time and concerns questions to the council .
i thank the president-in-office for his reply , from which i understand that the council really is aware of the problem and is making efforts in the right direction .
i understand my colleague 's concern very well , but i would like to stress that parliament has taken up the matter , and a special committee has been set up .
what does he take us for ?
i would also ask him to avoid doing this again .
mr president-in-office of the council , i thank you for the information you have provided .
that is good , of course .
i cannot .
we are not going to start a debate now .
however , we do not know how many rural women are coming in .
i cannot say any more than i have already said , because this is the way things stand .
several members have asked to speak .
i thank the president-in-office of the council for his response .
subject : better regulation
the institutions would then , on the basis of this , discuss the practical content of the specific actions of the agreement .
how will it do that and who will it get to do it ?
i should like to have given a clear answer .
it is precisely that which is to be discussed .
of course , this will have to be discussed .
in the past , i have even seen a situation where the council was given one answer and the commission another , and they play on the fact that the presidency changes .
mr president , again i would like to thank the president-in-office for his response .
i have said this , and the council will continue to do so .
i can say no more .
thank you , mr president .
that is certainly our approach .
we share this view .
but we cannot give a clear answer at this point .
the debate is closed .
second : the lack of information .
i would just take issue with him on one point .
we must improve this situation .
this would create a connection between europe and the people of europe .
i do not need a public answer from you now , ladies and gentlemen , but i would ask you to think it over .
it could , therefore , be considered that the ' europe direct ' service , created by the commission , is a success .
i fully agree .
moreover , that alone is not enough .
many amendments were accepted by the council , and some of them propose again particularly important , not to say essential principles . here are some of them .
in this regard it is important that amendment no 10 actually goes through .
furthermore , certain amendments approved by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy are not acceptable as they stand .
in my opinion , only the public concerned should be included .
i turn now to access to justice .
the commission therefore cannot accept those amendments .
amendments nos 3 , 4 , 11 and 12 can be accepted in principle .
the debate is closed .
recent serious problems concerning food safety in the eu
the next item is the commission statement on the recent serious problems concerning food safety in the european union .
however , this success was achieved at a very high cost .
we all consider the food law a major step forward for the protection of human health .
( applause from the right )
why should that be ?
because of our agricultural policy , of course .
he is quite right .
i do not know what makes people do things like that or allow them to happen .
if we do not start to change the system in some way , we will carry on having this debate here at least three times a year .
so what can we change about the system ?
what is the situation with legislation on waste ?
will the commission go to the european court of justice more quickly ?
is that too much to ask ?
no , it is not too much to ask !
mr president , food safety will , without a doubt , be high on the agenda in the coming years .
how often are they carried out ?
would the commission be able to comment on this ?
in fact , cooperation with the member states will also be required .
another issue is production in europe itself .
i am pleased , commissioner , that you have come to the same conclusion .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i believe that you cannot control safety - you have to create it .
i have just been discussing this with some of your colleagues .
they want it all .
i do not know .
we have already seen what can happen in the case of food waste .
i should also like to thank the commissioner for what he has said .
it is down to the farmers .
it will not help at all .
you cannot just turn your back on this problem .
the positive list was referred to by a number of people .
i shall say something about that .
a number of people also mentioned the food safety authority .
it could do with more resources , but that is an issue for the budgetary authority .
the debate is closed .
i am sure one of us will be able to come up with the right solution .
my second point is funding .
my third point concerns the european area .
we know what we need to do , so let us make a start !
but what are we , the european union , doing about it ?
we can take the new it sector as an example .
the commission communication is a step in the right direction .
i should also like to draw the attention to the importance of the citizens ' own responsibility for their education .
this should be of particular concern .
something would need to change there too .
that needs to be developed .
madam president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report .
i do , however , have a few comments to make .
perhaps we could use that in future .
however , if we are to achieve this objective , everyone needs to be involved right from the start .
the debate is closed .
we are therefore discussing the first european document on this issue .
i share the rapporteur 's point of view on this matter .
until then , we shall have practical work to do .
madam president , i very much welcome this initiative .
this is also the case with the european union .
the european union has its own key policies and they are integration , integration and yet more integration .
i do not think it is .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
this was never successful .
the report therefore has no purpose .
the other reason is economic interest .
this development is , of course , welcome .
this has now been proposed , and rightly so .
this is a very serious issue , which requires a more general response .
we must encourage dialogue .
we can only agree with that .
we will continue to use appropriate measures to express our concern on individual cases .
thank you very much indeed , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we must support their demands .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
how serious does it have to get before effective action is taken ?
that is the reality .
the european union must therefore play its own role .
what should we be doing ?
we should do what we have decided to do .
mr president , just a few words .
i will certainly report the views of parliament to member states on this particular point .
the debate is closed .
i have voted in favour of the report but against approved amendment nos 1 and 2 .
the following change has been proposed :
mr president , i think this is a matter of common sense .
as everyone is in agreement , i have nothing more to add .
( applause from the right )
( applause from the left )
mr president , on a point of order .
mr president , allow me to go back to your reply for a moment .
it needs only one political group to request a debate for that debate to take place .
mr president , thank you for giving me the floor .
i hope so .
( applause from the right )
that is not enough .
i would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the great interest she has shown in dealing with this initiative and on the excellent fundamental work she has done .
furthermore , i believe that the initiative we are discussing is important .
therefore , an appropriate solution needs to be found as to how to carry the work forward .
i am sure we can find one .
it is really two reports in one .
it is very important that parliament has a full role in the legislative process in this area .
we want high standards .
with regard to today 's report , i thank and congratulate the rapporteur for the content of his report .
of course , we want community procedures for asylum .
our internal security is also at issue , of course .
how , then , do matters look in reality ?
in quite a few of the eu member states , for example , national , instead of common , measures have been taken .
that is something with which i agree .
pressure on the asylum system is indeed considerable .
let me make some comments on specific points .
the next item is a joint debate on the following two reports :
it is also part of our work to promote access to justice for all .
i believe that all the groups will be more or less in agreement with this report .
it is a very good report .
many thanks !
the debate is closed .
that is something that is now to be brought to an end .
the commission 's proposal was a good one .
this is all to the good .
that is what we must also achieve when it comes to the area of food waste .
the debate is closed .
decision on urgent procedure
and
as there are no problems we will deal with it this week .
we cannot have one set of safety and consumer protection measures for ourselves , and another set for others .
i would also thank my colleagues in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
i can therefore not see why we cannot do the same .
my speech will focus on what we believe to be the most important aspects .
we have to focus on that .
why is it such a problem ?
this is the wrong way to view the situation .
i should like to ask the commission a question .
we can never have too much safety . on the other hand , we can have too little .
that is the situation that applies .
what i state in the report is that we shall respect this .
i believe there is no question of our doing that .
it is a system of this kind that is required .
we cannot adopt that amendment .
of course we are not .
it is with this in mind that i have prepared this report .
further attention will be given to this issue in international negotiations .
the commission is not therefore able to accept this amendment in its present form .
for that reason , the commission cannot accept the amendment .
this part of the amendment cannot therefore be approved .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , what we are discussing today is actually a technical measure .
it is against the law , and we will therefore be taking you to the court of justice if necessary .
i am sure that the majority in this house will support that .
why , actually , do you want to do this ?
this resolution makes that very clear .
we call upon you not to implement this measure .
tell them that we are serious about this .
some of us are too .
we have certain powers .
we are talking of something quite different .
ladies and gentlemen , i thank you for this debate .
i thank you for your support .
that is what i would like , but i have not seen it happen yet .
that is what you have heard today .
thank you .
the debate is closed .
mr president , first of all i welcome the report .
that is something we have to do away with , and there have been amendments on the subject tabled by this house in this budget .
thank you , mr president .
one of the aspects involved is the legal basis of this proposal .
we know that a great deal goes wrong .
yet , it is not possible to make this data public .
why ?
for what purpose ?
this makes no sense at all !
i cannot accept this , commissioner !
this is very important .
the first one concerns the legal basis .
i have three points to make .
that is why this amendment is not acceptable to the commission .
it is about how public the area of agricultural policy should become .
it is about all these things .
we will bring this issue up again .
these are key areas .
but the most important issue here today is transparency .
that possibility does not exist and it is a possibility i want to see created .
this is a fact .
parliament has decided in the committee on development and cooperation that this should stop .
mr president , i do not want to discuss what has been said .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
mr president , might i just ask you to give the floor to our committee 's rapporteur on this area , so he can say a few words on this report ?
it is certainly not technical !
there is still much to do , though .
( applause from the left )
( applause from the left )
i do not want to start a debate .
this initiative has yet to be implemented in the member states .
it should remain this way .
why is that ?
this is a serious matter .
the same goes for its responsibility .
' .
why has this happened ?
are there any comments ?
are there any other comments , ladies and gentlemen ?
mr president , we have never done anything like this before and i welcome the opportunity to open this debate .
no doubt during the debate you will be asked questions concerning what you think of some of those amendments .
is that true ?
i would also like to thank the president-in-office for being here .
i also think we should address this issue in the convention .
mr president , the eu 's administrative budget has for a long time been one of the eu 's major budgetary problems .
the council , parliament and the commission are agreed that what is at issue here are political priorities to be adopted by the eu .
but , of course , we also have other priorities in addition to these .
the commission has decided on sustainable development as the third focus of its attention .
the member states also have their part to play in this , and there is a need for good cooperation in this area .
a new instrument has now been created for this .
this must also show itself in the budget .
i speak , of course , with particular reference to the structural funds , but i also have others in mind .
thank you for your attention .
some of our group wish the commission every success in its reform of the fisheries and agricultural programmes , and some do not .
it should not be proposed that money be given away when it is not legal to do so .
however , i do have a few questions in this respect .
i should now like to turn to the enlargement and the eu budget .
allow me to make one final point .
thank you , mr president .
now , we know a little about how matters stand . from now on , we all share the responsibility .
next , the political groups and other members will speak .
the commission will close the debate on this first point .
great effort will be required in terms of cooperation and control between parliament , the commission and the member states .
on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs , i must express our concerns regarding the implementation of the budget for the european social fund .
thank you , mr president .
this is a good example , though .
what is the commission 's view of the future of the cohesion fund for the candidate countries and for the citizens of the member states ?
this is one reason .
the citizens of the european union do not have enough information .
we must see that the european citizens do not vote no , because they understand what the european union is about .
no change is required this year , then .
why is this , commissioner ?
i would like to know if the commission and the council are prepared to support us in this direction .
we support the increase in resources for cooperation with third countries .
that is how it should be too .
i would like to focus , in particular , on two issues . firstly , security and enlargement .
the 5 million was not proposed again this year .
i can tell you that this is the number one priority as far as the candidate countries are concerned .
let us now move on from justice and home affairs and discuss information and communication .
that is why we proposed a new approach .
no one can .
but , to do this , we must have the necessary human resources .
we will now have the debate on the areas of external action .
secondly , the quality of aid .
secondly , we want more transparency .
let me take each of these three points in turn .
the second issue is nuclear safety .
in my view , better budgetary control is needed here .
these are our priorities .
this is all we really need to say at this point .
that is why you do not have a clear answer .
i would like to return to the global health fund .
( applause from the left )
my question to the commission is whether it is prepared to do that .
for this more money is needed right away .
this has had the full support of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy .
we all understand why .
i have a question for the commission .
you must agree that it will be an important project for years to come .
i then have a question for the council .
can you give us your opinion on this ?
the best solution would be to put it into the budget as a whole .
i could not agree more .
i would draw your attention to one point in particular , namely the conditions for cooperation with the developing countries at a political , economic and cultural level .
we are now beginning to see the problems of the office not being completely independent of the commission .
that is what the amendments by the legal affairs committee amount to .
i am speaking out like this because i believe this programme to be important .
violence against women has also become an issue in the budget .
i ask for your support .
employment is an important issue .
unemployment is on the increase in the eu .
what does this mean in practice ?
the committee on legal affairs and the internal market is also responsible for issues relating to the internal market and enlargement .
ladies and gentlemen , where is the sense in all this ?
the president-in-office is already aware of my request .
however , there are two issues that concern us .
why ?
i hope that on international women 's day next year , i will be able to report on progress here !
after all , the negotiations on the enlargement budget are now well under way .
all i can say is that this is a decision for the european parliament .
the commission has put forward a different proposal here .
thank you very much for your attention .
we now come to the reform of the agricultural policy .
we would therefore like to support this .
i think that the commission will go along with this .
we simply have to try and find sufficient funds here .
this is also absolutely essential if the community is to be able to continue its fishing activities in third countries .
i should also like to mention this once more .
this too is a very important question .
nor is that the aim .
i hope that the european parliament is able to support the commission in its efforts to change and reform the policy in the future .
that should be enough !
i know that there is any amount of discussion about this .
my next question concerns the food safety authority .
when are you finally going to put pressure on the council to let us have the food safety authority ?
we have to ensure that this is a focus of research work , and we have done so .
i am very pleased with this result .
thank you for your attention .
we have never done anything like this before .
in the main it has been successful .
i should also like to thank the president-in-office .
it has never been done before .
all in all it has been a good debate and i should like to thank all those who have taken part .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
a few words on each of them .
mr president , i am very much in favour of this programme .
that is the idea behind the opinion of the committee on budgets .
after all , this was a very successful programme , which achieved a great deal over many years , even if the focus is now rather different .
here , less is more !
the objective is positive .
i find it hard going even when i am reading the text !
why must we do that ?
action is also clearly needed at eu level , not just at a national level .
i therefore value this line of approach .
this is extremely important .
mr president , i welcome this excellent initiative .
let us not get carried away here .
for i cannot .
the debate is closed .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
it must become much more effective .
first of all , administrative coordination must also result in coordination in the working environment .
much still remains to be done and this is set out every year in the commission 's common report and guidelines .
what will their scope be ?
the social partners are called on to implement the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value .
agreed !
that would be wrong .
it is clear that many member states still have much to do to reduce high levels of unemployment .
what is needed is the political will to make it happen .
i share the commissioner 's view that the employment strategy has been successful , as far as we can see .
nevertheless , there remains a lot to be done , just as the commission 's document states .
unemployment is still too high .
it is only fair that we should have democratic control , both at european and national levels , where these important issues are concerned .
that is not something we can support .
it is also essential to ensure coordination with economic policy .
there must therefore , of course , be better coordination , and i am able to welcome the initiatives the commission is working on in this area .
i will mention two .
will i be required do the same job as i did before ?
what does it really mean ?
account must also be taken of the consequences of enlargement for the current labour market in the european union .
we also want the guidelines actually to be implemented .
that is why this is , in my view , such an important item on the eu 's agenda .
and then there are women .
i think it is up to the union to try to change this .
account must , therefore , be taken of these issues if we are to achieve positive results in the creation of jobs with rights .
mr president , at a time when unemployment is high in the countries of the european union , it is vital to draw up a european employment strategy .
i would like to focus on three points .
the first is the basis on which the employment strategy is being developed .
clearly , the employment strategy takes account of the needs of companies , both large and small , and the needs of the workers .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i shall now turn to the report .
this is policy both in europe and in the national member states .
the same cannot be said , unfortunately , of the social partners .
so what can we do at european level ?
positive measures need to be developed in the form of action programmes within organisations .
first : we need to know where we are now and where we want to be .
the debate is closed .
this is why i voted against the report .
the next item is the joint debate on :
the private sector will be more involved .
this is an important issue on which we must continue working .
the world bank and the world trade organisation should also be involved .
i will mention five .
the negotiations were indeed difficult .
the eu will continue to promote its positive agenda on trade for the benefit of developing countries .
that is what i will do .
the eu must continue to take the lead .
the cooperation between commission and council was also a very positive experience .
there are few who actually come up to it .
there are , as yet , few proposals on how to go about this .
we adopted this approach for two reasons : first , because this is what the world required .
a question that is even more important , in my view , is : where do we go from here ?
it is high time we did !
the eu set the agenda time and again .
we cannot , therefore , expect great results of it .
firstly , monitoring is not sufficient .
i am quite aware of that .
it is absolutely essential that we put our own house in order before we tell others what to do .
this agreement on a point of principle was achieved very quickly .
how ?
however , we should act quickly on this through the eu .
we know how the private sector is going to be involved , but how will different levels of government be involved ?
unfortunately we do not have the instruments .
i welcome the initiatives that the commission took on sustainable energy .
i look forward to initiatives from the commission in these areas .
that , though , is the responsibility not of the commission , or of parliament , but of the united nations .
will parliament receive reports on development ?
despite this , some positive results have been achieved which have been mentioned in this debate .
it is not , however , the eu that we have to thank for this , of course .
i should like , if i may , to comment on two or three other points which perhaps received too little attention .
that is a fact .
and why not ?
for the policy which we , the united states and others will apply ?
instead , nothing was done .
why ?
the question is , of course , why europe has achieved so little .
we can start with this in europe .
when will this happen ?
so there is something included in that .
so things are making progress .
all this is quite positive .
there is one new aspect that is very important : the water and energy initiatives are eu initiatives .
there is no certain answer to this , just as there is no certain answer to how we should approach this area .
we do not have one , we are trying to create one .
that is where we are .
this is not how it is in reality .
nor should we regard this debate as simply a discussion between members of parliament and a commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
i have received a motion for a resolution
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote :
i am sure the house will agree to that .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
rights are , and shall remain , individual .
this is up to them and their members .
the most important points are :
unfortunately we do not .
for this reason also , i have not been able to support the report .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
the eu has fully supported this demand .
unfortunately , this proposal has still not been developed .
for our part , we shall do our very best during our presidency .
there is firstly , for example , the institutional framework for the common foreign and security policy .
enlargement will have a major impact on the common foreign and security policy .
over the last six months we have made some political progress .
how much longer must this go on ?
thank you very much !
( applause )
in that context and in that part of the world , this is something that must be taken into account .
( applause from the left )
this particularly applies with regard to iraq .
( applause from the left )
mr president , in addition to what we have been saying over and over again for some time now , i would like to make two comments .
this is why the role of the european union is so important .
the parties must move forward .
let us take , for example , the issue of external and internal security .
that is what makes the convention so very important .
( applause from the right )
we welcome that .
however , the report does not say when this is all going to happen .
my conclusion is this : we have come a long way , a lot has been done , but a lot more still needs to be done .
( applause from the left )
foreign policy is one of the most important areas in which we really need strong european cooperation .
we must be clear in our demands and values .
( applause from the left )
'
you have proposed absolutely nothing !
the european parliament is not the place where we will answer the question ' what can be done ?
'
i hope that other member states will follow this example .
why is that ?
in other words , the eu can do a lot more with the same money .
that must be our objective !
what are these general principles ?
first , respect for the european political culture .
secondly , respect for international law .
mr president , i should like to thank parliament for this debate .
parliament is right about this .
we have not in fact had such a plan before .
i really do not think so .
it cannot end in any other way .
he will not achieve his objectives in that way .
this has been said quite clearly .
the european position is that the security council should be supported .
thank you .
at present , we are trying to get information from member states on all of their projects .
so be it .
why did the international community set up this international criminal court ?
that is precisely our group 's position .
we must get our own house in order .
i entirely agree with him .
the council is working on a compromise .
there is therefore a great deal of work still to do .
this should be sufficient guarantee for the us too .
the list goes on .
this is wrong !
it was an article that the united states itself proposed .
that is of course the principle .
that is of course the crucial point .
that will not happen .
mr president , i did not receive a clear answer from the council .
it is absolutely right that it should be taken seriously .
the european union and each member state can and must do far more .
the problem is cultural and serious .
madam president , i am in favour of the solidarity fund .
these are very technical matters .
next i would like to look at some key questions the proposed amendments deal with .
why , therefore , should we not also take this step ?
what do the people say ?
why do we not use common sense ?
that is what i support .
the debate is closed .
i tabled a few amendments for the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , some of which were accepted .
most of the technical amendments we put forward were accepted .
i understand that at some stage the commission will be coming back with proposals on that .
this approach is in line with the principles of better regulation .
i would like to thank the rapporteur and parliament for their efforts .
i believe that water is also the life of the future .
there are technical aspects .
this does not need to be done with a directive , however .
why is that ?
the new technology is in place .
unfortunately this is not true .
the debate is closed .
to date , there have been no such developments .
that is my answer to the question .
that is why i unfortunately only heard part of your speech .
that is one of the reasons .
that is why we asked these questions .
we promote it .
i also thank the commissioner for his reply .
in this case we are not talking about the single european market .
what has that done ?
so why should this be any different ?
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
three of these call for special mention .
i do hope that parliament 's representatives in the on the european convention will support these proposals .
i thank you .
obviously these problems will increase with enlargement .
however , this year the debate is different for two reasons .
i should like to mention some of them .
i know that is the case .
i hope that we in parliament will support these changes when they reach us .
why waste time when it is a question of doing something that will benefit people ?
it is an area in which we have received a great many proposals .
some people have already referred to this and i was parliament 's rapporteur .
what is the way out ?
that needs very serious consideration in future .
the present system does not provide legal protection .
there is a long way to go .
i welcome that .
we must have institutions that fight for citizens ' rights in the eu .
in my opinion , this should be the main consideration .
the debate is closed .
let us now consider the organisation of the negotiations .
i would like to thank the honourable members for their work .
in short , our common objective is to use trade for development .
this is particularly important .
the commission is wrong there .
there are difficult issues for the european side as well and what right do we have to prevent that being discussed ?
we fully share her point of view on the matter and we support her .
it also means that consumers pay far too much for food here .
i do not expect many people here to agree with my view about political integration in the european union .
the debate is closed .
( applause )
"
it is important for industry to be given clear basic rules .
unfortunately , you know what then happened , as i do .
the only way to deal with these issues is through common action at a global level .
without the eu 's efforts , i do not think the summit would have made as much progress .
well , that is not the case .
how far is europe prepared to go ?
that is why we have voted against this resolution .
we do not however agree with certain points in it .
at all events , the common foreign and security policy is an intergovernmental matter .
paragraph 20 : the report should not encourage the member states to increase their defence budgets .
we say no to war .
are there any comments ?
but i wanted to say something quite different .
so there would have been time enough for question time .
( the minutes were approved )
however , in itself competition is not a measure of fair competition .
how can we achieve this objective ?
that is the objective we decided on together in the framework directive .
that is the point of this resolution .
i do not think it will come to that .
we should be able to find a joint solution before then .
i should just like to say to colleagues from the committee on culture who are present that this is not an issue for that committee alone .
this question was developed entirely within their committee .
that is far from the reality .
we are not there to do that .
( applause )
( applause )
mr president , on a point of order , i wanted to say that i was going to vote against .
that is too much !
( applause )
mr president , i think there are more fundamental questions to be asked following on from what our colleague said .
it simply is not necessary with the new rules .
i believe that would cause no more problems : we would not waste our time and we would be working under very good conditions .
and just what has been decided ?
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
the first item is the commission report on the progress made towards enlargement .
( applause )
the commission will do everything necessary to ensure that this objective can be achieved .
however , further efforts are needed .
this is the task of the convention .
i also think it is necessary in terms of the public debate in our member states .
( applause )
it is their own decision .
( applause )
( applause )
why did you do this without us ?
( applause )
( applause )
( applause from the right )
it is important to state this clearly , and it is the same in other groups .
( applause )
( applause )
some say they are in favour of enlargement but not yet .
the agricultural sector and the interests of the rural population are important to both the eu and the candidate countries .
today is not the end of a process .
yet we must show those countries that they will benefit from enlargement from year one .
you are aware of all that , yet you say nothing .
that is not the solution .
we need to talk about this .
this is the problem of funding for enlargement .
how can that work ?
let us come now to enlargement .
clearly , they need to reform .
and why ?
i know that will take time , but is that our aim ?
( applause )
we would welcome that .
there is little point in being all things to all people at all times .
it does not provide for the accession of ten new member states .
( applause )
of course not . enlargement will continue .
the principle is there .
that is why i shall vote against the report presented to us by the commission .
europe means talking to each other !
this article applies to us all .
the contribution to this by new members may be significant in this respect too .
however , more can be done , and we can work on this together in the coming months .
the hope is that the security council will reach an agreed position on the matter .
so much has been said .
mr president , these issues are very relevant in the current context .
parliament 's resolution of may 2002 made a proposal which still has not been taken up .
and can we do anything , while the decision is that of the member countries of the security council ?
this much is clear .
then let us make a start !
how are we to prevent this ?
the second question concerns the un security council .
in short , i do not have a clear answer to that question .
mr president , two minutes , six points .
we should at least ask it to consider the various possible consequences .
we must not accept the use of the security council as an instrument .
i also want to talk about the united nations .
and just what does that mean ?
it is clear from these that decisions on such action must be taken by the un security council .
what would happen then ?
he has other priorities .
if we are to encourage him to think about his own people and about peace in the region and in the world , we must take a united stand - in this parliament too .
the debate is closed .
they are therefore a key political priority .
although education is the responsibility of the member states , we also need common actions and objectives .
this would be a good example for other policy areas .
i hope parliament will support the report .
we already know this and we should be prepared for this .
this is my second question .
if this were the case , this would , in my view , be wrong .
i think that a number of things can still happen at eu level .
this too is therefore a problem that i believe we need to consider .
we often do much better than we think .
i share the view that has been expressed on stability .
we should not step in and make changes every year .
i also share the view as regards focus .
these issues are important .
we must have proper democratic control .
all of this is important .
this is why i have tabled an amendment to promote this .
as you see , mr president , it is possible for us to have different views .
mr president , allow me to say a few words about employment strategy .
that is a practical question .
this means that a great number of things are actually in the balance .
the question is , however , whether we are always able to do this .
at the end of the day , as the commissioner has said , it is a question of those who want to move around throughout the european union being able to do so .
we need to go further , however .
that is , and remains , the main task .
i would thank the representatives of the council and the commission .
the debate is closed .
the next item is a joint debate on :
this is also an important question for the council and the commission .
i would be pleased if the council and commission could answer this question .
for these reasons , i would like to ask everyone to vote for this agreement .
on this , i ask for your support !
that is the most important thing .
the country also has a terrorism problem .
madam president , by way of conclusion i wish to address a few words to the commission .
i also believe it is important to take account of urgent social issues .
europe therefore has a responsibility .
what will our assessment be of the economic , social and environmental consequences ?
this has to be said !
how can we accept this ?
what does this mean ?
i would like to draw the commission 's attention to a number of points .
' why ?
that is not our role .
let us adopt this resolution .
this work must have support .
madam president , first of all , i would like to thank you for having given the commission the opportunity to open this debate , to take part in it and to provide its own contribution .
thank you , commissioner .
for a start , we have to create a legal basis ; one is in place today .
i believe we will be able to come to an agreement .
in any case , i would like to thank the commission and the council for everything they have done .
i doubt whether there will be any solidarity left between the states .
we call upon the council to take up the proposal from parliament and the commission and make it a resolution .
it is in these cases that european funds are most needed .
commissioner , you put it very well and i fully agree with you .
in this case , though , it makes sense , and in this case it is right that we should act in this way .
two are required - the legal basis and the budget line .
not all the problems in europe should be allowed to become european solidarity issues .
i certainly hope so .
perhaps we should discuss this issue further .
it is sometimes regional .
the debate is closed .
i am talking about the period for the implementation of this essential directive .
thank you very much , mr president .
this is why , mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i ask you to vote in favour of this text .
the debate is closed .
where does that get us ?
the debate is closed .
this is what will be effective in the long term .
the first amendment is one that the commission can accept .
i can agree to amendment no 10 .
the debate is closed .
it is due to this cooperation alone that we were able to reach a good compromise in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
secondly , we feel it is important that the member states should be able to add to the sectors and activities included in the system .
mr president , i speak on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
this , i think , was an excellent solution , and one which the committee on legal affairs and the internal market also proposed .
i wish to thank both the rapporteur and the commission in particular very much for this .
in case there are any colleagues here who do not know , it is my role to report it .
mr president , i too should like to start with a few words of thanks .
parliament is taking an important step today ; it is the council 's turn next week .
i do not think so .
it is costs that are the main point under discussion .
i now turn to the second area , which has to do with fair conditions .
with this instrument a market is to be created .
parliament has , however , proposed a number of amendments .
we all agree about what our aim should be .
it is clear that , however , within this context , our rapporteur has done some very good work .
i will return to this subject in a moment .
in my view , the commission proposal does not meet these criteria .
mr president , like many here i welcome the report and congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done so far .
what the commission has proposed does not actually meet its own conditions .
i want to make the following points .
that is why it makes sense .
i would rather that they did not .
mr president , this is a report that is certainly of great importance .
i congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent job he has done in a very difficult area .
it is one of the key issues in this draft directive .
i hope the commission can accept both those amendments .
we will therefore need to take measures that go further than those we have discussed up to now .
the debate is closed .
you are very welcome .
' .
we believe , however , that this can happen further down in the legislative process .
this amendment should be supported so that these discussions can take place .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
it is therefore paragraph 5 with the change i have just mentioned .
i think the different groups in the house will agree to this .
) .
unfortunately , not all of them were accepted .
most people , however , do not want this , with good reason .
why not use this directive ?
why not use the existing legislation ?
why , therefore , has nothing happened ?
i do not think that it is the role of the commission or of myself as president of the commission to apply rules in that way .
( applause )
we are talking about criteria that apply to all the member states , both large and small , to the benefit of all the countries of the union .
new and better rules are not enough , however .
( applause )
budgetary policy is the responsibility of the authorities of the member states .
that is true today and it will continue to be so in future .
those , ladies and gentlemen , are the proposals we put forward within the convention .
i call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to support these efforts .
( applause )
it is a success for us all !
today is one of them .
( applause )
this is the current situation .
the second is that the rules are the same for all countries , large or small .
first of all let us be clear on what we should not do .
that is what we would like to hear from the commission today .
let us be clear .
the financial crisis is even more serious in europe than it is in the united states .
( applause from the left )
when europe , or member states , take the wrong decisions on energy , we must say so .
let us continue !
( applause )
economic development and social progress are not their concern .
as they say , people who do not take themselves seriously are not taken seriously by others .
we have one - the commission !
and , first of all , was a rule necessary ?
i agree we need rules that apply to all the countries of our europe .
how is growth achieved ?
that is the point at issue , and that is what we have to deal with now .
that is a view that i share .
in my view , that can only be the commission .
they are wrong !
wrong !
we only have to look at today 's debate to know what i mean .
this should not be what the discussion is about .
what should it be about ?
no , indeed not .
that is what i believe to be the most important thing in the long term .
( applause )
i am sure you will agree with me .
i am sure that we all agree on this .
a currency is as strong as its economy .
mr president , i would like a further debate to be held on this matter .
( applause )
this is unacceptable .
i still have no reply .
rapporteur .
from our point of view , however , that time has not yet come .
i will make my third point to the rapporteur later on .
unfortunately , however , this is not true .
this is not the case .
i shall content myself with making two points .
paragraph 2 also concerns me .
the debate is closed .
if we are to have a common asylum policy , we have also to deal with these additional needs and it makes sense to deal with them together .
in conclusion , i should like to thank all my colleagues for their serious work and commitment on this report , whether we agreed or not .
why ?
the objective was to have common rules adopted that would make the eu into an area of freedom , security and justice .
that is something which quite a few eu countries know already .
that is not all , however .
so , mr president , i believe that we must stop .
we do not know .
we do not know .
this is not a responsible course of action .
we , for our part , believe that our main task is to protect our people .
if the member states do not want to pay a high price , they must find a way to change this situation during the next intergovernmental conference .
this , at least , is our view .
we need to be absolutely clear where they are coming from .
on this side we are quite clear in our approach .
we will support this report .
let us be quite clear about this .
this is an issue which i believe is relevant .
this is true .
the debate is closed .
the commission 's proposal is a good one .
i think that this is a proper approach .
that is something i should obviously like to see right now .
these are the reasons why we will be voting against the motion .
the debate is closed .
that was the first thing that they said .
i think that we will be able , with the european commission and parliament , to support the resolutions of the european council as well .
it takes a great deal of time .
this is certainly one of our great concerns .
your resolution and that of the council will support our efforts .
work has already been done in this area , as part of the 2000 programme .
another aspect is training .
we have tabled two amendments which we hope the house will accept .
i very much support that .
europe must help where it can .
you do not have any time left .
secondly , the private sector must be involved more than it has been before .
that is why we should do more about this .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy by :
let me start with the objectives of the proposals .
there are three .
why ?
experience has not brought any major problems to light .
why is this so important ?
how will this happen ?
we cannot change this situation by our legislation .
some members wanted to question the principle .
industry therefore needs to guarantee the protection of this data .
this is a very positive point .
that is not possible , because we do not have the money for that .
i want to draw attention to just three points .
the commission is right - information is available to some , but not to all .
i hope that you and the council will think again on this matter .
i hope the commission will also follow my opinion .
this is not what we want for european citizens .
it is not for nothing that an increasing number of companies have decided to carry out their practical research and development in the united states .
i hope that the health ministers will also be involved in the future .
i see this as important .
we should put a stop to this .
this is unacceptable .
agreements can be reached about the research agenda during the price negotiations .
all that remains for us to do is to make a small , yet important , step .
why is this ?
( applause from the right )
i think the compromise which has been reached is a fair one .
we must get the balance right .
much has happened since then .
mr president , commissioner , i will focus once again on a number of what i feel to be key points .
it is either a single market or it is not .
the second important point has already been mentioned many times , but we cannot consider it often enough .
that is why i agree with the conclusion reached by the committee .
think about that .
have i really voted to provide better health protection ?
i will comment on six groups of amendments .
it is clearly better for the consumer .
i just do not believe it .
to keep the balance , we cannot support it .
i understand that people are against the american system , but we have never proposed it .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i would like to draw attention to some of the key issues .
secondly , trade .
this has been a subject of some debate .
i cannot therefore accept amendment no 12 .
nor can i accept the other four amendments .
i am pleased that the council 's proposal has taken into account the views put forward in parliament 's first consideration of the matter .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , we can vote on this next report .
this is the last time i shall take the floor , mr president .
president .
'
what did i see in this play ?
that has nothing to do with this house .
i have already mentioned the problem with implementation .
unfortunately we have to say that this is not always the case .
the council and the commission propose major new initiatives .
i believe this is what will be the main point in negotiations with the council between the first and the second reading .
this also applies to the common foreign and security policy .
these will be required with or without enlargement , especially when it comes to parliament .
in a very short time , this has become a parliament with considerable legislative power .
this also means that we will receive some of this money back one year later .
for me , all this is also about a kind of investment in good relations .
so thank you for your support .
let me turn now to expenditure on the common agricultural policy .
that said , i should like to refer to parliament 's and the commission 's budget .
we would like full transparency in the council in future and for all its legislative discussions to be open to the public .
on the commission budget , there are four relevant points .
that is a request that we have made .
that is something that applies to all the eu support programmes .
it is hard to do all this .
this has to do with the commission 's administrative reform .
this particularly concerns the structural funds and external actions .
with these comments we are prepared to give the draft budget our support .
that was the last job of the previous parliament carried out for the present one .
take agricultural policy , for example .
one such example is enlargement .
mr president , we would like to add three comments concerning the budget at this reading .
my third and final comment concerns fisheries .
had that system applied today , i am sure we would not have voted for the budget that we now have .
i am one of those who voted for it .
we have serious problems in these areas and we need a real sense of cooperation .
i will focus on just two technical aspects .
i would add something further .
i will mention one more issue : culture .
more work therefore needs to be done on them .
how much will enlargement cost ?
that is the question .
let us also , therefore , consider the budget in this light .
i hope that this amendment will also be supported by a sufficient majority .
we have all made every effort to meet the budgetary conditions .
allow me to address a second issue , one on which i also ask for the support of members from the other groups .
we cannot have a situation where enlargement cannot at the end of the day take place in practice .
the community is called on to act here .
madam president , i will do what i can .
first point .
this situation must change .
everyone has said it , this is the last time there will only be 15 of us .
the balance of political powers will be such that we will not be able to carry on this way .
perhaps more specific questions should be asked of the council .
i would therefore like to focus on two points .
madam president , i too would like to express my concern over the lot of development aid in the budget .
this will be achieved through the political and budgetary transparency of this objective .
however , we want to do even more .
what are my general comments on the budget ?
the public , however , should know what quality is .
i hope that this will continue to be the case in future .
this is crucial for enlargement too .
however , i will return to this issue in a moment .
i see a further problem .
we should do something about this .
however , the member states must do what they can .
it is not just that our budgetary priorities are wrong , the system is also wrong .
i would like to stress this on behalf of parliament .
until very recently , the commission has also done very little within the framework of its aid .
i welcome this and thank the committee on budgets .
this is the first area that has been adopted .
this amendment has also been adopted , for which i thank the committee on budgets .
the standards are very high at the moment .
this is the only amendment that has not been adopted .
i should nevertheless like to express my thanks on behalf of the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities .
thank you for this contribution .
the debate is closed .
i agree with the question in this respect .
i would therefore ask the commissioner the following questions :
who would not be ?
who will expect us to do that ?
i would like to thank the commissioner once again and wish him every success in his efforts .
so this is an issue of general concern .
i should like to thank the commissioner for her response .
if not , why not ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
does the commissioner then think that we could apply this position to the case we are dealing with now ?
this is also the main reason why the council took so long to adopt this framework decision .
i share your view that we need to give priority to actions of this kind as far as candidate countries are concerned .
thank you , commissioner .
thank you very much , commissioner .
i fully agree that this issue is not just relevant to animals under transport , but to all animals .
subject : food safety
if it does not , should it not have such powers ?
significant financial support has been made available for this type of research .
commissioner , that was a very long , quite technical answer .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together .
that is the main problem .
this would allow parties , such as the community , to keep their already existing strong legislation in this field .
that is fundamental as far as i am concerned .
unemployment did not increase as a result .
thank you very much , commissioner .
( applause )
( applause )
mr president , i want you to feel at home here .
( applause )
as has been said , agreements also need to be reached in these areas .
what is all this about ?
when it comes to the common security and foreign policy , this is an area in the course of development .
that is why i tabled the amendment the rapporteur has already mentioned .
we have seen progress in a number of areas , but we also have a number of things to look forward to .
it is important to know who said what and how they voted .
i believe we could make more progress by going to the court of justice , as has been done with great success in connection with proper agreements .
i shall not therefore vote in favour of the compromise .
it is to them that their individual ministers are responsible .
mr president , i hope you will allow a point of order .
i would like to know why there has been no mention of these security rules on our agenda .
the debate is closed .
the task in hand is clear indeed .
each member should be able to understand it .
i welcome the results and we will be voting in favour of them .
commission . ( de ) mr president , honourable members , although it is for parliament to debate its own rules of procedure , i would like to take the opportunity to say a few words .
a good and clear result has finally been achieved .
this is a very good system and we give our very strong support to the compromise that the main groups have reached .
the new process will also ensure that the process does not go on and on .
that is what has happened in the past .
that is why this system is much better .
this is a good thing .
for that reason this conflict should not in any sense be made possible .
the rapporteur and i also had some good discussions .
i might add that the legal service 's opinion says the same thing .
i should also like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of this aspect .
with that in mind , then , thank you again for your cooperation and support .
the debate is closed .
first , the lack of an action plan .
next there is the issue of women : on that there is total agreement .
i support the report .
i hope that we can make progress .
we must first make sure that existing legislation in the same field is being implemented across the european union .
the text is very clear .
health and safety cost money .
that is the reality of the situation .
mr president , the commission document on health and safety at work is a good document .
i very much agree with all of that .
i agree .
i agree with that too .
we will hope together for progress .
what good is it if we have health and safety but no work ?
and it is not over yet .
as i have said , this health and safety at work strategy is an action plan for the european community as whole .
so there is very close cooperation .
now some specific comments .
it is not just legislation .
there are so many different issues in the commission 's text .
reference was made to quality .
under the strategy , each of the partners involved is required to present its own action plan .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that is something we need to address .
they need to be able to take responsibility for themselves .
i am aware that there is no basis in the treaty for doing this .
the debate is closed .
thanks are due also to the commission for the excellent cooperation we have again had on this report .
i am not going to go into that .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , what would a regulation such as the eu 's financial regulation be without rules for its implementation ?
this change will mean an increase in their power and responsibility .
finally , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work .
the new financial regulation 's rules of implementation , should , according to previous rules , have been decided on in agreement with parliament .
the draft has nothing to say about this .
it was far more a matter of culture .
i ask you !
that , commissioner , is just not acceptable !
commission . ( de ) mr president , i would like to return to some of the points that have been made .
why is that the case ?
we will , however , have another opportunity to discuss these issues .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i now wish to say a little about enlargement .
as i have said , we can expect it to be very difficult .
what is true for ireland is true for us all .
the first item on the council 's agenda will therefore be enlargement .
on this i ask for your support .
this is a very important point .
this is where we need a new instrument , because we find ourselves in a completely new situation .
i believe that everyone must take on their share of responsibility and do their share of the work involved in this .
what matters now is that everyone should understand that the enlargement project is political in nature .
this , then , is where parliament also has a part to play .
it would have been possible to discuss them at a much earlier stage .
that is very important .
this is the responsibility of the commission , the council , and also our responsibility here in parliament .
i believe that more should have been done .
this is unacceptable .
why is this so ?
that is not the solidarity that the eu needs .
and why is that so ?
it voted ' no ' .
the best that can be said about the treaty is that it will only last for a year or two .
then , a new basis from the convention of the time will be put to the vote .
no , thank you , mr president .
i am talking about the total lack of basic consideration .
why then , should we now try to make it think it is ?
let us add solidarity to this list .
why do they do nothing ?
i have just two or three comments to make as time is so short .
however , there are other questions that keep being asked in my country .
we will have to do that at a later date .
allow me a final comment .
i feel that more needs to be done in this respect .
the last word has not been said on this subject .
i believe that it is extremely important that the council and the commission are clear on this subject .
this is one problem .
it is a question of our children and children 's children .
it is a question of a better environment .
all of this is our responsibility .
i would like to see a change in agricultural policy .
it is not the candidate countries ' responsibility , but our responsibility - the responsibility of all of us - to make a change in agricultural and structural policy .
time must be found for that later on .
' keep at it !
i am , however , concerned about another matter .
the people must also be involved .
my final comment is about turkey .
as far as i am concerned , we can look forward to the european council with confidence .
no new conditions .
now is the time to bring that investment up to an entirely new level for the future .
we also welcome the commission 's proposal for a further progress report six months before accession .
now we are almost there .
finally , a word on turkey .
enlargement is not a matter of meeting a certain number of technical requirements .
( applause )
and , in that case , we will not need it .
( applause )
thank you , commissioner .
she was very pleased to be here in such a short time .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
( parliament adopted the decision )
( parliament adopted the decision )
before the vote :
this proposal has our full support .
we share the opinion of the convention 's working group on this .
are not many of these issues really political in nature rather than fundamental legal rights ?
i cannot , therefore , support the draft .
the eu did not stop at words .
where do we draw the line ?
i am pleased , therefore , that this idea is expressed in the motion for a resolution .
these considerable efforts must not and will not stop there , however .
here the european union clearly has a crucial role to play .
this is what we have done so far in the fight against terrorism .
it is here that our contribution to the fight against terrorism will have the most impact .
we face a different problem today .
i think it right that we should be speaking here in terms of a general convention against terrorism .
if the rules do not provide for that , they should .
that is the context in which today 's debate should be considered .
thank you , mr president .
in this regard , i would also like to ask you how the negotiations with the united states on cooperation in this field are going .
this is not enough .
would the commission and the council be able to comment on this ?
this role is crucial .
trade , aid and cooperation in international organisations are also important .
a good deal has been done ; a good deal more can be done .
i believe that we should pay great attention to this issue .
i do not actually believe that this is so .
this is also the case here .
i agree with most , though not all , of what has been said here .
all are very necessary .
what more can one add ?
but this is not the case !
madam president , terrorism is unacceptable .
we are all agreed on that .
the approach taken by the eu in developing its strategy for the fight against terrorism is extremely important .
there are , however , still many more measures that we need to take .
our internal strategy has in any case been successful .
what we need now is a successful external strategy .
this is what is required .
we do not need a general opinion .
we need the united states , and the united states needs us .
we share parliament 's view that we should give priority to this .
the united nations is the first stage .
i hope that the negotiations in progress in the council of europe on a convention on terrorism will be successful .
thank you , commissioner .
mr president-in-office of the council , you have the floor .
security has therefore become a major policy concern .
let me turn now to data protection .
i would like to speak on a point of order , madam president .
there too the question is : what has happened within the commission ?
you said that you had adopted a decision .
that was clear from what you said .
my question , then , is : who is responsible for this in the commission ?
i should like to focus on one aspect of last year 's debate .
i then ask myself what we are doing about this .
we also proposed specific measures .
since then , we have not expressed an opinion .
madam president , it is good that this debate is taking place here today .
the commission is doing too little here .
at that time , i was a member of the european parliament .
but as i have been asked , i will go through them all .
it was a great success .
you said that nothing has been done .
you are wrong .
that will be a major priority .
we are working in an extremely difficult field .
thank you , commissioner .
my question is what is the commission itself doing ?
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we shall hear questions to the council .
mr president , this is a point of order .
there is a third point of order , and i hope it will be the last .
mr president , it is the commission that has the right of initiative .
that is why it is the commission that must come up with a proposal .
it has nothing to do with what i was asked about and is an issue that the council absolutely cannot have an opinion about .
nor has he done so with regard to the fight against terrorism .
the rules of procedure are quite clear .
the council has not been made aware of the situation referred to by the honourable member in his question .
mr president , i thank the president-in-office of the council for his reply .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together .
subject : international criminal court
subject : international criminal court
mr president , i should like to answer the three questions together .
it was a position supported by the candidate countries .
no way .
the question is : will this apply to other countries at a later date ?
i really do think that this is , all in all , quite a good result .
i heard the minister refer to a common position .
with reference to the first question asked , i want to say that a common position is a common position .
if things go well , what agreements could be reached ?
has the council not received this information or has it not been able to ask for it , or has it not wanted to ask for it ?
that is the first thing that i would like to know .
subject : human rights
that is something quite different .
i welcome this report as a step in that direction .
i would like to support the comments he has made .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my thanks go to the rapporteur .
commissioner , i should like to ask you one more question .
this is unacceptable !
the debate is closed .
i hope that the house will accept this report .
but rural development is the main focus of the report .
the european union is , of course , part of the solution .
that certainly is a call to action .
for this reason , i want to ask that we set priorities .
why ?
this was the aim , mr president , of the amendments tabled by the committee on agriculture .
these have been adopted by the committee on development and i ask you to give them your support .
the debate is closed .
this is the case now .
that would be very wrong .
as you know , it will take another five to ten years before we have community legislation on this area .
the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy has adopted 15 amendments .
we would like to see a solution as quickly as possible .
i am extremely pleased with the proposal , therefore .
i believe that we have every reason to congratulate ourselves .
the objective of the proposal for a regulation is the protection of the environment and human health .
mr president , i shall make short comments on some of the amendments tabled for the vote tomorrow .
the commission can accept all these amendments .
the joint debate is closed .
i would particularly like to welcome and draw attention to the statement in the common position .
it is important that we are clear about this objective .
we therefore welcome the fact that the common position clearly states this will not happen .
the programme has much to offer .
the debate is closed .
welcome
( applause )
this is clearly a success for parliament .
european law must , however , be the same for everyone .
i believe that today 's text will provide a good basis for effective cooperation between the european commission and the european parliament in the future .
as we are all aware , recent events have shown how important these issues are .
the directive does not do that .
( applause )
we have come to agree on important matters .
a ban should apply to all the markets within the scope of the directive .
i would like to congratulate him .
that is not what the directive says .
that is the basis of our political work .
( applause )
this situation , though , is rather different .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
as far as possible , the commission will present a proposal in this regard .
member states will give special support and attention to these projects .
we must take account of the fact that in rather more than a year 's time there will be 10 new member states in the european union .
their concerns are also our concerns .
the council is doing what it always does , what it does best - nothing at all .
they make money !
so what should we do with the public funds available to us ?
this is not a good use of european public funds .
it has been included among the projects of common interest but not yet among the priority projects .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for this report .
they are in russia .
the next item is the vote .
there is no enlargement cost in that case .
that is actually a new amendment to the draft budget and should be voted on at the beginning .
i do not think that requires a vote , but i just wanted to point it out to the house .
mr president , this should , i hope , be the last time i speak in this vote .
mr president , i hope this will be the only thing i have to say concerning the resolution .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is because we think that the eu 's money can better be used in other areas where it is really needed .
these are the reasons why i have fully supported this report .
i congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work .
i want to ask three things .
the commissioner would say that it is very important .
this is not to say that it is not important , but it is not at the level of true negotiations as yet .
and i would say that , in terms of the eu 's new political agenda , there is a set of three objectives in this field that must be achieved in the short term .
what shall we do ?
what are the objectives ?
the same applies to our role in relation to the developing countries .
we have today voted on the eu budget at first reading .
what is the commission 's current view on this ?
that is all i have to say .
and so we should .
this is a fact and we must face it .
europe has to take the lead again in this discussion .
how does the commission feel about this idea ?
one point , which has not yet been raised today but which i consider very important , is the question of monitoring .
i would like to comment on some of the points that have been raised .
what about a wto initiative ?
so first things first .
our main objective is to protect the environment .
how do we create equal rights for citizens throughout the world ?
perhaps this is something which requires further debate .
we achieved this .
so much for the procedure .
the commissioner said as much .
and another thing .
that i quite understand .
at the same time , they say that they do not know enough about them .
perhaps there is a connection .
i shall comment on two further issues that have been raised .
this debate will certainly continue .
i thank you for this debate and i am sure we shall continue it at a later date .
thank you commissioner .
the eu and the united states share the same basic values .
the debate is closed .
how can they speak about progress !
all of these developments are important and very welcome .
we do not need good will , however ; we need results .
let us think for a moment .
not a moment before , however .
communication and dialogue will help here .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i therefore hope that you will support our amendments which refer to these points .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we are agreed therefore that we do not need a vote .
firstly , control is required of all countries .
independent control authorities already exist .
thank you commissioner .
what will the agreement in question look like ?
i would like to make two points .
thank you , mr president .
these proposals are a response to that .
and if they do not reach them the waste will have to remain in their own countries , that is clear .
that is the situation of the candidate countries .
this measure would make eur 2 000 million available .
we also welcome these two commission initiatives and i would like to ask the commissioner a question : how have these proposals and initiatives been received by the candidate countries ?
how have the candidate countries received this proposal ?
furthermore , they are aware of the situation created by enlargement and also the need to provide the citizens with more information and transparency .
why is the problem of safety being raised ?
you are well aware that this is a key issue .
that is the first thing i wanted to say to you .
that is the objective reality .
( applause )
the european parliament and the presidency have a joint project .
enlargement is the key to the future of europe .
we made a number of crucial decisions .
we will meet them with an offer of practical negotiations and call upon them to make the last crucial effort .
the presidency had three objectives for the brussels summit :
firstly , we wanted to bring about agreement as to the basis for the final enlargement negotiations with the candidate countries .
i am pleased to report that we achieved our objectives in all three areas .
the eu 's policy is clear .
these were among the reasons why we were able to make the necessary decisions .
( applause )
we made three crucial decisions .
we also reached agreement on the total level of funding for structural fund initiatives in the new member states .
the answer is : hard work .
the european council 's decisions in brussels have created a basis for further negotiations .
( applause )
ladies and gentlemen , you are now all aware of the results of the brussels european council .
there is no time to waste .
last week we presented the conclusions of the brussels council to the representatives of the candidate countries .
the reality of enlargement is taking form .
( applause )
i wish you much success in this .
( applause )
i believe it is fair to point this out .
we cannot .
what are elections for ?
why ?
there are now ten .
you said that we had to continue working on the reform of the agricultural policy .
will he be out of a job ?
are we going to continue working ?
we are talking about our future .
( applause )
i should like to address three issues , mr president-in-office : first of all , turkey .
i therefore believe that he would have seen the brussels summit for what it really was .
enlargement has therefore come at a good time .
mr president , the brussels summit was above all about enlargement of the european union .
the same principle of course applies to the european union .
so we must not allow the candidate countries to think the process is over .
yesterday , in the foreign affairs committee , we agreed to do just that .
in third place comes the issue of turkey .
perhaps , above all , it is a decision for the member states and not for other countries to take a decision as to when a date should be set for turkey to start negotiations .
we shall take note of what has been achieved .
i have three further points to make .
i hope the council and the commission will support this because it will help to reform the common agricultural policy .
no doubt there are reasons for this .
that cannot be for real !
i know that .
( applause )
( applause )
no , they do not .
thank you , mr president .
i would like to express my thanks for a good debate .
i would just like to make a general comment regarding some of the points raised .
all our work , including the difficult negotiations , has taken such a long time precisely because of the need to respect these principles .
he is doing great work and let us hope that he can continue to work in that direction .
i will comment on the objective .
that is what we , the countries and the citizens of the european union , have all wanted to see .
it is possible that the debate on the resolution will end today and that the vote will be taken either today or tomorrow .
ladies and gentlemen , i have little more to tell you at this point .
it is precisely here that there are difficulties .
it is the human needs involved that give great cause for concern .
( applause )
i think that this would be a major step forward .
( applause )
i welcome every opportunity to work with you to create this new world ' .
for the time being , i shall put forward a practical proposal .
that is right and it is true .
both these things are true .
given our position , this is wrong .
mr president , the world must avoid war .
unemployment is increasing .
ladies and gentlemen , we have been discussing three issues .
i believe that we are all agreed on the first principles , the general principles .
what is it that we want ?
we have already done that .
their efforts must continue .
what did we want to see ?
three things .
these three things have been achieved .
this is not a problem for the united states alone , but for every country in the world .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate
with regard to the resolution proposed , i shall first consider market management aid .
that is why i would ask the house to adopt the resolution tomorrow .
these will be increased only by 1 % each year .
in this , we will of course be taking full account of the brussels decisions .
let me add something on the subject of parliament 's draft resolution .
the paper has also been discussed within the committee on agriculture and rural development and in a number of relevant working groups .
before i start my review i would like to thank the european parliament for its discussion of the matter .
i would like to comment on the more specific market sectors .
thank you very much , president-in-office of the council .
of course .
now that i have said that , let us continue with our debate .
we must vote against these points we cannot support , and i hope that they do not go through , either .
is that right ?
this will not be possible if you do not actually provide the means to implement this policy .
this is not the kind of rural development we want .
small farmers cannot take responsibility for everything .
i believe there are four particularly important principles .
the first is price protection .
the third principle is stability .
we must not only talk about it ; we must give ourselves the means to implement it .
for now , mr president , this is far from the reality .
that is what we have to do , and this is where the commission will make its contribution .
i can do no more about it than you .
we are not content for our views to be put to one side - we want to be involved in this decision , and we want to know what is going on .
i did not , of course , know the reason for this .
there are four reasons for this :
mr president , the common agricultural policy is out of date .
thank you , mr president .
i would like to ask you , madam president-in-office , when you think these proposals will be implemented .
i hope we will have sufficient opportunities to do that at a later stage .
we welcome and support its objectives .
following our debate on the council 's agreement , reform is all the more necessary .
it is not possible for all farmers to pay in equal measure for the reduction in the budget for agriculture .
we need to think long and hard about this .
that is all very well and good .
in conclusion , i would like to ?
i want also again to thank the european parliament for its reading of the commission 's communication , and i understand that a decision may be made at the meeting tomorrow .
how long will the reforms take ?
thank you very much , president-in-office of the council .
and why ?
this was not the case .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the european union needs to be in line with other developed countries in this regard .
that is therefore what will happen .
the joint debate is closed .
finally , two more points which parliament is absolutely right to ask for , time and again , and which need attention .
more of the same is no longer enough .
on the subject of kosovo , ladies and gentlemen , i would nevertheless like to make some things very clear .
they have many problems in common .
only one thing is clear , and that is that we must not back off from our commitment .
our efforts to provide these countries with economic and political support are much needed .
the debate is closed .
there are two things on which we can agree .
one principle we agreed upon was that of ' one programme - one fund ' .
this will have to be taken into account .
other criteria , including , in particular , the unemployment rate , should be taken into account .
the same applies to community initiatives .
i would like to stress two more points of great concern to me .
there are many problems and areas of concern , and i would like to mention one which is of particular interest to me .
in this respect i agree with the rapporteur , who has tabled an amendment on this point .
we in this house want to help you .
having said that , a great deal still remains to be done .
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on this very important report .
regional policy is extremely important for today 's eu , but also in terms of solidarity in the eu of the future .
we must make effective use of currently available resources , something which also applies to future structural fund budgets .
the debate is closed .
it is 15 years since the idea of an internal market was put on the agenda .
we must find a solution to this .
the internal market for financial services is also extremely important .
in the face of global financial markets , regulation must take place at eu level .
what is in it for them ? how does the market work for them ?
thank you , mr president .
we all know , for a start , that this is true in financial services .
this must , in my view , be that of the social market economy .
i can say that i agree with several of these views , and i should like to make the following comments on them .
it is an extremely important matter .
that is one of the reasons we should all support the internal market .
the debate is closed .
even in the eu , we have legislation that should apply in this case .
i would like to make two points .
we believe that after this discussion and after the report , the commission could draw some new conclusions in the light of the results .
this is why i believe that there is always an opportunity after an individual case to move forward and to take into account the particular needs of groups of workers across europe .
the debate is closed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the council should actually do something about it .
we must congratulate ourselves on this .
in my opinion , however , the result could have been even better .
first of all , greater transparency .
we shall see this more clearly tomorrow .
the brussels council did not say a word about this .
in fact , the problems remain .
moreover , we do not wish under any circumstances to appropriate more money to the common agricultural policy .
that is why i shall support amendment no 10 .
i voted in favour of this report , together with my group , because i believe that , overall , the cohesion policy is a good one .
i also regard the candidate countries with concern .
but i take note of your request .
you do not even know whether they are going to take part in this debate .
i have just seen that the commission is present .
( parliament agreed to the request )
( parliament agreed to the request )
no change .
i consider this to be an extremely important issue .
we shall see how members vote over the next few months .
nothing has happened to date .
do you not think you should do something , mr president ?
mr president , this is serious and i would ask you to look into it .
i take note of what you have said .
it is still open to the groups to look at the order of discussion on that day .
mr president , on a point of order .
and
my questions to the commission today are : what action does the commission propose to take ?
many things have happened over the past ten years .
i said that no progress had been made in ten years .
why has no progress been made ?
it is more than that . it concerns competition , the internal market , culture and fundamental rights .
i would like now to speak on behalf of my group .
we must not let it become one .
that is why we have put the matter to the commission .
the european convention must also discuss this .
there are two or three points i would like to make in this regard .
this is the case almost throughout europe .
we therefore call on the commission to take note of the new difficulties and to propose a directive .
that is why all of us here today , and my group in particular , believe that it is necessary to review the need for a directive .
those issues are already there .
this is for reasons that all of us have very much in mind obviously .
that is the question .
in other words , the only thing we cannot do is nothing .
that is not the case !
the court considered that this general ban did not have the legal support of the treaty .
far from it .
but , unfortunately , the legal framework does not allow us to go that far .
i therefore call on you to vote against all the amendments by the committee on legal affairs .
they do so for other reasons .
today , no one can say that they are not aware and this means that everyone is to be held responsible .
in short , the law has rights too .
as you can see , this goes much further than the currently proposed european regulation .
it is clear that my group and i share her point of view .
that is what we are saying in this case .
let me first of all deal with some of the technical issues .
indeed there are different views in member states .
we have done that .
but do not just take my word for it .
of course , it is .
i would say to them they should follow the views that are expressed by the court .
the debate is closed .
it is of great importance to the european financial market , to the internal market , and to financial services .
it makes a fundamental contribution to the stability of europe 's financial markets .
the business and financial markets are global markets .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
madam president , commissioner , i should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done and to thank him for this .
it is absolutely crucial to the common fisheries policy that decisions be made on the basis of very clear scientific data .
people have already taken the pressure off on their own initiatives .
this simply cannot be allowed to happen .
they call for more technical and human resources .
they want more money for research .
reform is not the solution .
at that point we were all united , and i hope we are in this case as well .
i believe that we have a very important political responsibility .
this is a fact !
the measures and proposals presented should have come about a very long time ago .
that is why they are now absolutely necessary .
we already know that this is the cause of the whole problem .
what shall we do , therefore ?
i think we must be able to adopt the commission 's proposals .
i now hope that the commission will support this proposal .
that i will not do .
why should this be so ?
the common fisheries policy goes too far .
it does not make sense .
we have a common agricultural policy .
it makes no sense .
it would make a lot more sense .
we must do something about it .
do we need to make fishing resources part of the common fisheries policy ?
and if they have not carried it out , i do not know when they are going to do so .
let me return to a number of specific points .
it therefore demands a specific approach .
that is what we have put forward .
i would also like to say something about the question of monitoring and the implementation of fisheries legislation .
this , i believe , is where we have to go down a new road .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( the minutes of the previous sitting were approved . )
i agree with you that we still have much to do even after these things have been achieved by all parties .
that is why it is the political criteria that are crucial here .
( applause )
before they become member states , however , further efforts are of course required .
some work remains to be done in the accession negotiations .
i would now like to say something more about turkey , an issue that will also have a part to play next year .
that is something i want to make absolutely clear .
the commission takes the same view .
the same applies to the commission .
( applause )
on behalf of our group , i have tabled a final amendment , which i would like to put before you now .
there too , i believe , we in the european union have to take some share in investment .
'
i believe it to be important that rural and regional development should be a key focus of attention .
by which i mean a democratic turkey , like all the other european countries .
( applause )
the implementation of policy costs time and money .
we cannot ask more from new member states than from the current member states .
it therefore cannot be said that nothing is being done in this area .
so much needs to be done in so many areas .
the eu , however , is different ; this is far more involved .
things are different now .
this makes it necessary to use all available measures that might help to prevent it , and to step up the social dialogue in the candidate countries .
these have to do with two very real problems .
the second issue has to do with turkey .
i therefore see no reason to talk in terms of this or that date .
what does this mean in practical terms ?
the candidate countries must focus their efforts on certain areas .
what kind of a european union will we have following enlargement ?
the same applies to the european union .
we must support these negotiations . we must hope they turn out well .
they are just as european as we are .
this is a considerable step forward .
when i say ' we ' , i mean the member states .
thank you .
i should be pleased if this house would support this urgent matter so that we can achieve good cooperation with this important part of europe .
my main concern is for public opinion and the state of mind of others .
i do not agree with such points of view .
mr president , these are without doubt important times .
i have two questions .
for ever !
almost the whole of europe will now be united as a community .
that also applies at regional and local levels .
it is our turn to put our words into action .
that would be in the interests of us all .
i also want to say thank you for all the work that has been done by the commission , the european parliament and , especially , the candidate countries in order to make enlargement possible .
what is the commission 's view on this ?
after all , what does the eu stand for if essential principles such as the rule of law are not in place ?
this is a question for the council .
it will be of benefit to them , and it will be of benefit to ourselves .
how welcome are we ?
we are not actually just the party that is giving something .
mr president , much has already been said about turkey today .
but we are not under any pressure to move .
we are making this offer even now .
that is the main problem .
i should like to welcome the candidate countries to the eu .
we must apply the same terms , conditions and principles .
mr president , i would like to make three comments .
we all hope that it will be a success .
may everything go according to plan !
let us work together to make it possible .
three years later , the european parliament cannot now , as some amendments demand , try to change this .
even after accession the new member states will have to continue with their policies of reform .
this is far from being the case .
i should like to thank you for your commitment and support .
thank you very much , mr president-in-office of the council .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
honourable members ,
the third major priority for the coming year is economic policy .
having said this , we welcome the three political priorities set by the commission and we would like to make the following comments :
a final point on the economic and social priorities .
they set political priorities .
i will believe that when i see it !
while i am of course pleased that sustainable development remains a priority for the european commission , there is more to it than that .
i do not in fact see many initiatives in the area of environmental legislation .
it is clearly based around important priorities and that is a point in its favour .
indeed , there are a number of issues which are absolutely essential for our future action .
i fully agree with her .
an agreement with parliament is clearly necessary .
we are extremely concerned about this .
this is something which should concern us all .
this is the way we must approach the issue .
i agree - as i said before - with this too .
there are only three proposals that go in the right direction .
they are not new legislative proposals , though ; they are amendments .
mr president , i have a few specific questions about development policy for the commission .
when can we expect to see this specific regulation ?
for this reason , we must also be able to implement some difficult reforms at the same time as enlargement .
in the old member states too it is necessary to give attention to the implementation of eu legislation .
labour costs are high while at the same time there is considerable unemployment in europe .
mr president , the fight against terrorism has been , and must continue to be , one of our priorities , if not our main priority .
it has presented all the initiatives it should have presented .
what we need to do is to begin to take decisions in this area .
i do not find this acceptable .
mr president , i have two questions .
we will have common training programmes .
that means that you will also present the proposals that you have presented to us very quickly in future .
the first of these is the enlargement of europe .
secondly , there is the issue of stability and security .
on a more positive note , let us look at energy .
i think we can agree on this , commissioner .
i will say something about that in a moment .
we do not want to do that , nor are we able to .
even if we did want to , we could not take it away from you .
that really is not acceptable .
that has to be the right way forward .
we must make sure that sufficient resources and measures are available in this respect .
the same goes for the court .
we have done well but we could still do a lot better .
it is the whole problem of the european and world framework , the place of social issues , human issues and citizens .
this is really the main priority for me and for us .
secondly , we want the full integration of the countries that are going to become the european union with us .
at the moment this is something we are really talking too little about .
then there is our role in the world .
we could even ask why this did not happen earlier .
we must continue along this road .
in this regard , i would like to say that the commission will continue to work with parliament and also , of course , with the council .
the commission has recently presented a proposal for a european return programme .
the time has now come for the council to decide .
yesterday in the general affairs and external relations council this was again the case .
i know this because i was sitting over there as a member of parliament last year when the commission presented its legislative programme , and at that time the way of working was completely different .
the presidency is very pleased with the commission 's proposals .
i believe that we can reach agreement on that .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
before the vote :
before the vote on paragraph 3 :
i take note of your comments .
that is why we vote .
before the vote on amendment no 10 :
mr president , i am the rapporteur for this part .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
this is a second reading .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
joint motion for a resolution
it is now brought into line with the decision we took on the earlier amendment .
i therefore voted for it .
this assessment , however , concerns european integration as a whole .
1 .
2 .
it is in practice an additional consumer tax .
it is actually the responsibility of the state to provide proper social protection .
we voted against this report .
this is the focus of the report .
to this end , the commission must make available financial resources that are appropriate to this fight .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i believe we should support the fundamental health protection efforts being made in the european union .
make of that what you will .
we support this initiative , the main aim of which should be to protect public health .
these are the reasons why i agree with this report .
there is a good reason for this .
take the example of drugs money .
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
i cannot , of course , accept this situation .
that is something about which there can be no doubt .
the relevant services have therefore made the necessary change .
we will then be able to be absolutely sure about the result .
this was a key point for both parties .
among these , the european commission regards justice and home affairs as particularly important .
other important issues were discussed at the summit .
however , this should also be included in the conclusions of a summit of this kind .
i would like to encourage you , mr president-in-office , and the commission , to act with this in mind .
if you do that , you will have our support too .
this must not be allowed to happen .
right now it is important for us to discuss the effects eu enlargement will have on cooperation between the eu and russia .
another question of current importance is the development of cooperation in the area of energy .
the eu is not now a party to the project and it will pay in the future .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to make four comments .
finally , i would draw your attention to an environmental problem .
i should like to ask the commission and the council very clearly how things stand with the negotiations on this treaty ?
my group does of course support the accession of russia to the european union .
i think that we must make this a priority .
russia is large enough , it can look after itself .
this is a very important commitment .
this is not the problem .
we are certainly not talking about a war on terrorism - we are talking about the creation of terrorism .
we have a share in the responsibility for all this .
of course not .
it was precisely this , moreover , on which the dialogue with russia at the summit was based .
unfortunately there has been no progress .
we have others who deal with the political side of the discussion .
this is one of the areas in which we have been quite successful .
i was there two years ago .
the conditions are thus in place for taking the agreement further .
how can you regard this as cooperation ?
these elections are a step in the right direction .
let me make one comment about the cooperation agreement .
i believe that is our common hope .
mr president , what we have here is something of a difficult discussion .
this is where all the problems start , however .
finally , i have one further question .
perhaps it will be possible to give an answer to this question as well .
i just cannot understand that .
that is the problem we face .
much therefore still needs to be done to develop the basis for social dialogue .
and according to the council 's legal service , that does not provide a legal basis .
it simply requires some further discussion .
but let us see whether we can make any progress with it .
i do not want to start a major legal debate here in parliament .
the question is why the commission proposed this .
some of the legal aspects of the proposal have already been referred to .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on :
that is clear .
well , this discussion is by no means at an end as far as we are concerned .
and we have not yet achieved that final result .
we support the motion for a resolution adopted by the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
a majority of us will be voting in favour of this report .
mr president-in-office , you were quite right in saying how necessary financial integration is , but that financial stability is also necessary .
no , we are also dealing with how we can make further progress with legislation .
a social market economy in good working order is one of the conditions for accession of the candidate countries to the european union .
however , we must measure the process as a whole in terms of whether the objectives are being achieved .
we must ensure that regional aspects are taken into account .
we all agree that this issue requires democracy .
but before taking this step , a proper assessment must be made of these measures in the light of experience .
if there is enough political will in the council , anything is possible .
if there is a real political will in the council , it can be done .
that is very important .
the council and parliament have a common responsibility in respect of the major problems that we see in the member states in these areas .
again i agree with her .
i agree .
i agree with her .
may i also say that quite considerable progress has been made by the candidate countries .
she also says that there must be a political will in council .
in principle , i am in favour of the commission 's proposal .
these are some of the major issues that parliament has considered .
i will address the various amendments proposed by parliament at the end of this debate .
overall , then , we are pleased with the report which was voted on in committee .
we have tabled amendments on this issue , and i would ask you to support them .
there are , however , different views in our group also .
i would like the commissioner to address that particular point .
there is much i welcome in this report and i would like to thank the rapporteur and the commissioner again .
that proposal will take account of your concerns .
i am pleased that a number of you agreed with that proposal .
the commission can accept these amendments .
commissioner , i have a further question .
the debate is closed .
let me start with the objectives .
what are the main objectives of this proposal ?
there are three .
the assessment has to be for use in the eu .
for that reason , we propose that up to 15 years of the use can be outside the community .
finally , the new scientific committee .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , you are quite right .
all it requires is that we know about quality and content .
what is in it ?
what will it do for me ?
let us welcome it .
my group will therefore support it .
finally , mr president , i want to stress that scope must be allowed for the different needs of different member states .
in this context , the following points are especially important .
first of all , there is the issue of quality and safety .
however , the others simply are not good enough .
the debate is closed .
all this i can see in the proposed directive .
there is one final comment i should like to make .
last week , parliament in germany agreed on a system that is very much in line with the directive .
there are problems in practice , however .
i hope we can create a more effective framework here .
in my own group , two issues have been of great importance at this first reading stage .
mr president , i do not believe the commission has done enough to address the problems in different member states .
we wish to return the directive to the commission for them to do that assessment .
this is precisely what we are trying to change .
we have considerable experience of it in the country where i come from .
that is a fact .
this we must prevent . this we cannot accept .
i would like to ask whether they would like to go through their own amendment list one more time .
more jobs can provide both .
that is absolutely right .
that is not so .
i therefore thank the commission for the fact that a good proposal has been tabled .
that is actually what it is all about .
the provisions should therefore apply from the first day .
we want to find that balance .
mr president , i should like to start with three general comments .
i should like if i may , mr president , to comment on specific amendments in order to give the commission 's position .
i shall deal first with the amendments that are acceptable and then with the amendments that are not .
the debate is closed .
the united states clearly lead the field in this area .
we state quite clearly that there are opportunities in both sectors ; in other words , there are opportunities in agriculture as well .
there are many reasons for this .
there is a very different view in the developing countries , however .
this is not what is said here .
that is what it says here .
there are two points i should like to make .
it has only been implemented by four of the 15 member states .
the consumers do not want them .
where is the market , in reality ?
we have no products which are successful and are accepted in the market .
let me come to my real point .
it is not enough to state that we have to be successful , we must also act .
we want sustainable agriculture in developing nations .
but we need to know that the proposed solution is not the cause of even greater problems .
the debate is closed .
i could not agree with you more .
my third point concerns labour market policy .
my final point concerns monitoring .
this monitoring at national level was the subject of a report which i supported here yesterday .
madam president , i want to say a few words about the opinion of the committee on budgetary control regarding this report .
thank you very much .
we should like to see increased cooperation between our committee , the committee on budgetary control and the european investment bank .
we are concerned here with public access to environmental information .
first of all , i should like to comment on the role of the bank .
finally , there is the question of monitoring .
crucial progress has been made within both these important areas .
i am extremely pleased , moreover , that parliament is now making this demand .
that is something i absolutely cannot accept .
in this regard , there is therefore no problem .
these activities , naturally , also need monitoring .
i shall be able to say more about this in committee .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
madam president , in the short time available , there being two reports to be discussed , i will try to consider a number of different issues .
i would , however , like to make a few comments .
international action , to which you have just referred , does not present any more of a problem .
a great deal of progress remains to be made .
allow me to add a few words on competition policy as a whole .
i hope parliament will support our amendments and i look forward to even greater progress in the years to come .
many significant events have taken place since then .
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , european competition policy and the commission 's work in this field have been vital to the creation of the single market .
at the same time , i would , however , put forward a proposal that i hope the commission will consider .
application of the rules in full is a measure that does not do any justice to the development of a social market economy in the accession countries .
how do you propose to find a fair solution to the problem of state aid in the accession countries ?
i believe that the vote on the two reports later on will also show that we do not agree with what has just been said .
my second point concerns a request that i wish to make in the field of regional policy .
much will change for the present eu of 15 , for the old member states , and it is right that it should .
we need to discuss this and we need to do it in good time .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( applause )
i consider this to be an unacceptable situation .
i hope that you will receive a positive response .
the debate has already taken place .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that will be the first line .
although this solidarity fund is a necessary guarantee , it is not a sufficient one , however .
i can see that i have not been completely let down in this .
i would also like to thank him for his efforts in this matter .
in some areas , the commission goes much too far .
i think it should be the other way around .
for this reason we cannot vote in favour of the report .
' why ever not ? ' , i asked her .
'
equal pay for equal work , certainly , but the key issue is the reference point .
no they are not !
these , in short , are the reasons for my vote against this report .
this and this alone is the reason why i have voted against this motion for a resolution .
these elections were not democratic .
that is why i tabled an amendment in this regard in committee , but unfortunately it was not adopted .
an initiative of this kind is also currently being proposed for the eu .
this applies all the more if services of general interest , public services in other words , are considered as part of the economy .
the commission is therefore able to support amendment no 1 .
the commission cannot accept amendment no 5 for a number of reasons .
the debate is closed .
we hope to continue our effective cooperation in the future .
this is obviously a crucial question .
why is the united states more successful in doing so ?
the council and the commission were on one side and parliament on the other .
the debate is closed .
they must be put into practice now .
as a commission , we did everything in our power to prevent it .
clearly , the answer is no .
this was clearly not the case here .
we should do this . in fact , a start is only just being made .
this is also a task for the council ; we cannot do this on our own . we therefore need to improve our rules .
once again , the governments of the member states have not been equal to the circumstances .
many of them are good .
so what do we need to do next ?
we obviously need a set of measures .
now all that remains is to see if it is being applied in practice .
we need to help these people .
that is why the region and the people there need assistance from europe quickly .
that , commissioner , is the reason for paragraph 3 of our motion .
so where is the problem ?
until when ?
the legislation needs to be applied and that is the problem .
you know the result !
that is enough !
it needs to be applied .
but above all it is essential that the existing rules are applied .
i would like to say that i fully agree with the commissioner 's words and support those measures which offer a clear line of action .
and i have asked for information .
that is what i am talking about .
how many more ?
well , that is my point .
aid , ladies and gentlemen .
we are working on this .
we would be talking about more than eur 3 000 million , ladies and gentlemen .
let us hope that it does not go that far .
ladies and gentlemen , what has been adopted must be put into practice .
i hope it will be set up before the end of the year .
the second issue .
we are talking about going further .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i think that we too have a great responsibility here .
mr president , this motion is about three points .
that was true then , it is true today and it will also be true in the future !
the debate is closed .
that is all , mr president .
before the vote on amendment no 1 :
i should like to know what was their decision .
and everything is perhaps done for that .
mr president , i have a request to put to the presidency .
let us now deal with what i believe to be a crucial issue in the report : the reform of the commission .
i thank you very much for your attention .
there is still a great deal of work to be done here .
i will end with two questions .
the second is this : under the treaty , it is the commission that is responsible for the management of the budget as a whole .
who , though , in the commission , is responsible for the monitoring of the whole within the commission itself ?
( applause )
mr president , thank you in any case for giving me the floor .
i should like to start on a positive note .
it would be something we could all work towards and we would know what to expect .
i think that this will be essential in the future .
one major point that is left is enlargement .
in my view , there is only one important question left today .
i like working with you and we work well together .
but not so in the eu .
this is just the approach we take for private business .
is this really going to change this year ?
if something is wrong , it must be put right .
.
we would really like that answer .
was it you ?
what is going on within your systems ?
we want reform .
thank you very much .
i therefore believe it is better not to provide this information .
that is the reason .
what for ?
but i must say that i have found a completely different situation .
you say these changes cannot yet be seen in the final result ?
it is true , they cannot .
and do you know why ?
and therefore until next year i am sure we will not see any changes .
that is all .
turkey 's accession will follow the same principles and criteria as those applied to the other candidate countries .
agreement must be reached not only within the council ( and within the other institutions ) , but also - and this is particularly important - with the future member states .
they are a necessary part of enlargement as a whole .
i believe this goes for us all : parliament , the council and the commission .
this dialogue is very important .
that is the law of democracy and we must apply it .
in short , turkey has come a long way but much remains to be done .
the european union must encourage this process .
above all it has given them hope .
for a start , we have not yet reached the objective .
do you think i do not know that ?
i really have to tell you that one problem is the result , quite simply , of the rules we have made for the european union .
it is that problem that we have at the moment .
and now for turkey .
the law matters to us .
there are criteria for accession , and they include such things as the law .
the central question is : will it also make us more democratic ?
what are the practical demands we are making of them ?
a date for a date , however , would be the right thing to do .
that is the most important thing .
as far as turkey is concerned , we must be responsible .
we cannot decide on turkey 's accession plan now .
how about that ?
i do not understand why it is up to the us to decide who must be part of europe .
i believe , therefore , that this question remains open .
this is how we could move things forward .
the council is wrong , the commission is wrong .
just a few words about the next point on the agenda .
a great deal !
i do not believe that this can be in the interests of the candidate countries of the future member states .
we should be clear on that .
as i have said before and i will say it again , it is now or never .
at some point we must say no .
what did you actually do ?
are we really going to say that ?
we want you to meet it by such and such a date and if you do we will open negotiations .
everything should therefore balance out in the end .
we have , in fact , said this several times before .
it is in europe 's own interests to put things right as soon as possible .
i am sure that many members will feel that this question is not relevant , but i think it is .
is this the eu as a peace project ?
is this the eu as a peace project ?
but how can this be done ?
so what is the problem ?
let me make another , additional comment .
i do not think it right that this situation should come about !
i do not know about ' now or never ' , but in any case it is time for action .
concerning turkey , the basis is clear .
turkey is a candidate .
first , i will return to the subject of money .
that is precisely the problem .
we are not like that at all .
i have nothing different to say about it in private than i have said in public .
i am well aware that other views are being taken in public , sometimes even by the majority .
i should just like to make two small points .
that is why the decision was necessary .
that should also be taken into account , as i have often said .
and
we are all equal here .
it is high time .
i would like to make that very clear at this point .
what happened ?
the question of the transparency of costs is raised again and again .
but it is not the subject of this resolution .
we have made progress .
that was a long time ago .
there is a time for everything .
there is no need for us to have this debate today .
all our actions must take this objective into consideration .
obviously we find this unacceptable .
tomorrow everyone can decide which side they are on .
we are special .
but some people here do not even want to mention that .
i certainly am .
so , what are we discussing here ?
but , help is at hand !
let us be clear , there is a very practical paragraph in the joint motion from three parties that would allow a practical process to take off .
that is one problem .
today again we get no answer from the council - because that was no answer .
i said that quite clearly .
there are unfortunately too many people who do just that .
this can be seen from the fact that they do not turn up and vote .
it must be possible for these things to be done , mr president .
thank you very much .
the next item is the joint debate on the following three reports :
and
i believe that makes today 's debate crucial for the future of the fishing industry .
the commission has therefore set up a task force .
now , how is this different from last year 's plan ?
now to the structural funds .
first , there is something i would like to make clear .
i do not think so .
then we shall also have to find a way to do it .
i will not comment on other commission aspects .
we cannot continue fishing in this way , however .
what are we really doing there ?
let us all start working together , side by side .
in the short term , however , we also need measures such as those that i have just mentioned .
let us now talk about fisheries reform .
thank you all very much .
that is all i have to say .
we need to go further .
i agree with his proposed changes to the commission 's proposals .
it is about their way of life , the only one possible in many areas .
it therefore has a crucial role .
for whose benefit ?
it is up to the member states to decide on their plan of action during this time .
that is something that is very important .
however , we have not always done this in the past .
this principle is not being applied .
however , we have to consider what kind of future we want .
they demand a total ban .
parliament is on your side .
in the light of recent events , it is only right and proper that the european union , and also the commission , should express solidarity .
on that point , the commissioner should know that aid will be required .
i have said that this is too little .
we need to do more here and i am in the process of doing something about this .
it is not up to the commission to take the decisions here ; this is a decision for the council .
now to the proposed amendments .
the debate is closed .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen .
no it does not !
i therefore wish to congratulate the commissioner and the commission on the result they have achieved .
there is a better way .
the debate is closed .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what i have to say about today 's report is this .
we welcome the fact that the focus is on implementation .
so what next ?
it is about giving the european parliament not only the right to be present but also time .
and that applies not just to economic and employment policy ; it also applies to social and environmental policy .
what do i mean by that ?
madam president , no coordination , no procedure can be effective if there is a lack of political will .
i shall now turn to institutional procedures .
our priority must therefore be to establish this basis in the convention .
what is being discussed is coordination of the economic guidelines and employment guidelines .
i think that , here too , we must talk about social and environmental issues .
first , we need better coordination of economic policy , employment policy and social integration .
we really must be allowed enough time .
the debate is closed .
madam president , we welcome the important step being taken today in the field of health and safety at work .
clear progress indeed .
it is , then , a very serious state of affairs we are talking about .
this is a much discussed subject .
we have only to look to our own experience .
in the interests of time , i will make just one other point .
i agree with that .
we will stand up for common sense and vote against it .
i think there is another reason why implementation should give us cause for concern .
that is why i will be voting in favour .
the debate is closed .
the commission has already made a commitment to review the directive next year .
the data is required every three years .
there are four amendments to the report .
i would like to thank my colleagues in the committee on the environment .
i can support amendment no 3 .
in conclusion , i consider the report to be most welcome .
my thanks to the commissioner for what she has just said .
and that they certainly can .
i want to say two things .
why are we doing this ?
what will the results be ?
it will be a good day for parliament if we can do this as well as for the animals under consideration .
the debate is closed .
the victims are in the best position to be able to provide this type of information to the authorities .
allow me to say a few words on two other points .
we naturally have a responsibility to help the victims and give them the opportunity of a better life .
that , precisely , is one of the problems .
the means proposed here can make a contribution to this .
in effect we are talking about the same terms .
i wish once again to thank parliament for the support it has given this commission initiative .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the commission statement on its contribution to the work of the european convention .
we therefore have two proposals for reform .
we want to give the european parliament more power to make decisions on resources .
that is why i believe majority voting should be the rule .
there are other concerns too .
i am pleased to see this development .
i am also pleased that this is taking place in the light of day .
( applause )
( applause )
we believe it is a good proposal .
there are other proposals which we welcome as working proposals .
( applause )
i also support the proposals for law making that you have just mentioned .
the same applies to european democracy .
let us speak , however , in practical terms .
therefore , a union of states and citizens .
therefore , the debate is an open one .
i therefore believe we should give this some consideration .
you have done what you had to do and we are going to debate it in the convention .
it is at long last before us , and we welcome that .
i can see many positive points in your proposals .
we cannot and we will not go along with that !
how is that to happen ?
so how will that work out in practice ?
i would like to focus on three issues : firstly , europe has to become a global political power .
from the point of view of the small countries , that is not democracy .
why do i say that ?
we will see in the coming days .
i regard this as a very difficult situation .
if the european council is to have an almost parliamentary right of control over the commission , then the president of the commission should not be a member of the european council .
at the same time we can make effective european policy .
president of the commission , thank you for your contribution to the work of the convention .
if there is to be a president of the european union , then it must be the president of the commission .
there are good proposals for this in the convention , that go a little further than what the commission has proposed .
mr president , i do not think it is yet entirely clear how long what the commission has proposed actually is .
i would just like to say a word about open coordination .
do you start with the economic or do you start with the social ?
this is important if we are to bring this to a successful conclusion .
we must get that through in the convention !
( applause )
i feel this has been an important opportunity to develop the debate on the future of europe .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
after the vote :
mr president , i would like to propose some amendments to the minutes .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament approved the joint text )
( parliament approved the joint text )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
mr president , this has been voted on and i have no problem with that , but i had asked for the floor .
are these amendments going to be voted on or not ?
before the vote on amendment no 20 :
this article should be voted on .
this is what we did .
nothing more .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( applause )
( applause )
joint motion for a resolution
thank you .
we have adopted a resolution today .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
joint motion for a resolution
the consumer should be able to support home production , if this is their wish .
therefore , despite the fact that a few individual aspects can be seen as positive , we have voted against this report .
this measure makes very good sense for two main reasons :
since the report is in line with these comments , i shall vote in favour of it .
we therefore voted against the report .
i voted against the report .
among other aspects :
what the new member states need , however , is solidarity , democracy and public services .
i voted against this programme .
what about the other member states ?
it is high time we did something about this .
the rapporteur 's proposals are unacceptable .
so we are especially pleased that you are here today and indeed this week .
( applause )
we certainly need to achieve economic and financial integration .
( applause )
something , however , must be done .
what do we tell them ?
we believe in democracy .
i am in favour of this .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
this comment concerns a state policy decision .
i am going to do so for the next five years .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
open up your markets .
( applause )
( applause )
investment in health and education , as you know even better than i , is an investment with a high rate of return .
( applause )
i would like to thank the president .
far from it , it was a call to action .
the order of business was thus established .
work is already in hand regarding this matter .
as you said , it is not the first time that i have been asked to do this .
i will come back to you on this matter .
i would like to thank you for this .
this is a serious responsibility .
there are provisions relating to policies and others relating to the institutions .
make of that what you can .
these , therefore , are the main points .
it is a difficult subject .
i believe this is the wrong way around .
we will therefore be voting against this particular point .
in addition , you also mentioned the question of coordination policies .
i hope he will do this , at least by tomorrow .
the second point concerns the place of the social dialogue in the community .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
you will not get a majority in this house !
the debate is closed .
we think that is an important step in the right direction .
again , we think this is an important step .
we are quite pleased with that as well .
therefore , i would hope we could include this on the voting list tomorrow .
i support the rapporteur 's three amendments .
i am therefore particularly pleased to hear that the commissioner is in favour of these amendments .
i welcome the amendments that have been agreed .
for many years , this principle was not taken seriously , and we can see the consequences today .
i would also now call upon the member states to go still further than the directive , and i believe that the three amendments adopted by the committee will improve the directive still further .
environmental protection and protection for public health are clearly not the european union 's priorities , despite what it may say .
thank you very much .
the debate is closed .
why do we do that ?
the question is , why is this being done ?
is it really for the benefit of the consumer ?
is it something for which there is a consumer demand ?
this has been carried out because they do not want consumers to know about it .
you need to look at all the changes that took place in committee .
the who says so .
and what has happened ?
things cannot , i believe , be left as they stand , and the situation is unacceptable .
why , then , do they not want it ?
that is what this procedure is there for . the only acceptable approach is for the commission to draw up the positive list very quickly , and , moreover , not in the form it has now proposed .
the real need is for change in the situation in the european union .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
i want now to list some of our most important demands .
let me just say something about the voting .
i hope the european parliament will also support this proposal .
when i first brought it to the attention of parliament , i had no idea that it was going to be the success that it has been .
there were people from the united states and many other countries .
that was a direct reference to the british government .
this must never happen again .
this , however , was not the specific aim of our committee or the reason why it had been set up .
i think not .
what do we do now ?
what decisions must the european union take ?
i continue to believe that it was a good initiative .
i consider it essential that such measures should also be applied in europe .
mr president , i wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report , which is extremely important .
our committee has , on the whole , done a good job .
for all these reasons , i would ask that the house give this report its majority support .
that was the reality .
sometimes one 's conclusion is : if only i had ?
such was the impact .
this means that if we are to take european citizens seriously , we must change policy .
in that respect i look forward to the new debate on the commission 's proposals .
we must also ensure good monitoring at all times .
a political wish list is not enough .
i want finally to say a little about the consequences in terms of trade policy .
thank you .
unfortunately they were successful .
that is a good idea .
the first thing we must do is understand .
this report goes a long way to developing a positive approach for the whole of europe .
i hope that you will give this your support today .
where should it begin ?
you never know what is going to happen .
that is not right .
finally , i would like to thank the commissioner .
this must never happen again .
at that time , the commission still took another view .
at least that is what this report is saying , and i think that makes sense .
we are going to have to deal with this as other countries have done .
they have been more effective than we have been .
i do not want to do that .
do not let other people go through what we did last year .
i would also like to thank all my colleagues .
we should stress this again and again .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we have only the three amendments before us that were voted in the committee on employment and social affairs .
it is very important that we vote on it today .
there is no real problem concerning this report , so we can vote on it today .
( parliament agreed to the change to the agenda )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
. ( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , before we move to the final vote , i would just like to say a few words .
i also want to tell you why .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the military was above the law .
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
we must put an end to this situation .
it is quite simply that the report seems to think that this goes without saying .
the answer is clearly ' no ' .
not so .
despite the many positive aspects of the report , i will vote against in the light of the above comments .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
allow me to mention just a few of the most important areas including , of course , enlargement .
the necessary decisions will have been taken and implemented by then .
the second priority was to implement necessary reforms .
these were necessary with or without enlargement , especially for the european parliament .
on the commission 's behalf , i want to thank the budgetary authority for this decision .
this is an important step towards a common foreign and security policy .
that is why commission reform is extremely important .
agricultural expenditure is under control , so there is no need for significant reforms for budgetary reasons .
three issues stand out , and i would like to mention them .
i think that we have some way to go , but this is a step in the right direction .
last and not least is the question of successful implementation of the commission reforms .
for my group , this is an essential point .
from that point of view , it is quite good .
( applause )
i think that parliament has made its contribution to that process .
the answer remains in the air .
the reality of enlargement is upon us .
as regards last year 's budget , the commission had had every opportunity .
i believe that the commission must pay particular attention to that .
this is absolutely vital .
of course , my group is going to support this agreement at second reading .
as i understand these things , it certainly is not going to be from the agriculture budget !
how will things go next year ?
the first is external trade .
i believe these programmes to be of great importance for the future .
the debate is closed .
what is going to happen next with this report ?
i agree with that .
if not , when will they come down ?
secondly , commissioner , you have said that this is a process of support for the reforms of the member states .
because not just any reform will be sufficient .
so this is national policy .
i have two questions .
mr president , in reply to the first question , i agree .
the standards in question are in fact very new .
these really are issues we should very much like to hear something about in the committee on budgetary control .
what has the commission been doing for the last few years ?
take another example , which also applies to the parliament 's budget .
that will also be decided by this standards committee .
work is of course being done all the time .
the final point of order .
if you need to continue this debate , it must be at another time .
part i
can the commission provide information on other projects in this field ?
this is quite clear .
i would also add that this issue concerns more than just money .
i understand that the council is discussing this at the moment and that your nuclear proposals are based on the wrong legal framework .
how can a case be closed before the committee responsible has either seen or discussed it ?
mr president , i can tell you that there will be specific initiatives .
in order to achieve this objective , the community has taken various initiatives and has recently made proposals .
thank you , commissioner , for your answer .
madam president , i thank the commissioner .
i feel this is something that should not even be up for discussion .
for all these reasons , madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i can vote in favour of this report and would call on you to do the same .
the debate is closed .
commissioner , you have the floor .
that is the position in regard to the issues that have been raised in the questions .
what are they to do ?
madam president , commissioner , there are two areas that give us cause for concern .
so we do not need to go there .
on what basis was that decision to be taken ?
what is done with it ?
as we have been saying about food waste for a long time , a ban is not enough .
i hope you will be able to clear this up in your reply .
there are members of the committee on budgets here now .
how is that possible ?
that is a commission decision .
however , i will do my best to answer such questions as you have raised .
no other political or trade consideration is ever taken into account .
that simply does not happen .
that is a very serious decision to take .
all the time we keep this under review .
that was the appropriate response in those circumstances .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
parliament would like a clear date for action on this .
it is of course a good example of the european parliament 's being able to promote the protection of the environment and of public health in europe .
the debate is closed .
madam president , this is a difficult text .
what is the point of it ?
that is the reason for this directive .
i think that can be called a success .
there were actually countries that did not want to take this approach .
i believe this was also a good step .
that is what it is really about , ladies and gentlemen .
i think we have made a small amount of progress here .
this is an important step for environmental policy .
it has been a very good success for parliament and indeed for the european citizens .
if i am asked to give an example of the way in which the principles of sustainable development can be put into practice , then this directive may well be it .
it is not the case that the industry was united on the matter .
i therefore believe it is a very great success not only for the environment but also for consumer protection .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
side by side , hand in hand .
this is the way it has to be .
this will take place both within the framework of , and by means of the development of , the existing cooperation instruments .
thank you , mr president .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
over the coming year , the commission , together with the presidency , will present the draft accession treaty to parliament .
we will then need parliament to vote in favour of each individual state and of the treaty as a whole .
no national parliament can do that .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
we will be with them as they go down this road .
( applause )
mr president of the european council , let me make a final comment .
this is a task for us all in the future .
( applause )
many issues are currently under discussion .
will this change or not ?
what will happen about members of parliament ?
we will need to discuss this , but the issue is whether there will be an agreement on this point .
i am sure you will do this .
in this respect , too , we need initiatives .
'
we will then get back to talking about the financial framework .
the only thing that makes sense is using enlargement to change what is wrong and , together , doing the right thing .
but we have to say what they are .
what we demand of the commission is that , within the next few months , they tell us what the criteria are to be .
what , in fact , will we have to discuss with turkey over the next two years ?
of course it is not ; instead , we will be discussing fundamental issues of democracy and of how to make it a reality again .
finally , i would like to say something about iraq .
that is something that we in europe never want to see again !
i hope that the european union will take particular initiatives in this area .
thank you to the presidency of the council and to the commission for making this possible .
there is still a lot to be done .
a lot has been done , but there is still a lot to do .
the will was there .
the eu must become more democratic .
we must all show that the new countries are welcome .
madam president , thanks are indeed due for the great job that has been done .
that cannot be right .
we must make a start on this task , therefore .
what does the eu want when it comes to human rights ?
( applause )
is this in fact possible ?
should we not make more efforts in this regard ?
is this what we are called to ?
i think that this is a very good thing .
i wish to close with a few words about turkey .
as you know , two things were made clear as far as turkey is concerned , which in my opinion are very important .
this is a great opportunity for turkey .
i am in full agreement with him on this matter .
this is good for both russia and the eu .
this is only possible if we have a strong commission .
turkey still has a lot to do and has to get back down to work .
what must then happen while negotiations are in progress ?
turkey is a great deal more difficult .
i do not have much time so i will make just two comments .
other problems also play a role in the european parliament 's final assessment that we have to issue for each candidate country .
secondly i would like to make some comments on enlargement .
this was of course not without problems .
i think that this is very important .
i can tell you that there is really very little support for this in the convention .
it is this european parliament that needs more powers .
information , communication and reform continue to be needed .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i would also like to welcome this report and the new directive .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were adopted )
( applause )
we must also make progress at international level .
that is the issue we must address first of all .
( applause )
the time for talking is over .
we must draw up a rule for this .
we must avoid this kind of thing in future .
the one must not take priority over the other .
what is done is done .
it is time we took a fundamental look at our position and our approach to these .
so action is needed at international level .
but we need to do more .
if it does happen again , however , we clearly cannot act as we have done here .
why not ?
as we all know , however , they may not be enough .
this must never happen again .
never again !
what do the conclusions say ?
we do not need to have one debate after another .
we must take action .
things just never change .
naturally it is important to have this discussion , but not now , and not here .
i hope that this will result in a better policy .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , we must indeed do something , and we can go even further than what has already been agreed .
this is of course unacceptable .
should we prevent them ?
of course .
i think this house would do well to agree to that today and tomorrow .
what we want you to tell us is how they are to be implemented .
what we need to do now , however , is to talk more about the future and this is why i would like to address four issues .
to know what has happened ; clearly we all want to know what has happened , but we are not going to achieve this through a parliamentary committee .
they do not exist .
this is what we have to do and we must do it now . that is what we are talking about .
and what does this mean ?
this is what we have to prevent once and for all .
but this means action on an international level as well as on a european union level .
( applause )
and that is what we have to deal with .
i would like to continue with the issue of funds , which the honourable members have mentioned .
we must provide a solution .
( applause )
thank you very much , commissioner .
mr president , a saying is a saying .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on
the things on which agreement has been reached are some of the difficult things .
i share the president-in-office 's view that it is possible for the council to have this directive adopted tomorrow .
certainly more could have been done .
what should we do ?
i would also like to know why the european parliament is never mentioned in the commission 's communication on a community return policy .
nevertheless , we believe that some instruments should be adopted at european level .
but we have not made much progress on that either .
and we know who they are .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i think that what has been said on this subject is very important .
allow me to stress two points .
these issues are real issues .
i will refer firstly to immigration .
what is required ?
a humanitarian eu must be able to do better .
unfortunately , they are .
it is essential .
in any case , it is unacceptable .
but that is not what they are about .
when will it come to something , we asked the commissioner .
so i think we have achieved a great deal .
for this aspect of the matter must be included .
so thank you for your concern .
mr president , i put a specific question to the council and the commission , but i have not been given an answer .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow from 11 am .
mr president , that was precisely what i was trying to say .
there is no doubt as to the aim , however .
i would like to thank the president-in-office for that reply .
however , we still do not have this directive .
this must happen , however .
i wish to thank the council of ministers for its answer .
i also want to express my thanks for the work that has been done in this important area .
is that the council 's view ?
that is all i can say at the present time .
he should therefore tell us what is really going on .
now it is the council 's turn to do something .
research is always in progress , and that is not what this year is for .
what , ladies and gentlemen , is all this about ?
all these demands have been taken into account and included in the final decision .
i see it as a good start that we are able , today , to discuss it during the day .
these must receive support and assistance .
you can therefore see that practical measures are currently being taken .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the commission statement on services of general interest in europe .
there are two main reasons why it has adopted this approach .
this , mr president , is the commission 's statement on this matter .
since then , the commission has done little .
ladies and gentlemen , the conclusion is clear to us .
process can be important , and we must get that right .
i would like to make two points on behalf of my group , the first relating to competition .
these matters call for coordination as we move forward with the development of europe .
the citizens ' needs as regards high quality european public services are currently being expressed in many union countries .
in this connection , the european union has a particular responsibility .
why ?
we must address this issue in the debate on the treaty .
these demands go hand in hand with the need for a europe of social progress , a more democratic europe .
and what is the council doing ?
however , that is part of the job !
what do you mean by ' open ' ?
you discuss these things with others , but not with us .
i will try to make one or two additional points .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
( applause )
of the national public sectors ' .
( applause )
( parliament approved the proposal for a regulation )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
joint motion for a resolution
i wanted to vote against !
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
president .
i would like to make a point of order before you go .
we are also voting in favour of the report because we hope that this aspect will still be given further consideration .
that is why i am voting against this .
we do not .
i have voted in favour of the resolution .
all of this , you will say , has been said many times before , and you would be right .
we need to ask ourselves why they make these comments .
in other areas , things are taking a little longer .
can the commission tell us ?
why is this decision so long in coming ?
for them , the progress we can make here is absolutely essential .
this committee has achieved , i believe , significant progress , but it is not sufficient .
the debate is closed .
consideration is at present being given to the future of these policies .
however , i have to report that this proposal has so far not made much further progress within the council .
i think that we should take into account the important role of the convention in this .
i therefore think that progress should be made in this respect .
i will not add anything regarding agriculture .
this is what the commission should be doing .
that would have been very welcome .
this is a conflict .
i believe that this issue needs to be seen as a whole and not just sector by sector .
i think there is an urgent need for action here .
some of the members have already made proposals and i too would like to make some demands .
the debate is closed .
it is not only i who am concerned .
madam president , one country , two systems .
no !
my second point is that all countries need security legislation .
i put it to you that there is concern .
the debate is closed .
is that not true terrorism , military terrorism , state terrorism ?
no other policy makes sense .
the debate is closed .
this will certainly not be the last time , either .
i only wish that it did . i do not , however , believe that that is the case .
it is , at any rate , a step on the way .
i think that we should seriously ask that question .
the debate is closed .
that is a good point .
but that is not even true .
he will be here later .
it should be raised at another time .
we will , however , take note of your comments .
i believe this is a matter of great importance that should be of interest to parliament .
you are beginning to get into a very political matter .
we are dealing with the agenda .
that is something we must not do .
we will refer that matter to the president .
in this regard , i would like to stress the criteria i adopted as rapporteur .
our institutional system must not favour one system over another .
this report must therefore form the basis of that debate .
our european union is not just a union of states , it is a union of citizens .
what rights should we give to our regions ?
there are other points that have been raised which we think are vital as well .
there should also be opportunities to take things into account during the legislative process and before it .
in many cases these are the local and regional authorities .
'
'
in this regard , the role of the regions is quite simply essential .
could that be possible in an area of freedom , security and justice ?
i should like there to be as few changes as possible to this report .
in practice , this means that all that remains to be decided is what the role of the member states is to be .
the fact is that the regions can of course do that already .
the debate is closed .
the european union is a community of values .
what are the main human rights problems in the european union ?
my question is : will the commission take the lead in this ?
my question is : will the commission take the lead in this as well ?
the commission and parliament itself should in fact also be able to answer this question .
( applause from the right )
i will only comment on certain aspects , mr president , given the time available .
mention has already been made of the asylum issue .
in the light of the situation the world is in , however , this statement is a long way from reality .
the review framework and the review process already exist .
this unacceptable situation must not be allowed to continue .
i welcome the fact that we are able to have a debate on the fundamental rights within the european union .
we need to work towards a common european asylum policy .
we will discuss this matter another time , however .
unfortunately , this has not entirely been the case here .
these rights should be more to the point than many of those included in the report .
data protection and transparency are included .
rights to these must be developed in the treaty .
we must make great demands of ourselves in the eu , now that we are making demands of the candidate countries .
it would be excellent if parliament had a role to play in this .
the fact is they do not want all these rights .
is this a crime against human rights ?
the debate is closed .
what , then , are the crucial points in my report , on which there is such agreement ?
i would like to single out five of them .
we can get down to work .
firstly , in the legislative field .
even if the motion for a resolution in this report is adopted , moreover , it will , of course , in itself have no direct legal effects .
how ?
no answer .
what does the report have to say ?
not a word .
no thank you .
it is for that reason that i hope we can all reach our objective together .
the debate is closed .
we now come to the third proposed directive .
i hope that the commissioner will support all of them .
why have we tabled amendments ?
and we need a high level of safety .
the first , commissioner , is one on which i think we now agree .
i hope that you will support us in this .
who is responsible for what ?
everyone must know how things stand .
we must work on this .
it is an important point , however .
with our reports and your proposals , commissioner , i think that we are taking a significant step forward , for we need to progress towards a european transport market .
the european union should of course direct this policy .
clearly , this will allow progress to be made on many issues .
this has also been mentioned once already today .
they have done some excellent work .
we have tabled an amendment on this for which we hope there is support .
if we do not accept that part , the future will look a great deal better .
the aim of all reforms must be to create a sustainable transport policy in europe .
there is nothing wrong with that .
i can only say that the member states should have done it long ago , and now we are going to do it instead !
other aspects of the transport strategy therefore need to be implemented .
we are responsible to europe 's citizens .
that is why the majority of the proposals are acceptable to the commission , either in their current form or in principle .
in this regard , all these amendments are acceptable to the commission .
i believe that that is the important point .
here also we can accept the majority of the amendments , but not all of them , since some of them are not in line with the principles .
the joint debate is closed .
there are social consequences in relation to safety in the road transport sector , and i believe we must deal with them .
i believe that it was this cooperation that made it possible for a number of important compromise amendments to be adopted in the committee .
what then are the most important points on which a majority of the committee has so far been able to agree ?
less than 1 % , as is the case in certain countries , is not enough .
that is why it is important over time for us to create this european transport area .
the initiative being taken here by the commission and parliament will , i believe , improve safety .
thank you for your attention .
for me , in any case , this is also one of the most important points .
road safety is an important matter .
in the committee debate we were able to improve the proposal , although , in the opinion of our group , the end result is still not acceptable .
the new regulation will not improve road safety either .
what then is to be done ?
on the basis of the first point of view , therefore , no changes are needed , although they are needed on the basis of the second .
my thanks to the rapporteur for his work .
that is something we must do something about .
we think that this is an important safety issue .
this is simply not acceptable .
i will therefore be voting against this regulation .
the last thing the sector needs is more new regulations .
i am talking about road safety . that is the objective of this proposal .
i would like to make a few general comments on the most important issues which have been raised here today , however .
the debate is closed .
)
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before the vote :
ladies and gentlemen , i would welcome your views on this .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
however , it is for the president to decide .
i would therefore firstly move that the vote should not take place .
i refer here to rule 2 of the rules of procedure .
- -
some of these companies come from outside the eu .
i will vote against both these measures .
this is why i voted against it .
why was that ?
this being the case , i cannot support these two reports .
i therefore voted against them .
i therefore voted for the motion .
i feel that this is an area in which , in any case , it is for the member states to decide .
we have therefore voted against this report .
i have voted in favour of this report .
are there any comments ?
this speech does indeed , therefore , concern the agenda .
( the minutes of the previous sitting were approved )
working in this direction is not our only responsibility .
we must give turkey the opportunity to carry out the reforms its country needs .
the next two years will be crucial here .
our second priority is to reform the european economy and promote social cohesion .
we need to implement the economic decisions taken over recent years which we have not done enough to promote .
ladies and gentlemen , we shall be working on six issues .
secondly , we want to create more and better jobs .
we may have to deal with war with iraq over coming months .
we hope not .
we want peace .
iraq has to respect and apply security council resolutions .
( applause )
we hope that there will be agreement here too during our presidency .
( applause )
we have made it our priority for this year .
governments themselves must also help , of course .
any initiative by you in this area would meet with our full support .
mr president-in-office of the council , we are sure that you support that too .
there are two important foreign policy issues , mr president-in-office of the council ; iraq is one of them .
we support your efforts towards a common european position on this issue , on the basis of action by the united nations .
( applause )
firstly , enlargement .
in this regard , i would like to say that it is important that we increase our economic coordination .
i would also address the president of the commission .
that is something we would do very well .
there must be no war with iraq .
i do not , therefore , understand this strategy .
we must tell the security council this .
thank you mr president .
and the third point has to do with social issues .
i shall stop the list there , mr president .
do you share the view that a common market in defence needs to be created ?
my second question has to do with enlargement , and , in particular , with your strategy in relation to turkey .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , mr president of the commission , it is only right that much should have been said about iraq , which is very much a live issue .
the european union needs to have a view and an opinion about this new world .
so do programmes .
the european union is already taking on ten new members .
an excellent move .
obviously , the european union cannot deal with this as an internal problem .
as far as defence and immigration policy are concerned , i agree .
cooperation is not enough .
i wish you every success .
may i wish you every success .
we do not know what is going to happen in iraq .
i believe that this is the way to go .
no : these are the basis of all the measures we will take this year .
part i
president .
that is not possible .
mr president , commissioner , i wish to add something to what has just been said .
there are three questions i would like to put to you .
it is difficult to say what is most important .
in cases like this almost everything is important .
this is extremely high on the agenda .
commissioner , thank you for your response .
this will be decided by the european council at the appropriate time .
thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
it is a very , very serious matter .
i have two points to make to the president .
only in this case .
i can then reply in that context .
and
thank you for your reply , commissioner .
first of all , i should like to refer to the reply that the president will give today .
we know that much has happened .
i have two points .
that is an ' either / or ' approach .
i just wanted to point that out .
i should like to make two points .
i understand , however , the point made by the member .
there are two main reference markets : the united states and europe .
in particular i should like to thank the rapporteur for his important report .
all these concerns need to be taken into account , and the rapporteur referred to a number of them .
we cannot seriously accept this .
we support the rapporteur on three essential points .
the european commission has asked us to speak on this matter .
on the other hand , these activities have an increasing return .
it is for these two reasons that , based on experience , a public interest regulation is vital .
the debate is closed .
the commission will issue a new communication on measures which need to be taken during the current year on the basis of this experience and the work i referred to earlier .
the solution to this problem must be implemented quickly since it concerns all the member states .
this will allow a balance between the three objectives .
the second is that equal access to health services is a fundamental right and must remain one .
that applies in the case of economic policy and employment policy .
mr president , i welcome the opportunity for debate on this report , on what is an important issue for all our countries .
that is a welcome move .
certainly not if europe would have to be given new powers on such a basis .
in europe we all have the same problem .
why ?
why ?
it is certainly the view of my group that such services should not be included .
let me make another comment .
i am very pleased about that .
i think it is a great thing that the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy has adopted this amendment .
i hope that we will do the same when we vote tomorrow .
action is needed , on the part of all of and us at every political level .
the debate is closed .
first , the need to improve internal security .
the minister has already referred to our concern about this .
it is far from that .
what is the situation today ?
we look forward with confidence to a very successful and very effective six months .
it is not so today .
this must not be allowed to continue .
this must not be allowed to happen .
i would like to speak about both at the same time .
the reality is , however , rather different .
this must stop .
a certain amount has been done about this .
there is no mention of women and their human rights .
women 's rights and legal position are among these things .
others are international law and human rights .
what has become of their rights ?
what legal system do they come under ?
the united states does not respect international law - of that we are well aware - but nor does it respect its own law .
why is it so difficult to bring about change ?
in due course these people must go home .
the international community should take note of this .
much still needs to be done .
let us take a look into the future .
well done !
all this is true .
we are only a short way down the line and we still have a great deal to do over a very long period of time .
they do have a difficult job .
so we are aware of these concerns .
that was one of the points on which this house made proposals at first and second reading .
we did .
let me point out , however , that many other important aspects are included .
all those aspects are clearly of benefit to the consumer .
that is precisely what management needs , and that is why this is the right way to go .
ladies and gentlemen , i have no need of three minutes .
the second major result concerned ourselves as consumers .
you are needed .
finally , i will end by saying that this third reading is a good example of the quality of the parliamentary work that has been done under the responsibility of our rapporteur .
there is no such ban , however .
in future we will think of european legislation .
this is something we must do together .
i would rather not hear anything further said on this subject in this house .
thank you for the debate , and i hope that the vote , which is about to take place , will go well .
thank you , rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
joint motion for a resolution
could my colleagues help me here ?
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i agree with you entirely .
why did i vote for the report ?
that is why i voted against this report .
we therefore voted against .
we think the report is very good and are therefore voting in favour of it .
for example :
1 .
2 .
i have voted against the report .
it is the most important means of communication between people .
it is the first step .
but why ?
naturally , we voted against this report .
in order to guarantee security within the eu , in particular following enlargement , we need to :
which at the end of the day is the only effective solution .
it is important that this should continue to be the case .
i was pleased that my amendments were accepted by the rapporteur as well as the full house today .
the questions are financial .
at the end of the day , this report is based on a model such as this .
we support the resolution but wish to point out that it makes no mention of women or their human rights .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
with regard to this agreement , i would like to comment on certain issues which have been raised during the debate in committee .
within this context , the issue of respect for human rights and democratic principles is essential to this parliament .
social and cultural cooperation is also central to the agreement , in terms of rights of workers , and social dialogue .
secondly we must ask : which policies ?
the most important thing is for it to have instruments in order to make real progress in the field of rights , democracy and freedom .
in the long term , they promote democracy and development - political , economic and social .
how does the council view that ?
unfortunately that is still in doubt .
as you know , a great many measures and a great many decisions have been taken .
mr president , i will try to live up to that request .
we turn now from one end of europe , as it were , to another .
there is still a lot of work to be done .
it has yet to see the light of day .
i hope i am wrong .
our group is pleased with the resolution the political groups have together agreed upon here .
mr president , commissioner , there are a number of points i would very much like to deal with .
now it is a question of what the role of the european union is .
why is that ?
there is greater need for the project at present than ever before .
that is something we must avoid come what may .
it is an economic area that must be developed .
in our relations with russia , we must continue to demand greater democracy .
as they deal with the same subject , questions no 1 and 2 will be taken together .
we need the council to act more quickly .
it is not my place to tell the european parliament whether or not it should set up a committee .
additional measures therefore need to be adopted .
it will nevertheless have to make a decision about this .
does he support it or not ?
i would like a clear answer on this point .
mr president , thank you very much for your kind words .
thank you for your reply .
my question to you is this :
nor is the council in a position to express an opinion on the monitoring system set up under the european convention on human rights .
thank you .
the minister is right .
so what are these problems and where do we think we can help ?
subject : date for the accession of new member states
but we heard it yesterday and we heard it again today .
what has to be done ?
a clear common position has to be adopted on iraq !
and what is he going to do with these four members ?
of course they too have a responsibility , but what will the four from the european union do ?
is this our peace effort ?
this is not in fact a question .
you made a very long statement .
that is a commitment for everyone .
why ?
i would simply like to say that i share them .
i would just like to make two specific comments .
my second comment concerns the environment .
there is a great deal to be done .
my last comment concerns relations with the european union .
that is not all .
my second point is the subject of the amendments which i hope will be adopted by parliament .
there are , however , still many countries that are , and will be , outside the eu 's internal market .
it is our task to demand that it does so .
there are certainly no opportunities for local economic development .
we will support you in this approach .
this too must play a part in today 's debate .
however , what is also important is to see how stability can be achieved in these countries .
these states ' accession to the eu will open up many investment opportunities , which will not be available to other states .
that is also something for which there is certainly a need .
there is really something for the bank to do in this connection .
no .
the answer is no .
the debate is closed .
we shall see .
what can be done in the short term ?
consumers and the industry as a whole stand to benefit .
i do not think that this is a good idea .
but it will not .
furthermore , consumers benefit from food safety and transparency , both of which are particularly important .
it must always be possible to guarantee food safety .
there can be no question that all future development in the sector must be on a sustainable basis .
i do not think so .
i believe that research in this area is particularly important .
another objective - one which parliament is particularly concerned with - is food safety , environmental impact and animal health .
we have obviously achieved this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
nor is it a development bank coming under the world bank group .
like the rapporteur , i think we have to support the bank .
we need to look at our position as regards developing countries .
we cannot say one thing , and then do another .
we need only think of the reform of the common fisheries policy .
the debate is closed .
madam president , i want to thank the commission for its statement .
i look forward very much to your response .
the debate is closed .
the question is whether this is enough .
it is clear that we cannot continue to do things as they have been done so far .
the debate is closed .
why ?
why ?
for human rights and democracy .
the debate is closed .
i have asked the commission and the council about this .
first , the conditions for their return must be put in place .
another very important matter is the considerable humanitarian aid provided by the european union .
if you will allow me , i would now like to deal with the central issue of the urgent resolution under consideration .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we have reached the end of the agenda .
i should like to know if there is a new practice in parliament .
colleagues , i think you have made your point .
( applause from the right )
( applause )
i will begin with the first point : the situation in iraq .
( applause )
as you are aware , yesterday the president of the united states made an important speech .
( applause )
it is difficult .
( applause )
how can we deal with these problems ?
i think the whole of the european parliament would believe that it was right to try to do that .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
what i ask , ladies and gentlemen , is that we should respect each other 's points of view .
that must be our concern ; it is that for which we must work , and the united nations is the framework within which we must do it .
that is why we have to keep up the pressure !
( applause )
why ?
i believe that that should be the basis for the european course of action .
why did he not do so before ?
do we have measures to deal with it ?
has the un considered this ?
this is an important issue , as is the economic situation , and not just that of europe .
he is a war criminal and he must be brought before the international criminal court .
( applause )
)
( applause )
we must not let them down !
( applause )
what did we do ?
there is a problem , however .
obviously not !
of course not !
that is why we must step back .
so we have time .
let us change the agenda and our priorities .
let us change the agenda .
( applause )
at the same time , it is very clear that the eu is not united .
we also have another task .
i believe that the way forward is through democracy , development and cooperation .
later on , however , after 20 days , will there be a different strategy ?
what will europe propose ?
that is his opinion !
what are the consequences ?
i hope that we will vote tomorrow on a joint resolution tabled by several political groups , as well as on a number of amendments .
we also have our share of responsibility , however .
so much for democracy .
there are many other proposals .
so let her tell us what they are !
( applause )
and what are we doing about it ?
we need to answer a number of questions about crisis management .
the european parliament will perhaps adopt a common resolution tomorrow on iraq , a resolution which i support .
only the security council can make decisions on this .
finally , i know that time is up but i wish to make two short points .
thank you .
firstly , there can be no doubt that this is a difficult debate .
we are talking about such serious issues as war and peace .
i say this within the context of the european union .
there was pressure , very significant pressure from many countries , the majority of countries of the european union .
we are therefore working in the right direction .
let us hope that it is for good .
all further action must take place within the framework of the un .
and what are we doing ?
no !
i entirely agree with the motion for a resolution .
here too , the views of the european parliament on the countries which we need to support will be vital .
i found a number of positive things in what the commissioner said , and i hope that we can make them a reality .
i do not think so .
i understand that that does in fact happen .
i would like to refer to three in particular .
that would not be in the nature of the european union .
it would be extremely good if this really were the case .
this is not a new problem we are discussing .
this resolution is an important step forward in favour of international law and the rule of law .
how can this be so ?
the major problem i have in mind is that of a system of justice .
that is the important thing about the united nations report .
i think that we have a real responsibility in this respect .
it is simply not acceptable that this is still going on .
i would like to start by discussing the implementation of reforms .
these are just some of the essential points .
we must be able to approach the commission on these issues .
in the long term , that is just not on .
in the long term , our citizens will not stand for it .
this is something on which we have to work together .
the debate is closed .
i think that something needs to be done about this .
that is being left to the member states .
let me , though , make one thing clear .
on this , i cannot do other than agree with him .
this is not acceptable .
something is wrong here .
it is not working .
this is not right .
the debate is closed .
i therefore congratulate the commissioner for the environment .
the debate is closed .
it says that parliament adopted one amendment at first reading .
this is not true .
madam president , i am last but not least and i hope i shall not take three minutes .
the debate is closed .
in some of these countries or regions , the food crisis is not a general crisis .
free trade is not fair trade .
there is almost no aspect of the problem that it does not discuss .
it would be better if this control was carried out in a national context rather than by international institutions .
ladies and gentlemen , food aid to areas in crisis is too little in itself for a sustainable strategy .
the help of the eu is very important in this regard .
we must therefore ask how we trade .
who will take responsibility for it ?
i do not refer simply to food aid .
we can do far more about this than we are actually doing at the moment .
we protect our own agricultural community in europe at the cost of other countries .
so we must look at the common agricultural policy .
we can do more then we are doing at the moment .
that must not be .
are we going to support him ?
of course we must improve market access for agricultural products from the developing countries .
we all have a responsibility .
they do not get services as such .
this makes sense .
unfortunately , i never even received an answer .
thank you , commissioner .
the other aspect is the eu 's contribution to the global health fund which has recently been set up .
however , there are one or two amendments that cause some difficulties .
we do not want to give with one hand and take away with the other .
this is precisely what the development council states : any funding should be additional .
on this point , the committee on development and cooperation has done a good job .
we must pay the necessary attention to this as well .
i support this report , mr president , and i hope that it will be adopted at first reading .
we carry some responsibility for that .
the debate is closed .
i vote against .
we will make a note of that .
'
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
joint motion for a resolution
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
before the vote on paragraph 4 :
two of the provisions , however , are not acceptable as they stand .
'
' i said to myself .
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
three things are needed to change the situation , as the report makes clear .
i support the rapporteur and his efforts to increase new funding .
this is a significant step forward .
i must , nevertheless , make some specific comments .
they will need time for that .
we say : ' freedom for iraq !
we want to talk .
- ' enough is enough ' .
are there any comments ?
may i ask for the rules of procedure to be applied in this case ?
if , as a result , an amendment needs to be made to that effect , let us do that .
the following change has been proposed :
i ask you to put a stop to this practice .
( parliament agreed to the request )
i hope he will be able to come .
now , mr president , i wish to mention something that has happened here .
no , i will not do that .
i am not prepared to deal with the matter in those terms .
' )
that is the end of the matter as far as i am concerned .
we are very pleased to see you here .
thank you for coming .
these two events , however , have many things in common .
in this regard , our point of view in the commission is clear .
we need both .
it is taking a while to establish for at least two reasons .
europe has a vital interest in this issue .
open up your markets ? trade means work .
trade is important , of course .
a second issue is the whole set of problems in connection with the environment .
this is an area in which we could do very much more .
we still need to be equal to the questions raised by this movement in relation to the european union .
the european union is the best example of this .
there is certainly no way back .
as the european union , we have an important part to play in this debate .
it is therefore in the interest of companies too to be involved in the implementation of human and fundamental rights .
the main question remains , however : how will we in the european union , in the commission , receive these proposals ?
this could be our response , with a certain number of conditions .
i shall now speak on a number of more specific points .
we would refer you to the convention , which once again must rule on this point .
we will come back to them in the debate that is to follow .
your committee on industry , external trade , research and energy may take them up under the conditions of our institutional agreement .
the union 's position remains the same .
we must make progress .
we had been working on this issue for almost a year .
i am naturally aware of the negotiations in which the commissioner has been involved .
so : this far and no further .
that is my first point .
what do we do then ?
the next item is the commission statement on the wto agricultural trade negotiations .
clearly , this is vital to the negotiations in question .
the european union certainly has a world responsibility in terms of negotiations on agriculture .
for us the most important thing is that we have found that the european people do not fully support european agricultural policy at this moment .
clearly this must change , so we must change european agricultural policy .
and this is not always the case .
but let us call it as it is .
we are talking about a social model for europe .
the same will happen with the wto agreement , for three basic reasons .
mr president , commissioner , what i actually would like to do is to address just a few points , as my colleagues have already had a lot to say .
perhaps you could say something about this .
now for the question of whether we are going too far .
the situation is therefore serious and urgent .
this was the purpose of the amendments adopted by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
that is not acceptable .
this directive is a step in the right direction .
this is our request .
this is a welcome proposal .
this is either about the free movement of all of our citizens or it is not .
we must turn freedom of movement into a reality within the eu .
madam president , i would like to ask the commissioner a question .
his answer does not address that issue .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this is very much a step forward .
i hope that this debate and its impact on the council will allow us to move forward .
for my part , i welcome the commission 's proposal .
madam president , this is just an opinion report .
madam president , i thank the rapporteur .
- but that cannot be the solution !
madam president , i would like to thank the commissioner and the rapporteur for her report .
it is a major step towards a common european immigration policy .
we have to move the debate forward .
it is an important and necessary report .
it can be seen where all that would lead us if this directive were to be adopted .
this is the reason why immigration is so necessary .
on that we all agree .
we agree on that as well .
thus far , we are all of one mind .
it is a serious problem in a small country such as my own .
we have to accept that member states know their own situation best .
i have never said that there is a right to immigration .
there is no right to immigration .
immigration is only a possibility .
our proposal states that very clearly .
that is a fundamental principle in our proposal .
the debate is closed .
we congratulate the rapporteur .
this is the subject of the report we are discussing today , for which i am rapporteur .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and support .
the debate is closed .
this is of course unacceptable .
on that , commissioner , i agree with you entirely .
let us hope that some progress is made soon .
there could be no peace under these conditions .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
before the vote :
this is , then , a question for the commission .
the commission presented a first report two years ago in 2001 .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before the vote on amendment no 5 :
before the vote on amendment no 3 :
that does not help .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
' ' i ?
and i did , in fact , vote against the motion .
'
if we turn people away we must have a good reason for doing so .
when and where will they stop ?
the problem we now have is not with the treaty .
money is needed if that is to be done , but money is not the most important thing .
i am not sure .
the debate is closed .
what should our strategy for transport be ?
this is not the case .
now the governments must have their say .
if it has to be , then let it be like this .
they were an instrument .
that may well be so .
we want all those things , too .
what is this about ?
that is not acceptable ; you simply must see that .
that is no longer acceptable , and i want to make that clear here and now .
we will make no progress at all !
we do not have many months .
the debate is closed .
it should therefore also be discussed by this parliament .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the subject for debate here is not simply a report on the transport of the future .
now we must act .
where , in fact , does the commission stand ?
i think this is something we have to respect .
the debate is closed .
part i
thank you , commissioner , for your extremely clear response to this question .
since then the commission has not presented any specific proposals within the framework of this programme .
let me turn to the honourable member 's important question .
thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
i would thank the commissioner for that answer .
that is my comment and that is the comment included in our report .
what can we do ?
in the commission , we already help , support and fund various actions in this field .
we are trying to achieve better coordination of the various instruments available to us .
we must therefore change this .
is development the objective of these negotiations ?
they did not lead to an agreement .
if that were not the case , i would have to decide whether or not to take it further .
no , of course not .
this is not a change .
the following conclusions are very important in this respect .
it simply does not make sense .
you say that the directive is based upon all available information .
the reason for its review is your directive .
i am open to any information they may have to give me .
i should like to hear the commissioner 's view on it .
commissioner , what measures could we take to encourage the application of this directive ?
i would very much like some measure to be taken in this regard .
i believe that it is very important to tell the minister about a very specific instrument that he can use before the implementation of the legislation .
the scope for growth in this sector is still very great .
this is not the way to go and unfortunately we do not have enough of that guarantee .
i cannot agree with that at all .
within it , the environment is in our view the most important aspect .
with some good and some not so good points .
i think all the political groups will more or less vote the same way tomorrow on a number of points which are vital to the future of transport in the european union .
as it is we have too few resources here .
ladies and gentlemen , let us not have yet another european transport fund !
i should like to stress two points today .
i also agree , of course , with his concern for safety and social requirements .
the commission must move in this area .
mr president , we must back a transport system in europe that makes high demands in terms of the environment and safety .
that is important .
we must improve road safety in the eu .
i hope that it will be in place soon .
mr president , commissioner , i think there are a few areas in which the european union should make a commitment .
that is why the union needs resources .
it needs money .
naturally , that is out of date today .
where transport is concerned , the key question is always what the transport service costs .
i will move on to the issues in the report .
that is one of our group 's concerns .
i have no doubt that better public transport has a vital part to play in this transport strategy .
here , we are talking about balance and the need to get it right .
we also have the environmental impact on our air quality .
this programme established the single european area of research .
however , i would like to make a few comments with regard to the important points which have been raised here and in the report .
at the end of the day , they are the same idea .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports tabled by the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy
and the first political question of course is why are we not doing the same in europe ?
not before time , because we all know that security is a major concern .
we therefore need to increase coordination of all these decisions .
its development will bring with it significant economic , political and cultural opportunities .
it will create work and opportunities , but problems too .
that is very important .
thank you commissioner .
i too hope that the debate will take place during the day next time .
we must also do all we can at european level to support this sector .
all of this is , as you know , also provided for in the commission 's paper .
the old saying is true here that not every problem in europe is a problem for europe .
what is important about this proposal ?
first of all , it is important that progress be made .
i hope this will be supported .
no doubt we will be able to return to this at a later stage .
in my opinion we as a parliament must fight hard for the rights of the citizens .
this has happened too little to date .
that is democracy .
this progress does also provide opportunities for development .
who will be able to offer these services ?
this comes at a very important time .
for two reasons .
nothing .
nothing .
what do we need ?
i will focus on just two of the reports under discussion today .
we must guarantee that the conditions for access to this information are the same throughout europe .
thank you commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
again in the tax sector , we are still trying to reach political agreement on an energy tax .
as i am sure you know , the council has yet to reach political agreement here .
another major issue is employment and social cohesion .
the reform of the european employment strategy is a very important issue for the presidency .
in addition , we need to review the european employment strategy .
( applause )
we need it .
however , which region in the world does not have problems ?
so what do we see ?
however , if war were necessary , we would all have to take another look .
mr president , i congratulate the president-in-office on his speech and wish him well with his agenda .
so how much progress have we made , one year on ?
the answer is no .
let us look at employment : there are too few new jobs .
who is discussing energy tax reforms ?
and so on , and so on .
thank you , mr president , even though there is not very much to say thank you for .
we need to look at this clearly .
that is what we must do .
where is the framework directive for services of general interest ?
i think that there are two reasons for this .
it does not .
what , however , can we do about it now ?
that is one example that i would like to give .
there is a great deal of talk about employment effects .
the commission itself did not look into that .
things often do not turn out as one would think .
i think that that is very important .
i should like to put one question to the presidency , however .
can an end not be put to this ?
environment , social aspects and economy are each of equal importance .
this is a crisis across europe .
that is what i , in any case , believe .
in conclusion , i want to say something about sustainable development .
sustainable development has to do with the environment too , however .
that is quite right .
in which areas do we want to be number one and by what date ?
this question demands an answer , and soon .
you are in a position to do this , and you can get it done .
there is a second aspect that seems to me to be of great importance .
these people are the future of europe , and we force them into unemployment .
what will you do about the new legislation on environmental responsibility ?
i think an answer is required .
if not now , then during the discussions at summit level .
in all events , a clear answer is required .
if sustainable development is to be possible , each country must do more than it is currently doing , and together we must do more than we are currently doing .
i hope that now , some action will be the result .
that was very difficult .
there is not more new europe than old europe .
there is quite simply no europe at all .
the member states need to make greater efforts for reform , that is true , but the union needs to support them and not make their task more difficult .
the first is confidence , the second is action and the third is balance , the european model .
and that is very , very important .
of course , we still have a great deal to do in this direction .
thank you , mr president-in-office of the council .
is that still the case , or do you want to say something after all , mr president ?
it is clear that this is not the best of times , in both political and economic terms .
why ?
because it had the most points .
this is why i voted for the report .
this is why i have voted in favour of the report .
i therefore voted against the report .
the european parliament 's resolution is an acceptable contribution in this direction .
in other words , the commission is trying to force our hand .
mr president , i have voted in favour of this report .
increased cooperation on road safety between the eu member states is very important .
we are not in favour of a european transport fund .
there is a lot of money in already existing funds that is not used to the full .
however , we need to be aware of the kind of policy we are talking about .
) .
these are my reasons for voting in favour of the report .
road safety is a very important responsibility .
for all ?
i therefore voted against it .
i refer to the common foreign policy and defence policy .
my reply is that i do not know if we can , but that we must try , we must find a way .
let me now turn to the humanitarian aspects of the crisis .
this is a most serious situation .
if this parliament is to be relevant , it has to allow more time for all points of view to be expressed .
it will not be our last .
( applause )
there are also , of course , things that we demand of our american partners .
( applause )
that is why we have to act within the framework of the community .
all the things we are doing now have to be done on a community basis .
i hope that we will also achieve a result on this issue .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
let us keep it there .
( applause )
mr president-in-office of the council , i think it would be a very good thing if we really could find a common position on the points you have set out .
i would like to take a close look at these four points .
one of those problems is that with the candidate countries .
( applause )
competition does not help in these circumstances .
rather , cooperation is required .
it is he , and he only , that can prevent war .
it is the security council that must then decide what is to happen .
the un needs our support at this difficult time .
as we all know , the majority of european public opinion is united against war .
( applause )
( applause )
it is not clear .
we too have a responsibility , namely to work out how much cooperation is required here and now in order to prevent a war .
we in europe must start by using every means other than military force .
what does that mean in terms of iraq ?
we do not !
it may be , but europe must stand united , the international community must stand united .
we should have a common foreign and security policy - not a single policy but a common policy .
that much is very clear .
i do not believe that any of us want war .
they are all serious questions .
mr president , i have nothing much to add to what i said at the start of the debate .
the debate is closed .
we very much support that .
the council has not yet been asked to decide on the specific issue raised in the question .
i do not see that such is the case .
firstly , i agree with both the council and the commission that it is fair to say that we have made a lot of progress in the field of cooperation on criminal matters .
i believe that this is really positive .
i believe that the citizens expect us to deal with this issue from a community point of view .
i do not understand what is going on here .
i do not understand .
we need to get real ; now is the time to act .
if you , the council , really want to mean something to the citizens of europe , vote for this directive .
what europe needs , therefore , is a new immigration policy .
i should like to draw your attention to work which is currently in progress .
very good !
so what is the situation today ?
what does the council do ?
such is the reality of the situation today .
that is wrong .
i am now making them an offer , and this is the first time - but not , i hope , the last - that they will receive such an offer in this form .
such , though , is not the case .
that was 20 years ago tomorrow .
in other words , there can be no security without freedom and justice .
decisions need to be taken , especially in areas such as data protection .
what i mean is we have a certain amount of experience here .
the commission presented the proposal on the return action plan .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i just wish to make a point of order .
that was the first aspect .
it is here that the european union could , by its actions , give a very good example .
this would not be the first such action .
after all , a great deal of money is involved and this is , above all , very much a live issue .
this is extremely serious .
mr president , i refer to the motion for a resolution .
this resolution is not really about any of these things .
thank you , mr president .
the debate is closed .
i believe that we all have to make a move , not just parliament .
the council has a responsibility to take on here .
we therefore give the report our full support and hope that the member states will be able to get down to work as soon as possible .
my thanks again to all those who have given their assistance .
monitoring is actually the key word in this proposal .
moreover , it was a safety policy .
why ?
tomorrow this parliament will vote on the report and then we will have to continue working in order to be able to achieve at some point a common position which can be accepted by this house .
the debate is closed .
it was necessary to try to get this regulation adopted at first reading .
mr president , we too , the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities , have been able to discuss this regulation .
mr president , we are discussing an important matter .
my first point is of a financial nature .
taking all those things together , this means that many programmes cannot be implemented .
even more important : does the council agree with this proposal ?
this debate , and i would like to thank our rapporteur for her work on the subject , has to remain serious .
we will make every effort to get these financial resources increased in the future and to see that they are used well .
this is a key aspect of the text on which we will vote .
is the commission aware of these positive results ?
i know there is a problem with the budget aspects of this report , but i hope that the amendments tabled are acceptable so that this report can have a clear majority in favour at first reading .
there is nothing this report can do to propose a change in this legal position .
the reality is that if we do not receive a positive vote tomorrow , there will be no budget line .
( applause from the left )
and i would hope , commissioner , that you also share this approach .
that is why i will support this vote and call on others to do so .
it is for each individual to decide .
( applause from the left )
however , i do not see this as something that should lead to a second reading .
this is the purpose of all this .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
it is clear that will be a difficult measure , but it is a vital one .
but that is not enough .
the commission will have the support of my committee , and i am sure the whole of the parliament , in meeting the objectives it has set out .
that said , however , there is still a long way to go .
it is also about the free movement of workers , the free movement of labour .
rather , they would receive the comment ' could do better ' .
in fact , they could do much better .
nothing has happened .
the debate is closed .
decision on urgent procedure
( the decision was made not to apply urgent procedure . )
i welcome this report .
these are proposals that we cannot under any circumstances support .
an assessment will be carried out in due course .
in the real world , drugs have always been a fact of life . ' and that is the way things are .
that is not to say , however , that there is nothing wrong with other drugs .
this approach does most to benefit health .
this paper is an excellent step forward .
young people and children in my country currently do not know where they stand .
this is the way we should be going .
because if we are not in a position to share of our own free will now , then we will certainly have to do so in the future .
but the use of these drugs is on the increase .
the debate is closed .
that is why i accept all three amendments which have been tabled to this report .
how did we get to this stage ?
finally , there must be responsible research .
this issue will not go away .
that is crucial .
we want to guarantee that .
why ?
i would like to make one final point .
and what for ?
the debate is closed .
however , the house has voted and we cannot go back on that vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the necessary money would be taken from the existing budget .
that is a good thing !
that is why i also voted in favour of the report .
i have therefore voted in favour of this proposal .
it is , however , going too far for europe to say that women should protect themselves .
it would be much better for member states to issue their own legislation in this regard .
is this europe 's business ?
i have therefore voted against the resolution .
it could not have been put any better .
i will not say any more , mr president , in order to allow my colleagues to speak .
you of course referred to existing legislation that needs to be applied .
who is responsible ?
who should pay ?
i would ask that this be considered in the debate on the social europe within the convention .
let us think about that .
how do you expect that to work ?
and in my opinion , that comes under the convention .
this debate is , therefore indeed about the social future , but also about the economic future of europe .
we entirely support it .
we have funds in europe that we can work with .
finally i would like to draw your attention to the european social funds .
we all know that .
that is indeed the case .
i shall now deal with some of the issues you raised .
i should like to make a few points on that .
thank you , commissioner .
perhaps the european union could help them do just that .
the concerns that we have in this motion for a resolution need to be tabled .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
the debate is closed .
why , one might ask , are we doing so now ?
i call upon members to support the resolution without amendment .
mr president , there will never be a european foreign policy as long as member states continue to follow their own agenda .
not even a convention will help bring one about .
it is not , at the moment , the only one .
the debate is closed .
this is not the issue .
the issue is where and how the european union has a legal right to act .
)
if the situation were to change , it would clearly also change as far as we are concerned .
what is more , according to our information , the security council vote will , in any case , take place before we have had time to act in this regard .
thank you , mr president .
i am not clear as to who is responsible here , however .
the only issue concerns when it should be voted .
( the order of business was thus established )
i think that you must do something about this .
( applause from the right )
we will follow that up for you .
i take note of that .
what does concern me is the political aspect .
i take note of your point .
i shall now come to the negotiations themselves .
what are our objectives ?
the european union will be the first member of the world trade organisation to take this step .
first of all , energy services .
another aspect is education .
let us take as an example an area which concerns us and you particularly , the area of education .
i would , however , like to say one more thing .
we must provide access to the services markets .
not only in our own interest but also in the interest of developing countries .
we must also provide our own training .
it is of course a good thing that we are doing more to include the environment in this .
i therefore think that it should also benefit developing countries .
i should like to ask the commissioner what the situation is in this regard .
what does he mean by this , and what can we expect in this regard ?
my group would like to focus on that point .
that is my first question .
finally , development .
i believe we must not put that kind of pressure on the developing countries .
these negotiations are certainly more than crucial for europe .
when will there be an action strategy for the european union ?
thank you very much for the report you have put before us today .
we do not yet have an internal market for services .
far from it !
that is what we want to encourage .
let us be positive about it .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , the service sector is far and away the most important sector in the european economy .
the right to culture is a fundamental human right .
i therefore call for this process to be brought to an end as soon as possible .
such decisions , of course , are party political in nature .
we support the international instrument , but how much progress has been made on it ?
madam president , we should take the position that we do not expect of developing countries what we are not prepared to do ourselves .
let us be very clear on this issue . the whole house has heard an account of the principles on which the commission 's approach to these negotiations is based .
not a single one !
no such commitment has been given by any country .
they have not said that up to now .
i know this is an issue of great concern to the rapporteur and other members and furthermore i believe that progress must be made on it .
i would ask you that we may work as hard as possible to find it as soon as possible .
we have nothing against these people .
let me say quite clearly that this is , in our view , unacceptable .
we believe this to be wrong .
they therefore have nothing to do with this directive .
thank you , mr president .
i want to know the impact of this on other sectors .
there seems to be a major problem , and i would like to know if there really is , as we have not yet come to the end of the road .
i would like to say something about two matters .
that means a return to the old situation .
for this reason we voted against the measure at first reading .
thank you , mr president .
why ?
so why did we not vote it out ?
i will continue to fight against this directive , i will vote against it tomorrow and i will continue to do so .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
that is all we need .
it is therefore being left up to the member states to decide whether or not to do this .
if this is the case then i will vote in favour .
many people want to achieve this , but extremely few are working towards doing so .
that is something i hope parliament will do .
but when there is competition things work better .
absolutely nothing , ladies and gentlemen .
and that is what we are doing , ladies and gentlemen .
i believe we have to consider what we are doing .
still more can be done and we are going to do it .
that is simply the european model .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the commission can accept all the amendments proposed , although i would like to comment on amendment no 2 a little later .
finally , i will mention amendment no 2 .
why ?
this could play a part in the creation of new jobs in rural areas .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
and when these measures are taken in this way , the sector itself will accept them better .
we can already feel the effects .
clearly , it is the fishing effort that matters .
their policy - the policy of the member states - is also in need of reform .
we , the eu , are a community based on solidarity and we have to help .
but how ?
mr president , the fisheries industry in crisis - we have heard it all before .
but this time it is extremely serious .
but what is the future to be ?
mr president , i would like to ask a question .
is this something that the commission might also consider ?
thank you very much , commissioner , for this additional answer .
at the end of this debate , i have received a proposal for a resolution on behalf of the committee on fisheries .
we will do that .
the debate on the state of the union is an established item on our agenda .
let me start with enlargement today .
the iraq crisis and the state of international relations mean we can put it off no longer .
absolutely not .
giving in is absolutely out of the question .
the questions before us , which we have to answer , are both difficult and crucial .
what kind of europe do we want ?
indeed , next year , our efforts will focus on enlargement , growth and internal and external security .
we have asked for a report .
in this context there is one specific question i would like to ask the president of the commission .
while talking about the commission , mr president , you mentioned the convention .
concerning sustainable growth , it makes sense to have better integration of environmental concerns .
finally , i come to my group 's priorities during the budgetary process .
we would like to see that document .
we would like to see that document as soon as possible .
i hope that at the end of the process our parliament will be able to reach the right conclusions in the interests of our citizens .
let me now deal with stability in and around europe .
think of public transport , which could also do more for the environment .
let me give you an example .
that , mr president , is why , with all the respect that is due to you and that i have for you , i would ask you to review your document .
indeed , we have little time left in this legislative period .
if not , this is another part that must be included in the budgetary procedure .
i should now like to turn to a point of an entirely different order .
in the view of my group , that is unacceptable .
that , however , is the only part of this debate with which i agree .
further discussions will be needed on this subject .
we shall have to look into this .
what can be done better at european level than in the individual member states ?
what can we do to improve nuclear safety in the new member states ?
even if , as a european union , we want to play a greater role in foreign affairs , this will have to be set down in appropriate proposals on the budget .
it is with specific reference to enlargement that i want to draw attention today to the increasing cost of internal security in the european union of the future .
i heard what the commissioner said earlier .
i welcome that .
we want enlargement .
the means are available to us to do something about this .
that is something we cannot accept .
now for the final point that i want to address .
we want all policies to be considered from the point of view of what these changes will mean in the future ?
this working group is about to start work .
so the crucial question is what democratic control there will be when we get a common defence policy .
in this context , the first is support for the social dialogue .
they need our help with that , help that we can - and should - provide by means of european union funds .
the debate is closed .
let me make it absolutely clear that i am not speaking as a british labour member and , therefore , i cannot say those things .
that is quite clear .
thank you for your attention .
this cannot be allowed to continue .
the two matters must go hand in hand .
this will provide greater control over the use of funds .
( applause )
we can all , therefore , understand its importance .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
i do not see the need to vote on the others .
mr president , i do not agree with the rapporteur .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
naturally , i fully support this report .
i am very pleased that you are now president of parliament , but i should just like to talk about this directive .
we supported and still support their action .
unfortunately , the procedure does not give us any scope to prevent this at eu level .
we know how difficult it is to create all the conditions necessary to ensure stability and we must work to ensure sustainable growth .
jobs call for the right financial framework conditions .
one cannot help but see that if a country has very high unemployment and this unemployment does not go down , something is not right .
this is especially the case if one part of such a country is doing well and another part is not .
how is that possible ?
that is the way to bring it together .
increased stability in the employment strategy is indeed necessary .
the other approach was quite different .
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur .
that would be a welcome step forward .
i am in agreement with the main objectives of the new employment policy and should like to call attention in particular to the second objective .
in other words , i think that we need to do some work on this in the coming period .
we must start to show an interest in this kind of debate and initiative .
in short , nothing has happened .
i would like to end with a comment .
women also need support .
governments need to do what is necessary to address this .
my third point has to do with women .
the debate is closed .
mr president , this is indeed an important issue .
i could do so , but it would take about ten minutes .
we say this : we are not under any real pressure of time !
we say this : let the convention and the intergovernmental conference , put forward a new and better proposal .
we therefore do have enough time .
my proposal to use population as one of these criteria has not found support among a majority in the committee so far this time .
why , therefore , this proposal to change the voting system ?
this is not , therefore , the real reason behind the proposed reform .
the principle should be one of ' one member , one vote ' .
everyone seems to agree that reform is necessary .
it is not , however , entirely clear what that reform is to look like .
i think that this will be important for the small countries .
it will also be significant for the new member states .
why ?
this is unacceptable .
not everyone will be present .
the debate is closed .
mr president , the commissioner obviously wanted to say something just now , and perhaps i can ask him a question at the same time .
what would interest me is this : what will be the institutional framework for all this ?
will there be specific responsibility within the commission for this area of cooperation ?
these are the questions that interest me .
that is not the subject of this communication .
i have a long list of members before me .
i really only have one question .
i would like to ask two questions .
i think this is an important point .
however , the other countries will still need a long period of internal development .
perhaps the commission could review this position once again .
what interests me is what the commission 's strategy says about this issue .
what form will the financial instrument take ?
however , this is not the time or the document for that debate .
that will be the policy that we continue .
finally , i am pleased to have the opportunity to answer the honourable member 's question on this because it is one we have discussed in the past .
mr president , i think the house is going to have the benefit of the president after the external affairs commissioner has made one or two points .
the debate is closed .
part i
what can the commission do to improve the situation ?
that is the only thing that we can do . at the end of the day it is also the only thing that will help .
i would therefore ask you to call my question again .
i know all of this .
however , commissioner , you did not answer the basic aspects of the question .
that is the connection .
the commission is therefore already doing what you asked me to do at the end of your statement .
that is the situation that we find in these countries .
part two
we are sure that we will find a solution to this problem that takes account of the practical situation .
yet i would ask you to be more specific .
can you be more specific ?
however , given the importance of the issue , i believe more information should be provided .
we do actually need to do much more here .
i would therefore say that this is a task for all of us .
what is more , this is not even a subject for which i am responsible .
how can we guarantee that ?
that is part of the decision that was made in this house .
but the decision was made and i stand by it .
the next item is the joint debate on economic and monetary union :
mr president , i would like to welcome the commissioner to this sitting .
nothing at all would have become of it .
mr president , i will try within the time available to me to comment on the four reports presented to us .
you know what our position is in relation to them .
in this respect we have every reason to thank the commission for the line that it is taking .
but we need this answer to know which direction is the right one .
nor must we now go back on that .
commissioner , the council has just expressed its opinion on your statement .
i think we need to go further and we must do so at the convention .
mr president , our group voted against this report in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
can we really not do any better than this ?
now is the time for action .
what is more , we also need competition in the tax field , that is to say between european tax systems .
in other words , we need , in the future too , an economic policy for which the member states themselves continue to be responsible .
i believe not .
and this is true .
the debate is closed .
the second point i should like to make is that this directive has also clearly shown the problems we have where legislative procedure is concerned .
today we have the second reading debate , and tomorrow the vote .
this directive is a success for the european parliament .
it is a first step .
given the council 's position , that was not possible .
the directive is an important step in the right direction , however .
mr president , the commission would like to thank the european parliament and especially the rapporteur .
in those circumstances , i would support it .
we look forward to more progress , particularly on some of the tax issues .
overall this is an excellent measure .
we voted against this report at the first reading at the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
meeting our requirements as it does , though , this directive is extremely important .
i am also very pleased with this compromise .
that is certainly true .
finally , mr president , the tax issue .
while we still have a long way to go , i think that all in all we have certainly made a start .
that is a subject for social policy .
it has been an issue of compromise all the way through .
compromise was very necessary .
that is a statement of fact .
i hope that we will come back to this discussion at a later date .
what do old people want ?
at least it is an agreed text .
that is what we need on this most important subject .
therefore the commission has no opinion on them .
that is a good thing .
the debate is closed .
iraq
the next item is the council and the commission statement on iraq .
the honourable members are well aware of the rules of procedure .
you know what they are .
naturally , we - the union - have our views , but it is at the un that the decisions are taken .
we have taken important initiatives here .
a second important area concerns relations between the united states and the european union .
so we are also working with them .
europe is a community of values .
( applause )
but that is not my point .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
i want to ask two questions .
( applause )
that is true of our group .
( applause )
the same will be true now .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
why ?
( applause )
( applause )
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there are some things that i just cannot understand .
i do not understand it .
what , then , are we doing with turkey ?
i simply do not understand it .
( applause from the left )
from then on , once this principle has been established , the decisions will not be taken in this house .
i believe that there is .
mr president , this is a very special day for me in the european parliament .
( applause from the right )
it is our view that if , in fact , any military decisions are to be taken , they must be taken by the un security council .
mr president , what is this war about ?
i shall stop there , for i have no more speaking time left .
that is unfortunately not the case .
why ?
we accept , however , that they have made progress .
if that is the case , why was this not done long ago ?
thank you .
we believe that there will be one .
however , first of all , let us hope that there will be a majority in the security council .
obviously , we have not found a final answer to this question .
that is not a success .
but for how long ?
at what point do we say enough is enough ?
the european union and the united states must find joint initiatives within the framework of the international order .
this is where europe has become less important .
we are further away than ever from having a common foreign and security policy .
one might perhaps wish that they were working still better , but progress is at present being made .
mr president , what has happened to the eu 's common foreign and security policy ?
we are where we are today because of that .
that remains as true today as when it was first said .
the final objective is quite specific and we are all agreed on it .
and if there are , how long should this assessment take ?
however , we do have a common position .
my third point , and this was a question raised by a number of members , concerns the crisis in the united states .
how are we going to deal with these issues ?
how are we going to deal with terrorism ?
this is where europe has an important part to play .
i should like to say here that you , the european parliament , have a very important part to play .
here again the european parliament has an important role to play .
i think we all need to keep up our efforts to bring about democratic change in turkey .
( applause )
we want them in the council , we want them in the european institutions .
( applause )
( applause )
you said very clearly that parliament had an important role to play .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , many thanks for that welcome .
there are , though , two aspects of it to which i would now like to draw attention .
work that out if you can .
why is this so ?
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
joint motion for a resolution
i therefore voted in favour of the report .
it should also be public .
and it is they who have voted for the creation of public services .
we voted against it .
let it be taken up .
i voted for it , naturally , but i should still like to make a point .
that approach is unacceptable .
the decision means a reduction in confidence in the euro as a currency .
it goes without saying that i cannot accept such a possibility .
are there any comments ?
( ? he minutes were approved )
our objectives are clear .
we cannot go on this way .
i do not think that this is really something we should welcome .
my second question concerns the way in which decisions are implemented .
peace has not yet been established .
mr president-in-office , commissioner , you are aware of that .
that is clearly the case and we should take it into account .
let me now turn to the business in hand .
there has been no ' agreement ' and no ' decision ' so far .
it was more a question of when to bring this matter to the attention of parliament and in what form .
we only have a short time .
i stress that there is no agreement , there is no decision .
this is the first step in the process .
these discussions are necessary .
why are they necessary ?
clearly we need more time and information from the united states before we can say that we have a solution .
that i think is a major step forward .
thus , a fundamental right of european citizens is now at risk .
and that is not all .
how can this be ?
who do the united states think they are ?
what does that mean ?
i would like to hear what you have to say on that as well .
commissioner , i will focus on procedure first : you say it is not a question of a legislative act , a community act .
the commissioner says that no agreement or decision has been reached and that , therefore , there is no legal basis for such action .
what have we done to allow this to happen ?
so this is a very serious matter .
i might add one question and one answer .
this procedure is quite simply unacceptable .
it is already clear that we need to fight terrorism .
our fight for security cannot and must not call freedom into question .
a form of technical data protection has , however , been established , which is obviously quite effective , and perhaps as effective as it can be .
global discussions are obviously required in this case , and not only with the united states .
what is at issue here ?
the aim is to protect people .
and what information , commissioner , mr president !
the american side has accepted that .
we have not yet reached the end of the road - far from it .
we have not yet achieved an agreement .
that is not to say that there is not more to do .
that is true .
a question has also been raised about discussions to be held at political level .
i hope to be able to discuss further developments in this area with parliament as appropriate .
my question to council was tabled as no 3 .
all i want is an answer .
mr president , i am one of a group of members who have tabled questions to the council .
we all know which un resolution i mean , so there is no need for me to refer to it at this point .
we can see what has happened .
negotiations are still under way .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , thank you for your answer .
what is the presidency 's view on this matter ?
i thank the honourable member for his questions .
i have just two comments .
is this possible ?
i must stress this .
it is true that the commission should take the initiative , but i would like to know how , as president-in-office of the council , you are going to support this proposal by parliament .
we are prepared to do what we can to promote regulations for us and , of course , at international level .
why not give this a try ?
i believe that these organisations need money and the support of members of the public .
thank you very much , mr president-in-office of the council , for the information you have just given me .
the council has not yet reached a decision on these issues .
i therefore welcome the important initiatives taken by the european parliament .
subject : enlargement
so do you not think that it is urgent that the union should propose the same to those countries ?
thank you for your question .
it is on our agenda and we shall take measures over the next few days if any special support is needed .
we propose a number of measures in the report .
this is very much a debate for the european parliament rather than the european commission .
i think that this second point is just as fundamental .
why ?
i cannot see that very much in particular , or even anything at all , has happened in the five years since then .
i know this so well because i was involved myself .
no , that is not how it is .
the debate is closed .
that is my first point .
mr president , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur .
good work has been done .
cohesion policy , the european social fund and the structural funds are very important in terms of developing cooperation within the eu .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
i would like to give you an example of what i consider to be unacceptable .
i am of course pleased that it has finally been possible to find a solution here .
we hope to make significant progress in this field this year .
this is a key moment .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
a major debate is now under way about consumer policy .
some in her party have asked why that should be there .
firstly , a high level of consumer protection .
we need to show the accession states that we can do better than that and help them to do the same .
it needs the whole force of the commission and the member states to bring this about .
all of us agree with that .
there is also going to be a need to provide consumers with special protection in certain sectors .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
both are objectives of the treaty and each can support the other .
it has three key objectives .
the first is to achieve a high common level of consumer protection .
i can only express my thanks for that .
mr president , now i come to the green paper .
in that sense we can vote for a framework directive .
that is right and proper .
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
point two , the right to information .
my final point concerns political responsibility .
or take the euro , another example .
of course , things can go against us .
thank you very much .
mr president , we are dealing here with three important reports of course .
it is true that it is not legislation , but i look forward with interest to the legislation that will follow these reports .
i do that with a great deal of confidence , because on this point too we have every confidence in this commissioner .
consumers often do not know what their rights are .
consumer organisations can help with this .
people have a lot of confidence in these organisations .
we did not create this article for nothing and it will benefit both the consumer and the internal market .
why is this ?
i see the subject of transparency as having had far too small a part to play in this morning 's debate as a whole .
we need all these things .
the main principle , one which has been raised here very often , is that levels of consumer protection must be as high as possible .
that , again , does not add up to much .
i therefore see no need for a framework directive in this area .
work on consumer protection should make information policy a priority .
i will start with the points relating to the framework directive and then i will address some points on the action plan .
there are a number of different aspects .
this is an issue we are also taking into account .
the debate is closed .
mr president , there is something i would like to have done in this house .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the treaty of amsterdam and the regulations relating to the structural funds also make mention of this .
even if there were no eu , agreements would have to be made between different countries on common support for these rights .
as always , in the end it comes down , however , to the content of the agreements and not the fact that everything is subject to the same regulations .
i would like , in my statement , to focus on the issues i have just mentioned , but before doing so , there are two other points i would like to address .
all these provisions will have to be applied in the future member states from the moment of their accession .
the european union 's priority is employment .
even today the case has still not fully come to light or been brought to justice .
the real problem , however , is not even that .
that is the reality .
what are we going to do about it ?
that is what the commission has to encourage .
nothing .
such a possibility does not at present exist in the treaty .
what this is about is increasing the level of employment in these regions .
we can see difficulties in this as regards data protection .
that is a fact , and we have to live with it .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would first like to thank the commission .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we have been at this for years .
what have we to show for all this ?
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , commissioner .
so you still have a little time , commissioner .
and here we are voting on another resolution .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place in a moment .
( parliament adopted the joint resolution )
that is not in the interests of this honourable house .
that was the last item on the agenda .
welcome
( applause from the left )
i shall follow that decision and respect the procedures involved .
a third important problem is the stability of the region as a whole .
i think that , within this , we shall face another two important issues .
of that there can be no doubt .
this cooperation , mr president , honourable members , has shown that the conflict in iraq is not and must not be a cultural war or conflict .
it was a very good and responsible debate .
president .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
we must remain true to it .
( applause )
i should like to add one point here .

our current situation is really very difficult .
and that is our responsibility .
( applause from the left )
( applause from the left )
( applause from the left )
there is no place for this in today 's world .
this is unacceptable .
( applause from the left )
this is therefore a responsibility for the commission .
we must live in a positive way .
( applause from the left )
this is an essential point .
( applause from the left )
mr president , this is not a just war .
but then what ?
i must say that i have not heard any comments this morning on the fundamental issue .
( applause from the left )
( applause from the left )
but even then , we shall not have heard the last of this .
this is what they expect of us .
( applause from the left )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
i therefore believe that the decision to use force was taken several months ago .
this is not true , ladies and gentlemen !
that is the reality of the situation .
this is how things are ; this is the reality of the situation !
why do we not go for that instead of making a common eu military force ?
( applause from the right )
( applause from the left )
that has to be said first .
( applause from the left )
for this we need a strong europe and a strong united nations .
( applause from the left )
what must our agenda be ?
and long live france !
'
perhaps the only thing that could be done there is talk , but that will at least be doing something to achieve peace .
( applause from the right )
( applause )
the un resolutions are clear in this respect .
( applause from the right )
question one : where to now ?
down with war !
long live peace between nations !
all we can do is hope that it will come to an end as quickly as possible .
( applause from the right )
iraq will need a very great deal of help .
it is the basic principle of democracy .
but here again we have an important responsibility .
that is what the european union is . a community of values .
a community of principles .
whether this will come about today , tomorrow or in a few months ' time , i do not know .
i should like to answer three of the points that were raised in this debate .
( applause )
( applause )
institutional change can certainly help to create political will .
i do not doubt that at all .
( applause )
i have taken a number , but many more colleagues wish to speak .
this was the third european council summit meeting with this agenda .
the presidency did not agree with these views .
we have a direct interest in developments in iraq .
you shall have your opportunity to speak .
the final priority is environmental protection for growth and jobs .
what are they ?
now i should like to say something on the subject of iraq .
that is our objective .
peace and progress in the region .
no , it is not .
there was no point in discussing it .
and that is what we did .
ladies and gentlemen , what is our objective ?
from the common agricultural policy through to immigration policy .
and it will be some time before they do .
i will therefore begin my speech today with that .
let us start with security .
the european citizens have already made it clear what they want .
the european convention has created a working group on defence .
( applause )
that , ladies and gentlemen , is precisely why there is no time to waste .
( applause )
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
we must make use of the community institutions and work together in them !
( applause from the right )
this is where governments must take some action at last !
we wish you success in your efforts to do this .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
humanitarian aid must get through .
they have every right to do so .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
so what ?
there has been much talk of one .
why not ?
unfortunately , it did not do so .
however , not just any kind of employment will achieve that .
what means does the council plan to use to prevent turkey from doing this ?
is that really our aim ?
that is precisely where we stand at the moment .
now , the war is under way , however , and we must look to the future .
we need a common foreign policy .
what can and should we do ?
( applause from the left )
yet you say we can do nothing about it and we should change the subject .
but what is the presidency 's role ?
that is the first thing it has to do .
why ?
because the european union has applied a foreign policy .
are there only a few ?
there are only a few .
we have to make that effort .
the union 's foreign policy , like every other policy , is created .
and it is up to us .
but we do want a union !
and we want a strong union .
finally , i should like to refer to a number of comments made on economic policy .
that is clear from the text .
now , we must look forward , as in part does the resolution , i am pleased to say .
that is the most important aspect of the resolution we are to vote on .
many of us here are concerned about the future of the world and of europe .
i congratulate it on that . i would however point out that at present what is required of us is humanitarian aid for those most in need .
what is this right that we are talking about ?
it is time for us to put in place a common defence policy , and it will be necessary for us to provide ourselves with the resources to do so .
we need to move , to make the convention a success and to make our future together a success too .
mr president , of course a democratic process is needed in iraq , but war is never a solution .
we do not think this is the case .
if you do not do so , we will not have a common policy .
action is what we need .
the situation in iraq , though , is quite different .
while there really are not yet sufficient reasons for it , this war is - unfortunately - a reality .
we still have our responsibility for the future .
i hope to find this all in the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow .
it is high time all the member states together took another look at the common foreign and security policy and the defence policy , and the best place for that is the european convention .
( applause from the left )
as far as research and development is concerned , let me be positive .
good for him .
i would like to discuss three things .
it was important , in these difficult times , for the european governments to express a common political will to continue their efforts in the social field .
it is also called ' more united nations ' .
the united states cannot decide , alone and on the basis of its own national interests , what is right in this world and what is not .
are they fundamental reasons ?
i have set out the problem , but it is not my job to provide the solution to it .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
this is quite clearly a legal problem , and it is also a problem in terms of a fundamental issue .
i do not understand the council .
what we are working towards here is a right and a matter of principle .
let us be clear : that it is an objective which we all want to reach .
that is what we are doing .
as , therefore , there will be negotiations on the matter tomorrow , i would rather say no more today .
for parliament now to say that a deal is a deal is of course to the point .
we consider it as a joint objective .
we have a joint objective to make a success of this process .
i do not think that the european parliament can go further than it does in the motion for a resolution .
a balance of powers between the institutions is essential for the stability of cooperation within the eu .
allow me to give an example .
in this case , however , it is the people who will take the decision .
the debate is closed .
that has been the central part of our task .
what about the new principles ?
i would like to refer to one of these amendments which i believe to be very important for parliament and for the other european institutions .
time is short and i should therefore like to focus in my speech on three amendments .
these amendments are very positive .
the commissioner also referred to it .
up to now i have not heard the commissioner say that he would not follow parliament 's wish on this point .
the debate is closed .
then there is the cost .
however , i would like to draw the attention of the parliament to three particular issues raised in the resolution , where the commission could face some difficulties with implementation .
it is better to try to achieve an equal level of use throughout the different member states .
that cannot be right ; it does not work that way .
we can do that if we want to .
i also try not to do that myself .
the debate is closed .
we must continue to look at this issue .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i welcome this report and some of those we have seen going through parliament in the last few months .
we need a new system .
the debate is closed .
why not ?
the same cannot be said , however , for the way funds are being used on social measures , and this is where there are problems .
item 3 of your resolution does , of course , have something to do with this .
i think two of these are extremely relevant .
this is the state of affairs after the programme has been in action for more than a year !
the debate is closed .
but we need to make decisions quickly if we are going to act quickly .
the global health fund , of course , is not available for research .
that is the idea behind the proposal .
it is a good time to set up joint projects , therefore .
secondly , we must focus on developing specific products .
i ask that the commissioner and the commission continue to give due attention to this , too .
i think that that last point , in particular , is extremely important .
this can only be achieved if agreement can be reached by member countries of the world trade organisation .
we have been able to put across important points despite working quickly .
other actions are needed but this particular action is research .
what have the member states done ?
what , in practical terms , has the commission done ?
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report before us today is a crucial one .
a new kind of cooperation is needed .
might this not be what we in the european union need to help others ?
but first of all we need to put this programme into practice .
we will only make our financial contribution once the joint programme is under way .
at the time , the council decided not to do so .
i would particularly like to thank you for that on the commission 's behalf .
that is the risk .
but we do not agree entirely on every point .
this is being discussed .
that also has to be made very clear .
i find all this unacceptable .
unfortunately , we still do not really have a community policy for european home affairs and justice .
once again , we have taken the second step before the first .
these are basic issues .
is there a public demand for this ?
that is where i am coming from .
what we need is more cooperation between states and the commission - between authorities .
we need more internal reforms .
the current system does not work .
i do not see it this way at all .
we have provided the financial control to deal with that .
( applause )
i support it on behalf of my group .
( applause )
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolutions , 1 to 12 )
before the vote :
i think that parliament should be given further information as to the results of this dialogue before taking a decision .
i look forward to that final vote .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
the problem has been under discussion within the who for months .
all 15 member states should follow europe 's example !
we support the just demands of the workers and their movement .
you should do as we have done !
'
the efforts of all member states and the eu must therefore focus on four priority objectives .
it is true that they are not yet members , but is it possible to discuss the convention without them ?
that is our position .
that is the only issue which needed to be raised today .
you did not want a resolution .
it is vital for research to continue in this sector .
this is clearly not the case .
' ' but of course we are !
not a problem !
something must be done .
i have voted against paragraph 1 on ' ?
the following changes have been proposed :
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the humanitarian situation in iraq is clear to us all .
we have all been aware of that for a long time , however .
i am therefore against such a statement .
and the best way to do this would be to talk and to reach an agreement on humanitarian aid .
i shall follow that matter up in the light of your comments .
your response to the present situation was indeed the right one .
mr president , a number of members have expressed concern about the humanitarian situation in iraq .
where does it come from ?
how can we stop it ?
what will we be saying to people at next year 's european elections ?
is that the european union that we want our citizens to live in ?
no !
so far , we have not achieved them .
at this stage , what can be said ?
we do not , however , know that for sure .
it is therefore high time the european union took action .
i have discussed this with a number of members of this house , and with a number of government ministers , for quite some time now .
i know that a lot of people in the house are concerned about this .
i am also concerned about it .
we need to change that .
the debate is closed .
some of the amendments proposed improve on the council 's common position and the commission takes a positive view of them .
this directive is important for several reasons .
would that transport system look like our present one ?
we have tabled an amendment to that effect , but it was unfortunately not accepted .
that is not possible .
i think that the fact that the report will be accepted tomorrow and will in fact be implemented is much more important .
i hope that it will be possible to put it into force quickly .
my proposals now simply go too far .
i think that the aim of the directive is very clear .
we want to improve road safety .
for this reason , i would like to ask you to give your attention to this .
i will be coming back to this .
so far only two member states have this kind of training .
many thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent work .
the member states therefore need time to implement this .
madam president , first of all i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i would like to thank them for that .
i think , today , we are going to decide on a great programme .
i shall mention , first of all , amendment no 1 tabled by parliament .
as for the budget , i fully understand what the rapporteur said .
i would , however , like to make a comment about this report .
commissioner , you said that you accept certain amendments but not others .
what do we expect of ourselves , and what do we have to offer ?
that cannot work without education .
we live in an internal market where there is free movement of people .
cooperation , in this case , takes second place to competition .
there is nothing free in this world .
the debate is closed .
i would also point out that the amendments to the european commission 's proposal have been agreed with both the commission 's services and the council representatives .
i believe the third action to be the most important , as it concerns our children .
i was pleased to note parliament 's interest in this action .
information and communication will therefore receive particular attention .
that cannot , and must not , become more than an additional area .
mr president , first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report .
i would just like to mention three points .
mr president , i welcome this report and the commission 's response to parliament 's amendments .
i fully support the budget increase .
i hope that will be the case in relation to ireland .
after all , the question ' what for ?
can it also be used for this ?
i therefore thank the rapporteur for his excellent work .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
1 .
2 .
3 .
4 .
5 .
that is not the case at present .
as i say in my report , together with the committee on budgetary control , this objective has not in fact been achieved .
i do not think that this is a good thing .
we accepted this as part of the new financial regulation .
all these programmes have different rules .
but is that enough ?
no , it is not .
that is the only way to have very good financial management .
it is of course a difficult programme , especially in times like these , but it is a very important one .
2001 was anything but a good year for the structural funds .
the member states are far from having used all the money available to them .
we all know what that means .
i come now to the european social fund itself .
i really cannot understand this .
we hope that this will be taken into account during the next budgetary year .
i ask you to vote in favour .
i do not think that is what we understand by ' taking into account ' .
it is important to note that .
secondly , a financial regulation has been adopted .
nor could we do that .
i should like to say a little about agriculture .
in a united europe , the systems should be the same .
we were not equal to the task .
unfortunately , it did not work out like that .
the eu was not created yesterday .
in this context the reality is other people 's money .
it takes time .
we are back with the reform here , commissioner .
that is not the way .
then we can see whether the commission really makes any progress in the coming six months .
i share those concerns , but the commission has made excellent progress in the last few months .
it would be good if the convention were to make progress on this .
there are more such cases .
we do not need them .
this has been of major concern to all the members of the committee .
they pay full respect to financial regulation .
we are giving budgetary support to countries such as these .
that was in 2001 .
we obviously hope that will be the case , but the world bank took four years .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
i look to their support and cooperation in this regard .
we do not agree .
i could therefore only vote in favour of the report .
this is what you must say !
' and that is what i am saying .
it is an important conference .
what is this actually all about , mr president ?
i cannot do that .
this is not true !
it is for this proposal that i ask for the house 's support .
i could almost believe it .
the answer is ' no ' ; it has at least as many .
this report states a basic position . it is not a response to the current situation , as some would have us believe .
however , to get a good majority , i believe , is possible .
it will not work .
we know what he is after .
this is something i cannot accept .
the report we have here has considerable impact .
i do not believe in that position at all .
i do not think much of that .
they have hope .
there is nothing better than hope in the fight against the drugs trade .
the best thing society can do to help is not to increase access to drugs of any type .
this i cannot agree to .
this policy has had good results .
the debate is closed .
the council has already reached a political agreement to accept the commission draft .
she had a very difficult job to do .
the commission 's first proposal was well received by this house .
would this not be more practical ?
having said that , i believe that the directive concerns a very central area of the debate on immigration and integration .
all of this must stop .
we in the group of the european people 's party shall support it .
mr president , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
the commission has established this strategy in a clear way .
a change of policy is therefore needed .
of course stability is a public good !
we could go on to discuss it further , but , of course , time is much too short .
mr president , i have three questions .
how , as the commission , do you view this ?
what , in practical terms , is being done at european level ?
i am parliament 's rapporteur when it comes to the guidelines we are discussing now .
these are unacceptable conditions , but i must not waste any more time talking about this right now .
i want instead to address a political issue that i believe to be a major issue .
i would like to ask a question , mr president .
that would result in a significant amount of pressure on national governments .
mr president , i will reply quickly .
it is not a foreign policy or any other issue .
part i
if not why not ?
i thank you , commissioner , for that reply .
this is a serious problem .
why this change ?
we do not think so .
until when ?
we are in the process of discussing this with the council of ministers , which , as is so often the case where trade policy is concerned , has the last word on this matter .
this decision will be made by the commission during the course of next year .
is there an agreement with the united nations for ' the day after ' ?
that is where that discussion should start .
thank you very much for your reply , commissioner .
so there is still a great deal to do .
when will the commission present the proposal to the council ?
furthermore , many different sectors are involved in civil protection .
thank you for your answer , commissioner , but i still have a few questions .
there cannot be more than two questions .
we are at the moment .
this is a matter of implementation .
but this also takes implementation ; member states must be serious about that .
the response from the commission has been a serious one .
now it is a matter of implementation at member state level as well .
this is the work of civil protection authorities in each and every member state .
this point is very important .
we have such different views on this .
this is a completely different issue .
mr president , commissioner , the first part of my question is crucial ; it is absolutely fundamental .
there is one on this issue .
i am fully aware of that .
we will begin the final part of question time .
for its part , turkey will also receive more european funds for the same objective .
but the council has not set a date .
unfortunately , we do not yet have a response from the council .
there is also a data protection problem .
thank you very much .
( applause )
this is , above all , the responsibility of our governments .
there is much that the governments of the region can do , and there is much that is being done .
unemployment , particularly among the young , is extremely high .
( applause )
( applause )
we thank you .
however , commissioner , it is my opinion that you should take also serious account of the proposals of the european parliament .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following three reports :
it is now for all of us to ensure that the convention is a success .
we are all in agreement .
i do not think that there is more to be said on the subject .
my colleagues can use my speaking time if they really want to .
with that in mind , many thanks for your contribution .
that regulation must be applied .
i hope it will have your support .
the debate is closed .
that is not by any means the case at the present time .
this is something we also wish to see as a result of this work .
the debate is closed .
with regard to the content , i will focus on just two points .
on the one hand , the question of the legal basis .
i will speak first about the general objectives of this joint strategy and then about how it will be implemented .
we should be a better state that what the public has at home .
there is something not quite right here .
the european union is made up of all of us !
'
no , they are not !
no , they are not !
i do not believe it will .
why not ?
what does this mean ?
so those of us who believe in democracy have a problem .
there is a responsibility upon member states .
therefore i hope that this strategy will improve step by step .
the debate is closed .
they are here to follow our debate .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
there is still much to be done , however .
( applause )
( applause )
some have already expressed their will .
everyone has a right to share in this future .
what will they bring to the european union ?
it is in the interests of the new member states to want a strong community .
will the new member states allow themselves to be part of a common european foreign policy ?
( applause )
the last question , honourable members , is one we must ask of ourselves .
from the technical point of view , we are .
now that , today , the decision is upon us , i therefore ask you to vote in favour !
( applause )
our group has always had that as its objective .
( applause )
you may ask why we are voting in this way .
the market was increased but people 's rights were not .
they want a better future .
they have to understand that when we in europe want to say no , we will say no .
in any case , what had do be done , will have been done .
.
i believe we have found the right way forward together there .
!
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , i am able to report to you today on the conclusion of a successful process .
let us take a look at ourselves here in the european union .
we are all europe .
not new europe and old europe .
there will not be a second opportunity of this kind .
said to our group yesterday .
clearly , we have not reached the end of the process .
the time has now come to go forward together .
today is a new beginning .
the european model of cooperation must therefore be successful .
at least they were acceptable .
that has cost the council money .
the real work , however , is about to begin .
there is much to be said about them , but unfortunately i can only deal with a few points .
this not only applies to the accession countries but also to our own member states .
that is going too far !
let there be an end to this .
( applause )
there are several reasons for this .
that is why i will vote ' no ' to all ten countries ' accession .
the economic and democratic criteria , however , while necessary , are not enough . we do not really know each other yet .
we do not yet view the world in the same way .
i believe we have done enough talking now .
the time has come for action .
the debate is closed .
for this reason i shall be voting today in favour of the accession of ten new member states .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
president .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote :
why ?
we still have a great deal of work to do , particularly in the area of foreign policy .
. ( de ) today , the european parliament has approved the accession of ten states to the european union .
europe is united in freedom .
enlargement from the outside is taking place .
. ( de ) today , the european parliament has voted to accept the accession of ten states to the european union .
this does not mean our work is done of course .
monitoring too must be taken seriously .
and yet i voted in favour .
after all , political stability , peace and security create the conditions for all other policy objectives .
i am in favour of a common european foreign policy .
my final important point is the reform of agricultural policy .
that i cannot do .
i shall now give the second of these .
i cannot go along with that .
enlargement has already taken too long .
it is on this basis alone that a united europe has a future .
the young people of europe share in but one common future - europe !
i would now like to make my last point , mr president .
i hope that they will soon come back .
the next item is the report ( ?
i think there are at least three reasons for this .
i am not sure .
current events , i have to say , show that this is far from being the case .
it is a matter of us in the european union together following a european view in military affairs .
i hope the amendments presented by our group will be adopted . then we should be able to vote in favour of this proposal without any problem .
it is the wish of parliament , and we will support you .
where do we want to act ?
what precisely do we need for it ?
when do we want to do it ?
this seems very good to me .
in my opinion , this decision is coming too soon .
let us now be completely clear about this .
mr president , it is always the same .
this is the only and the best contribution france can make to what remains of europe .
i am however in favour of an open process .
until we do that there will be no future for the european union .
this european union contribution is a success .
nevertheless , this is a discussion about extremely practical matters , which can only really start now .
madam president , recent events show that the eu member states cannot now and will not in the future agree on the organisation of a common defence policy .
this makes it difficult to establish a common defence policy .
what are we doing ?
to see where we stand .
why is that necessary ?
these were successful only because we had specific requirements on content and time , because we were clear about what we want to do and when we wanted to be able to do it .
i think it should be put into effect .
europe is a force for peace ; however , it also needs to become a force for security and international cooperation .
the initiative by germany and the other three countries is positive in principle .
i do not think so .
it is in that area that the eu can make considerable efforts in the cause of peace .
this report is a positive step , as was the report presented in this house a few years ago by the president .
take kosovo , for example .
in kosovo , the citizens wanted the european union to ? .
we need a common european approach .
that is a fact .
i see that as unacceptable .
that , in turn , requires us to think european .
i hope this will be successful .
the common policy is particularly important for small countries within the eu .
that is a fact of which we must take account in developing the common security policy for the eu .
i do not believe that the purpose of the eu 's security policy should , in the first place , be to develop strong , joint military power .
cooperation with the global community must of course be central in this connection .
unfortunately they are right .
perhaps we shall finally find an answer to the question of what we want to do together .
the debate is closed .
is this issue included in your general position ?
that is another matter .
this is why my question has not been allowed .
i am simply talking about the rules of procedure .
the president of the council asked me a question just now .
this is not any other type of debate .
thank you , mr president-in-office of the council .
this has nothing to do with law and order .
it has to do with freedom of movement .
mr president , i would like to thank the minister for his reply .
if so , how high is it on the agenda ?
is the presidency of the council ?
does the council know whether the commission is taking any such action ?
i shall look into the matter .
i agree with the honourable member .
a solution has to be found .
however , there are three reasons why i ask this question .
those are the reasons for my question .
i would again point out that there is no new question here .
i think that this issue has to do with proposals by the european commission as to how these initiatives can be taken into account .
there are various problems in relation to the employment rate , which we are also trying to increase .
i want to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
the council cannot comment on this specific proposal and programme because , as i said , it is being discussed within the two institutions .
i think that my reply to the question put by the honourable member was very , very clear and very specific .
now let me turn to some of your key concerns .
in other words , the commission 's proposal is good , but it does not go far enough .
we really cannot present that kind of proposal to the public .
the key is the protection of human health .
we need to consider whether it has a place in this measure or not .
we must find a way to stop that .
we must get the balance right .
however , i cannot entirely support all the amendments tabled by some of my colleagues .
therefore commissioner , i would like to hear from you what you think .
in my view , we need very clear european legislation in this area .
i do not have time to go into all the other problems with this report .
mr president , the report and the proposal for a directive are important from health and safety points of view .
finally , let me make one comment about the legal basis .
i share many of your concerns with regard to these issues .
this will take some time .
i have said i will , but i cannot do it now .
if , with that information , you feel it necessary to vote against this legislation , so be it .
but i would ask you not to do so .
through this proposal the community can establish significant new standards for the health of our citizens .
the debate is closed .
firstly , many thanks to the commission and the commissioner .
the debate is closed .
this initiative is in line with the european parliament proposal to increase the transparency of the commission budget .
mr president , i would like to thank the commission for being present in this debate .
therefore it is quite important that we look at these .
i support the commission 's proposal to create a clear financial basis for this support .
the debate is closed .
this is in the interest of consumer protection .
two amendments have been proposed .
why is that ?
i would like to comment on two amendments and would like to hear the commission 's view on them .
what does the rapporteur know that we do not ?
that information was not given to the committee .
no information was given to the committee !
i think we must all take note of this .
for this reason , i fully support the proposal put forward by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
the commission can accept these amendments .
this is always a difficult task .
the commission cannot accept this amendment for the following reasons .
this is done from time to time .
therefore , the commission cannot accept amendments 2 and 3 .
the debate is closed .
instead , right at the start of the process , we want to move on to new products that are sustainable .
there is work for us all to do here .
the key aspects of this regulation are health , consumer safety and the protection of and respect for the environment .
madam president , i would like to express a word of thanks to the commissioner .
but the commissioner has also said that this is good for the internal market .
you cannot therefore say that this is good for the internal market .
it really can be done .
then there is another problem .
it is also a matter of public health .
madam president , i welcome this proposal .
i would ask one question , however .
this proposal does not fully address that question .
we must act on that issue .
i do not believe that that is enough .
i shall only mention two .
on this point i agree with the rapporteur 's approach .
i wish , however , to make a few comments on two issues that i consider to be extremely important and on which i tabled proposals for amendments in the committee on industry .
madam president , i too think that this is a good proposal .
there are four points i should like to make .
secondly , the criteria must be clear .
it must also be clear that under no circumstances may economic criteria come into play .
this is a measure we could have taken through in one reading .
i wish it well and again congratulate our rapporteur .
perhaps i could group the questions around six groups of amendments on which i can comment one by one .
there is no urgent need at eu level on this matter .
the other amendments are not acceptable to the commission .
the debate is closed .
we therefore wanted a ban .
we must accept matters as they stand .
it is certainly a step forward in the protection of human health .
the debate is closed .
however , market access alone is not enough .
indeed that is something we aim to do and we also have the necessary policy instruments .
we want a statement and an action plan .
is the commissioner going ?
how can they get away with it ?
why is that issue not on the wto agenda ?
where , too , in the political institutions of our member states ?
i very much hope that this will meet with a response .
i will , however , make a few comments .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament approved the joint text )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
' .
the reality is unfortunately different .
i have supported this way thus far and will continue to do so .
why not ?
for this reason , we did not vote in favour of the report .
i have therefore voted against the report .
defence is a national issue .
we shall therefore vote against the report .
we therefore voted against this report .
we call for peace and cooperation , not war .
i have therefore voted against the report .
if we had done this , we would have made a practical contribution towards european security .
mr president , this is an important issue .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place following this debate .
this is not , however , what has happened .
i wish , however , to say something further about the action that we feel should be taken .
we must put a stop to this .
mr president , a great deal has already been said .
we understand them and are in solidarity with them .
mr president , i wish to make a point of order .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place following this debate .
article 2 of this treaty requires respect for human rights and democratic principles .
of course not .
mr president , i thank you once more for the fact that you have given me the floor on this important subject .
it is therefore with this issue that i shall start .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place now .
i wish you well in your time and your work here in parliament .
the following changes are proposed :
no legislative procedure is therefore required .
the security council should now speak out about this .
i am sure ireland is not alone in this .
thank you .
that is all i can tell you .
there were no other conditions .
you will have to speak tomorrow .
the commission has done well to come forward with this programme .
this programme will help .
thank you very much , mr president .
of course , there is a lot more to it than this .
the second point is about the budget .
it is too little , even though it is better than nothing .
we welcome this .
we must look far into the future .
that is clear , and that is the direction in which we must move .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
and why is all of this the case ?
i would like to say that , in general terms , we will support the text of the report with the amendments proposed .
there are a number of amendments tabled .
the directive is not needed just because it will help to protect the single energy market .
i should like to call upon him to continue this cooperation until the end , to ensure that we achieve a good result tomorrow .
that , at any rate , is what the environment committee has decided .
i would once again like to thank the rapporteur .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
they do not have a problem with this .
that is something we want to try to avoid .
i feel we have achieved this .
there are still some areas of concern .
that is something that she is right to continue to develop .
we should return to that at a later stage .
we should be prepared to take time to make that assessment .
there is very little competition in this field .
we have to ensure that we have a proposal that will encourage others into this industry and bring greater competition .
the commissioner made a reference and i think that her reference was clear .
i support the call from the rapporteur with regard to an economic impact assessment of this legislation before the second reading .
this is what is important .
given the contribution that this sector makes to the development of the community , a support strategy is the least it can expect .
we are working on this at the moment .
thank you very much commissioner .
the debate is closed .
first it was certain countries , and now it is others .
under what conditions and for what purpose are they being carried out ?
do we have the money in the first place ?
that is something that is very important to us .
the debate is closed .
decision on urgent procedure
i would therefore propose that we accept the request for urgent procedure .
i would like to thank all my colleagues who have been involved in this subject and who will be involved in it in the future .
particularly everyone who took part in the working party in order to find a compromise .
we have voted on these .
that is my position .
unfortunately we were not able to achieve that .
unfortunately we were not able to achieve this .
a further example is the directive 's scope .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we expect a great deal of our environment , often too much .
no , most certainly not !
under no circumstances !
we must not allow this to happen .
what , then , does this commission proposal achieve ?
however , the commission 's proposal does not do this .
this is not acceptable .
mr president , as we know , the environment is ' out ' .
i would then like to make two points : one specific and the other general .
i believe the committee on legal affairs and the internal market has not done this house justice .
this house must make changes .
( applause from the left )
after all , most human activities have some impact on the environment .
that is all i wanted to say to you .
there are , however , two things that i would like to point out .
finally , i would like to come back to nuclear energy .
it is completely unacceptable .
whether that is enough for it to work , i do not know .
i will point out some areas in which we have done that .
it will be the general public .
we cannot allow that to happen .
we must not allow that .
i will focus on two specific points of this important directive .
there is a need for important changes .
what about the scope ?
for international activities , there should be international rules .
this is the only rule that can apply .
this is not acceptable .
the debate is closed .
let it take the place of the instrument , if it must .
the debate is closed .
that is very good , but it has left two fundamental problems .
that is something we find unacceptable .
it comes very close to doing that .
this is something i hope the commission will welcome .
this is common sense .
that is already provided for in our rules of procedure .
that is something that all should welcome .
however , we must of course take a close look at what form the procedures may take in the future .
that is not our point .
we do not believe that this is acceptable .
i believe that the end result will indeed move in this direction .
why are we doing this ?
that too has already been mentioned .
we have to change this .
in this context i have already referred several times to our discussions in the convention .
mr president , allow me to reply to some of the points that have been raised .
i believe that the commissioner is wrong .
the debate is closed .
as you know , this is in everyone 's interest . a great deal remains to be done , however .
if you adopt these measures today , that will be rather less the case .
i think that is clear to everyone .
before the vote on the draft legislative resolution
. i would like to hear from the commission whether it can accept the amendments proposed by parliament .
we cannot accept amendments nos 3 , 10 and 11 ( in part ) .
that would be unacceptable to parliament and i therefore ask for the report to be referred back to committee .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
that is why we voted against the proposal .
these measures must be applied in all the member states .
this is something that we have to change .
what consequences did it have in the end ?
other countries are doing that .
why are we not doing so ?
is that as it should be ?
why is there no clear european line on this point ?
the european union , not only the member states , should be taking action in this regard .
that is not enough , however .
perhaps this is enough at this point .
that might have happened .
that could have happened to us .
what would we have done ?
what should we do about these ?
i also welcome what the minister has said about this .
in any case , we must have guidelines .
why is that ?
the role of the world health organisation is fundamental , which is why cooperation between the who , the european commission and the member states has been effective .
what are we doing now in europe ?
in europe we have an internal market .
i am not one of them .
all these things were held over at the time at that meeting of the council .
what do i see ?
what security can i offer citizens now ?
they are needed more than ever .
unfortunately no other conclusion is possible at the moment .
firstly , and it has been said many times before , there must be joint action .
confidence in the government is important .
mr president , the european union and the member states must now take responsibility .
what are you going to do as a result of this debate ?
in all events , the fact is that there are also cases in europe .
the text in general was the result of compromise .
however , everyone agreed on the need for a common european policy on the issue and on health matters in general .
thank you , mr president-in-office of the council .
the debate is closed .
for me , information policy is of key importance .
this is not just parliament 's role .
the commission and the member states have let us down .
we see no need for that .
this expenditure item is new .
the focus is the right one .
what is so wrong with it ?
but then that is the financial side of the matter .
this way , they will be able to follow them .
the second was necessary institutional reforms .
these reforms are just as important now as they were then .
the third priority was to deal with all these matters within the budgetary framework .
the debate is closed .
at this stage i should like once again to thank all of those who were involved in the negotiations .
this is of course particularly important for the accession countries .
the funds are available for this .
thank you very much !
parliament has the same priority as the commission : to make a success of enlargement .
agriculture : at present , we find little in the commission 's proposals of what the parliament proposed in the guidelines .
it may come later .
they are not being increased very much .
this too is an issue for parliament .
perhaps europe will have to do something about it .
no mention has yet been made of iraq .
what does the commissioner - or what do we - expect to happen there ?
this we shall also have to discuss .
i do not know if it will be the case as soon as next year , but it could be .
!
why , in point of fact , is this cooperation to be only in the field of energy ?
i am sure that we will have discussions on that in parliament as well .
it is not just energy .
that is the first step .
perhaps you could say something further on the subject .
part i
i agree with the honourable member that this is a process .
it is true that this is both part of the problem and part of the solution .
this is what i find most important .
how does it see the future development of these programmes ?
difficult , but all right .
many of them should go back to agricultural activities and this is the key to doing what needs to be done concerning the majority of these people .
have there been any developments ?
i have raised this matter myself in very clear terms .
subject : convention on the future of europe
this is reality .
this is another aspect we have to work on .
on this issue of money , we are doing important things .
our water initiative has the same effect , and we offer real assistance to those governments that face up to this .
thank you very much .
first , i should like to thank the commissioner for her response .
i would like to make a special reference to the people of ireland .
thank you very much , commissioner .
we thank you for your cooperation .
we still have 10 minutes left .
the first question is my question .
what has happened is that the commissioner only had one question to answer .
i believe that the commission is not in a position to deal with this question as such .
three members will take the floor .
mr president , i would like to put a question .
that is how the order is decided .
i understand that was what the money was actually used for .
i have nothing to ask the commissioner . it was an internal point of order .
that is why they are there .
and today is the first time this has happened , and we take very good note of the fact .
thank you .
this is unacceptable .
what i ask you is this : how much longer are things to go on like this ?
is that , i ask you , democracy ? is that freedom of opinion ?
the list could go on and on .
that is not the situation .
what conclusions can we draw from this ?
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the directive is the right place for this rule , and so we cannot support the proposed amendments .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i thank you .
the fact is that we find that unacceptable , and so , above all , do the people that this is all about .
i do not think this is any way for parliament and the council to work together .
obviously it has been difficult to achieve a common position .
i take the same view .
this we have always supported .
i think that it is possible and in the committee on employment and social affairs we have done everything to avoid making this just a debate on a matter of principle .
the council can simply adopt our amendments .
i think that they will have to come back to this at some future time , but the opportunity now is with the council .
this i find quite proper .
this is the case of the future members of our union .
i believe , commissioner , that we share this concern .
i believe that the rapporteur has had a very important role to play in this connection .
the debate is closed .
i think that there should be action to deal with this problem at european level .
this is the situation we must now address .
our question is this : what is the commission doing to achieve this ?
in my view , there are three specific issues .
the first is the environmental impact .
the structural funds must be expressed far more clearly in this regard .
that being so , i am sure that things can be done there .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
situation in iraq
the minister should be here in a few minutes .
safety is still a very real problem for people trying to go to work or return to work in iraq .
they are very different .
allow me now to move on to the item on the agenda relating to iraq .
today , we face a new situation in iraq .
now let me turn to iraq .
( applause )
( applause )
why ?
this is an absolutely essential issue .
have we nothing to say about the extremely serious events that have taken place since then , which have been in total conflict with this line ?
that is not the common foreign policy that my group has in mind .
did you hear anything in that line ?
i did not .
the commissioner did say one important thing , however , with which i fully agree .
finally , if europe is serious about defence and security , it needs to provide the financial resources .
( applause )
what shall we say to our citizens during the european elections in a year 's time ?
what did we do doing the war ?
what did we do after the war ?
that is clear .
some people today have mentioned women 's rights within iraq .
mr president , commissioner , mr president-in-office , first let me say how much i welcome this debate on iraq .
so how do things look now ?
however , there have to be certain principles .
what are they ?
there is no way out of this .
the european union has to address this issue .
we are talking about war and peace .
this experience should now be put to good use in the interests of the people of iraq .
yet this is still not enough .
we share common values .
this is precisely the problem we have in developing a common foreign policy .
i should like to hear what he has to say about this .
i hope that you can give him the opportunity to give me a reply .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament approved the joint text )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
after the vote :
( parliament adopted the resolution )
we will now continue with the vote .
i should like to point out that this is not actually the case .
they are the same .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
president .
i do not think so .
as some of the amendments were a step in the right direction , we voted in favour of this report .
these negotiations are now in their final stage .
in the opinion of the presidency , the negotiations were successful .
thank you very much for being here today .
i therefore think that in principle increased cooperation with the united states is a positive development .
i understand this ; it has been made very clear .
at the same time i can see that the legal systems of the united states and the european union are not the same .
i understand that the council has reached a compromise here too .
i wanted to say to you , mr president , that you have said very little about the criminal court .
the fact that this is not discussed is not , therefore , a problem in itself .
we must support those countries which are coming under pressure .
we do not have this information .
i doubt whether the union will be able still to do so when this treaty is implemented .
is this request also supported by member states ?
i shall try and reply to these concerns .
that is what we want .
thank you , minister .
the debate is closed .
where do we stand at present with this project ?
we should then be in a position to start on the practical work , as soon as we have been given the necessary political green light .
as you have heard , the presidency is working on that and the presidency 's approach has the commission 's full support .
on that particular point i think you are wrong .
this is urgent .
in political terms , the commission communication may be right , but the measures proposed are not .
at this stage , however , four questions come to mind .
how is the european policy going to work in relation to the existing national policies ?
it is made very clear that this is not the case .
each of them has significant political and economic problems .
a new financial instrument must be developed for cooperation .
they are therefore not foreign to europe .
the united states and russia are involved in the region for economic reasons .
that is no way to deal with issues of this kind .
mr president , i welcome the commission communication .
that should be clear .
it is , though , for these countries themselves to decide if that is what they want .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
that was one of the main reasons why we adopted a common strategy with russia in 1999 .
we hope that we will be able to present a joint plan for the common economic area by the end of this year .
we do not see it that way .
i have a question on this point .
i should especially like to hear the council 's assessment of this .
the human rights situation in russia still needs a lot of work .
the iraq war has shown that russia is part of a european area of cooperation .
it is the most recent example of that .
the country must be made a member of the wto as soon as possible , and given a certain role to play in european security cooperation .
i know it will be very difficult to change that .
that is not acceptable .
that is the reality today .
we do not need any new organisations .
i really do hope that the policy adopted by the commission will apply .
i have nothing to say other than to ask the honourable member to put his question to the commission .
it is not a matter for which the council of the european union is responsible .
you clearly heard the council 's response .
gentlemen , although i am going to give you the floor , i would ask that this be the end of the matter .
the president-in-office of the council has given a full , clear answer with regard to the subject of the question .
there are no points of order .
i have nothing to say .
the honourable member is talking about structural problems on the internal market and so on .
in all events , i think that they exist in every country .
i do not know the answer to your question at this moment in time .
i would like to thank the president-in-office for his reply .
i cannot but agree with him that education is crucial to success .
mr president , i would like to thank the president-in-office for his response .
in addition , i should like to point out that the problem is not a technical one .
subject : european rural model
firstly , i want to thank the council for its answer .
the council will keep the situation under close review . '
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
i look forward now to your discussion of the report .
he has adopted at least some points from this parliamentary report .
that does mean , though , an increased risk .
there are a number of important questions .
how are we to deal with this ?
i should like to hear the commissioner 's response to this point .
once again he has done an excellent job .
the first concerns political responsibility .
i should like to hear your answer to both these questions .
it will happen .
but it still has not happened .
i should like to know why .
in that respect the commission did do its work .
at the end of may we shall have a report on the subject .
it is not a public health problem .
this is the second report .
he has shown that .
this , i believe , is necessary in the european union .
it is a matter for the free market .
there will be a report on that issue in due course .
when will it start ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
unfortunately , however , this is the way things are .
it is one of many aspects of the same problem that we are working on .
the debate is closed .
that is a significant and important start .
it is a success for us all .
we support education both through budgetary support and sector funding .
we also included additional policy priorities for our support for education .
this is an issue we have been discussing in our dialogue between the commission and parliament .
there are also too many programmes .
that is now one of the priorities we must address and try to achieve some progress in this specific area .
so what is the situation ?
no !
we have already seen this in europe .
but it is a long road .
that is the key to development .
it is a question of priorities .
mr president , i just want to reply to a few points that have been raised .
the water initiative is one other such case .
this is an important point .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
no ?
no , they cannot .
why ?
what is the commission going to do then ?
in conclusion of this debate , i have received a motion for a resolution
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we have achieved this .
that is what coordination is about .
we fully agree on the need to increase employment .
you asked two questions . firstly , you asked why we do not have a list of structural reforms .
we know what we need to do .
should not all this be enough to put us in a better position than we are in ?
why do we need new economic policy guidelines ?
mr president , i am the rapporteur for the report on the guidelines of the economic policies of the member states .
the idea was for us also to have voted on that report today .
today , the situation is different .
this is the subject of political debate .
i very much welcome this .
i should therefore like to bring two important points to your attention .
first of all , social policy .
the european model is based on solidarity , while the american model is not .
another point : immigration .
let us be clear about this : the rapporteur 's amendments accept and support the guidelines proposed by the commission .
the member states must continue to be responsible for coordination .
the responsibility for economic policy in europe must remain with the individual member states .
i share this view .
i should like to mention a few points .
i agree with the rapporteur that a new approach to economic policy is required , but what new approach ?
we all know that this is actually not the case .
the only question is : how do we achieve it ?
unfortunately , your answer was not specific enough .
i shall return to this point later .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the european central bank has so far done some excellent work .
the debate is closed .
the next item is voting time .
mr president , there is absolutely no reason for this .
i put the matter to the house .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
mr president , i have just two comments to make .
that is all .
this means that everything will carry on just as before .
we also believe that public investment in this field must be increased .
therefore , let us put our own house in order .
not at all !
it will have to do without our support .
we voted against this report .
are there any comments ?
who is making the decisions here ?
( the minutes were approved )
secondly , i should like to know what the content of this draft is , since you have given us , very precisely , during this debate , the opportunity to do so .
in any case , you have already used three minutes .
i therefore believe that we need as much market as possible , as quickly as possible . we need as much transparency as possible as quickly as possible .
what would that mean ?
nothing is clear !
thank you very much , commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
this must stop at all costs .
we are trying to encourage democracy in these countries .
we must act .
i call on the council and the commission to take this step .
the commission , in its assistance programme , is fully involved in these efforts , whether through humanitarian or development funds .
it is essential for all parties to the conflict to protect human rights and to respect international humanitarian law in the areas under their control .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
mr president , the issue now under our consideration is actually both urgent and one of human rights , because no human right is more important than the right to health .
the debate is closed .
it does not take them seriously , in other words .
that is not our responsibility .
that is what this house demands .
the debate is closed .
there is currently no proposal before us regarding a meeting on that date .
thank you .
the following changes have been proposed :
i do not know why this has not been done .
i know members would wish to discuss the issue , even if not to decide on it .
this is a serious matter .
the order of business was thus established .
can we not use your authority to do something about this ?
could we not get something done to improve it ?
we are all agreed that the way forward is through the democratic process .
i hope we can see those elections held very soon .
the debate is closed .
why is it that this house is in this difficult position ?
the fundamental issue is of whether this european community is a real community or an international organisation .
that is what it is about !
( applause )
( applause )
many thanks for that , and many thanks to you all !
( applause )
i would like to congratulate him on his work and , on behalf of the commission , wish him the best possible results .
we hope to be able to achieve this agreement once and for all .
that , though , makes no sense .
what i expect of the council is that it should , as soon as possible - by which i mean before the elections - decide in favour of what parliament demands .
once we have taken our decision tomorrow , the next move will be for the council .
( applause )
mr president , i hope we do not have to come here again to talk about our employment conditions .
i agree with him in the sense that there is a democratic crisis .
with these crucial amendments , the resolution can be carried .
in a year 's time the elections are coming around again .
with all due respect , this does not make any sense .
the principle behind this report is good : equal pay for equal work .
however , i have to ask whether we are all equal .
according to some of the amendments tabled , i do not think we are .
that is what is most important .
that is the right course to follow .
in my opinion , that is very true .
that is a considerable step forward .
can it ?
this fact , however , does not prevent me from making a few comments .
this , therefore , is not acceptable .
i understand that there is cause for debate here , such as the subject of tax , and i believe we could debate this within this house .
that is unacceptable to many members , myself included .
unfortunately , that is not the case .
i hope that the council will respect parliament 's work .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i believe that today 's debate is an important one .
in particular it will stress the need to guarantee the full application of the relevant provisions of community law .
what have we achieved ?
it will also allow society to continue the debate on energy services .
i think this is a good result .
i will see to it that this is done .
this is the way it should be , too .
this seems to me to be another important point for the commission to note .
my group will vote in favour of this tomorrow .
what comes next ? that is the question .
we have not achieved all we want .
environmental protection need not be at risk , nor need access by the public to energy .
that is an important risk and we must draw our attention to that in future work .
it is an important move forward .
we will have a better use of energy in europe because of it .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is all too good to be true .
the energy market is different from other markets .
some members want to force this .
i would say , no , it does not .
i would say that it does .
it is something that we have to change .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , these are the key points of our proposal .
we had three proposed amendments .
the period will be more or less five years so we will go along with that .
we cannot understand why that , as we proposed , was not an acceptable level .
be that as it may .
those are the problems we have to face .
i would like to focus on two points , firstly legislation .
there has been no response from the authorities for some months now .
i think that something like that must also apply here .
this is waste management .
if only they were , commissioner .
in the longer term , i should also like to see the other proposals my group has presented return in the form of a directive .
the commission can present proposals on this .
in this regard , i would like once again to thank the rapporteur .
that is a good result .
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to take up some of the issues raised here today .
but it is one more measure which will allow us to increase safety .
or what other measures is the commission prepared to take ?
the debate is closed .
the european parliament and the report by the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy support this approach by the commission .
are we entirely in agreement then ?
not quite .
i agree with the rapporteur when she says that the european union must also continue to support and promote regional cooperation and integration in the future , therefore .
experience has shown this .
it is true today where cultural matters are concerned , as it is in other areas .
i wish we had more time , but unfortunately we do not .
the debate is closed .
it does not currently have one , however .
we can then reach common agreement , as institutions , on transparency , effective criteria and the implementation of these criteria .
unfortunately the same cannot be said of the council of ministers , which , in this case , has the last word .
this is an area in which it is essential that we do so .
in due course i look forward to legislative proposals from the commission .
once again i thank the rapporteur .
what is going on ?
the debate is closed .
so much for the political issues .
that is a good thing .
in this connection , we note that the commission is making a considerable effort .
i will not , of course , list the points already mentioned by the rapporteur .
i would like to focus on a number of political requirements which go hand in hand with the action programme .
the debate is closed .
guidelines for the employment policies of the member states
we have now reached the final stage in our joint effort to reform the european employment strategy .
firstly , stability .
we have received considerable support from parliament in this respect .
i now turn to the new priorities .
let me now address the views of this parliament .
this is yet another area in which we very much welcome the strong support of the parliament .
our work can have practical results , something which is needed .
firstly , we have proposed increased attention to unemployment .
it is not the last time we shall have that opportunity .
they will then have parliament 's support .
there are quite a few amendments about this .
if we are to come up with views on this , we must express ourselves in very general terms .
in conclusion , i want to say that we have , in general , reached agreement .
employment policy is important on the whole .
we fully agree with this strategy .
the fact that we now have full employment as an objective is particularly important .
another objective is work of good quality .
a third important issue is integration .
that is important .
the fact is , it is not .
that said , we have some concerns .
what they lack is the political will to do it .
i agree particularly on the points he makes about tax , that it is very much a national issue and long may that so remain .
today is a very important day , and i look forward to that meeting going the way i hope it will .
i would also like to thank the commissioner for what he said and for the effort which the commission has made to accept amendments from parliament .
a number of members have made reference to this amendment already .
i hope we can bring it back in as a result of this amendment .
there was a need for this .
we need to focus on the objective : more employment and more jobs in europe .
i should like to call for a number of things .
the first is an action plan against unemployment .
mr president , commissioner , i too would like to thank the commission for its proposal for guidelines and the commissioner for his words .
in this regard , i would like to focus on a number of points .
mr president , the treaty states that there must be guidelines concerning the member states ' employment policy .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i thank the rapporteur for his proposals , which are supported by our group as well .
the debate is closed .
we now need to make an overall assessment of the result of the negotiations .
mr president , this is indeed a significant agreement .
that is the question asked by this report .
i hope you will think again when you come to vote on it in this vote today .
something really has to be done about this .
not yet .
i would like to ask two questions .
why ?
i shall try to make myself clear .
it does not exist .
the debate is closed .
i would also thank the commission for its support , which was particularly welcome .
this proposal for a directive would make it possible to achieve significant progress that we can all support .
for all these reasons , i think that the commission 's proposal is quite positive .
i congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
in any case , that is what we say every morning .
the debate is closed .
i would point out that this case is not specific to france .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
we had a long discussion between the groups yesterday .
( applause )
the services are aware of the problem .
before the vote on amendment no 10 :
i shall therefore vote against it .
mr president , i should also like to congratulate the rapporteur .
we now have a majority .
' .
of course , we did not support it .
' i put the question to the house .
it is important for the european parliament to give its support to this strategy .
we do not share this view .
the same applies to labour market policy .
it is a matter of solidarity .
for this reason , i did not vote for the report .
i think that parliament ?
we have been able to compromise on some matters but there are others of principle on which we will not compromise .
we therefore believe that members of the european parliament should pay national tax in their own countries .
what is the point of these words ?
. the subject of this report is an extremely important one .
i therefore voted against the report .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the eu cannot change this situation by itself but , together with the united states , we should be able to do a lot in this area .
that is where my report on rural development comes in .
what are the commission 's proposals , in fact ?
so why should not we do the same ?
i would like to thank them too for the amendments tabled concerning the report .
what would be the consequences of such a course of action ?
with the committee on agriculture and rural development , then , i have taken another approach .
that is not true .
that is not fair , commissioner .
almost all the member states take a positive position on this measure in principle .
i should like now to refer to the financial aspects of the proposals for the reform of the common agricultural policy .
today we are at a crucial stage in the overall process .
this model is our programme .
the same can be said of the rules for state aid and the regulations of the structural funds .
that is something with which we agree .
mr president , i wish of course to thank everyone for all the work that has been done .
these are the main reasons why we have tabled a number of amendments on behalf of our group , amendments which i hope will be accepted by the house .
what can we say about the lack of information on the impact of your proposals ?
thank you , president-in-office of the council .
the commission should also take such special circumstances as these into consideration .
we should all be clear about this .
these funds should be used in the interests of rural development in each member state .
- the funds remain the same .
reform of eu agricultural aid is therefore more necessary than ever .
this is not always the case in this house .
this is the question i should like to put to the commission .
why ?
i have a question for the council .
does it want reform because of enlargement or because of the wto ?
i have three short questions for the commissioner , which i hope he may be able to answer , if not today then certainly later on .
finally , i will refer to the how and the when of the reform .
it is hard work but an agreement must be reached .
that will not work .
it is not fair .
it will not help however if everyone takes their region out and says that nothing should be done here and nothing should be done there .
we must look into that .
( applause )
farmers need a clear direction as to where they are going .
we need a decision from the council of ministers so that farmers can plan for the future .
it will also help us face up to enlargement .
the debate is closed .
part i
part 2
. ( de ) mr president , the honourable member is quite right , of course : we will never have enough money to do everything .
that is one point .
. the honourable member is right .
therefore , this new article , if included at last in the final treaty , would also provide the response to the previous questions .
in these cases , however , it is the ministers who speak and not the commission .
thank you for your reply , commissioner .
thank you very much for your cooperation , commissioner .
what we are trying to do is to present it as quickly as possible .
all i need say to you is that we received it about 10 days ago .
there are legal procedures , but there are also internal committee procedures .
i think that the best practice model would be appropriate here too .
they are consumers .
yet this is no longer provided for in the convention 's draft .
as you know , there is an agreement on the free movement of workers during the first two years .
the issue of human rights is one of our main concerns .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , is this the place , is this the time ?
( applause )
we have also discussed this proposal with the council of ministers .
this is the objective of the proposal we are discussing today .
however , as part of the overall compromise , the commission can agree to both amendments .
however , relevant amendments from the first reading did not make it to this second reading either .
mr president , commissioner , i am very pleased that it has been possible to achieve a common position between the council , the commission and parliament here .
i welcome that .
it is an excellent step forward .
i welcome this report because it will show us a way forward .
this regulation is a great success .
everything has already been said , but not yet by everyone .
i think that is absolutely crucial .
the common position is also a great success .
the debate is closed .
we will consider parliament 's amendments with the same objective in mind .
the other reason why we want to go so far is public health .
this aspect should also be taken into consideration .
we need to agree on the level of reduction we must achieve .
it is supported - as you see - by a large majority in this house .
it is not our job to decide how this should be done .
the cost issue was naturally a major consideration in the committee on industry .
that is how we must work together .
our group will also vote against them because we do not think it is possible to implement them .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the committee on fisheries :
i hope that parliament will support all of the amendments tomorrow .
i hope that the commission too will accept that there is a need to change the way things are done , and done for the better .
let us be quite clear about this .
we cannot allow this to happen .
this was the case during the many years when the common agricultural policy was being developed and it is the case now as well with regard to the common fisheries policy .
one last point , on the subject of women .
you said there is little interest because the proposal is so technical .
as we have seen in recent months , that is really not the case .
there is a reason for this .
i have already tabled amendments to this effect in the past .
mr president , first of all on the technical measures .
we would like to see our amendment supported tomorrow during the vote .
it is not a political one .
we must ask why .
they are two principles which the commission must accept .
this must be made absolutely clear .
far from it .
this is completely unacceptable .
for this very reason , i wish to support the rapporteur and to call on all members to vote for amendment no 20 of this report tomorrow .
they are allowed in there at the moment .
there is only one commission proposal .
there is also the report on the proposal , and my statement .
there is no going back .
however , no other member state has provided any data as yet .
thank you commissioner .
the joint debate is closed .
however , we do this for very different reasons .
welcome
that is why the issues of the convention on the future of europe are major issues for the council and the union in general .
as you know , ladies and gentlemen , this debate is under way .
considerable progress has been made .
today we already have the union 's foreign minister as a practical example to work with .
( applause )
nevertheless , we need to make still further progress .
( applause )
the same should apply to home affairs .
in conclusion i would like to make a comment about foreign policy , which will have a major role to play .
if you take this decision , you will have my group 's support .
( applause )
the central issue in this debate is the future of europe , and it is within this framework that the convention is working .
this is an absolutely fundamental point .
firstly , the question of the commission .
one is the economy .
this is also of importance in terms of our future relations .
what do we want to do together ?
what do we really want ?
this has become only too clear since the war against iraq .
for the most part , we share the fundamental reason why the convention was first established .
why ?
we need to free ourselves of you , and we shall !
we hope that this will happen , so that everyone can benefit .
health , for example , is one such policy .
i hope that the union will decide to give consideration to this and that the next presidency of the union will put forward proposals in this respect .
we do not want that kind of europe .
we believe that all the member states should have a commissioner .
the president of the commission is absolutely right .
mr president , i want to talk about two matters on the summit agenda .
i hope we will look at that soon .
this conclusion is in itself nothing new .
this approach has - as we have said here many times - been a success .
this - and i say this direct to the council - this needs money .
it will place great demands on their citizens .
that is why i believe that these countries should first put their own house in order before they start making further demands on us .
the money is available ; we do not need to create new funding .
( applause )
but we also need to help these countries carry out their economic reforms .
what does that mean ?
this is not something that you can say is open .
we have made progress , but in which direction ?
these institutional questions are all very important , but in my view must really only come into play when we have reached agreement on the content of european policy areas .
europe must become important for its citizens .
institutional questions are very important , but first we must give europe back to its citizens .
the criteria for the future treaty of the european union should not be large or small nor old or new .
to do so , we need to share : share within the union , share with the new member states , share with developing countries .
i would like to mention a few issues regarding foreign policy in the convention .
it goes without saying that we wish to use our foreign policy to promote human rights , democracy and environmental protection .
there are some things in this field that should not be allowed to happen again .
however , that can only be a first step in this debate .
these are important and vital decisions in which parliament , too , should be involved .
now , what is parliament 's role in all this ?
these are two essential , but different , objectives .
in the same way , all essential aspects of economic policy must remain the responsibility of the member states .
mr president , the convention has made progress in many issues of political content .
public support is absolutely essential for the future of the eu .
one eu priority this term has been food safety .
efforts must be made .
we are an area which , for the last two or three years , has a single currency .
they have given us , all working together , a single framework of what they want for the europe of the future .
thank you , mr president of the commission .
mr president , i fully agree with your decision , under these circumstances , to refer the request to the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
every time parliament takes a position , we ask the commission to give it serious consideration .
that is why .
( applause )
the proposal is that this should be referred back to committee .
this would be an important step forward for parliament , which the commission would very much welcome .
so there !
its support for the parliament 's position is welcome .
that is not the case at all .
we all want the reform .
( applause )
i would ask , for a quite specific reason , to take the floor under the rules of procedure .
that is what i should like to propose .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote :
. mr president , i know about the honourable member 's concern on this matter and i know what has been said in the past .
thank you for that , rapporteur !
i do not want to open a general debate at this point .
that is what support for amendment 20 would mean .
( applause )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
president .
with this in mind , i support the rapporteur when he :
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
this issue is going to go on and on .
i have therefore voted against the report once again .
i hope that it will be possible to implement this in the member states in a practical way so that consumers really are given this opportunity .
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
about time !
the council must also take account of this proposal in its negotiations for a compromise .
in the end , however , it was not necessary to vote for them .
that must be our first priority .
if it is not wanted as an addition , we shall vote against .
a new government has taken over power , with strong support from the people .
turkey has a key role to play here .
its aim is to support turkey in meeting the accession criteria .
( applause )
i do not know how long this will last .
( applause )
it comes down above all to its application in practice .
why not ?
a clear stand should have been taken on this issue .
the eu is a political and economic union .
in turkey at the moment , this is unfortunately not the case .
it was in fact done in committee .
we are very good at this and we must carry on with it above all .
finally , mr president , we will all have to answer the question of whether we want it to be successful .
this position on my part is based on the following reasons :
on all these points , i believe one can only agree with the rapporteur .
it is a long list , and one that turkey must work through .
many of you simply do not want turkey .
i am pleased at the comments from the commissioner .
the president-in-office of the council said there are two priority areas .
obviously , when the moment comes , everyone will be able to take their own decisions .
so far , however , it is precisely this that we have yet to see .
the debate is closed .
the union has made it absolutely clear that it is dealing with relations with the united states as the main priority for its foreign policy .
working together , we can help create a better world for everyone .
this is an important debate .
the role of the european parliament will be essential in this regard .
we now have the euro .
first , there is the question of iraq .
however , i will not give up on that particular point .
that is the important point .
first , france and germany are not the european union .
they certainly do not speak for europe .
the debate is closed .
i would like to say one other thing .
i would like to mention a few conclusions .
i am in total agreement with the commissioner on this point .
it is an effective instrument to promote peace , stability and democracy .
it was , and still is , their task .
mr president , i agree with what you say about the rules of procedure .
that is why i put the question .
decisions have been taken one step at a time over recent months , as they were during the previous presidency .
this is a new policy area for the union .
that is clear , but this question has been allowed .
thank you , mr president .
however , a great deal still needs to be done .
trade and business need a framework , however .
these are commission issues .
i would ask the honourable member to put this question to the commission .
this is why a line should be made available here , and this is certainly something that is also in the interests of the council .
mr president-in-office of the council , i therefore have some very specific questions for you .
we therefore need to ask the question again .
i have nothing to add to what i have said .
the criteria and procedures are provided for and are clear .
the council will keep the situation under close review . '
i have nothing further to add .
i have taken note of the honourable member 's proposal and we shall see if this can be done .
i thank you , mr president-in-office of the council .
mr president , to start with , this is not a question to which i shall reply .
enlargement issues ;
the commission has not yet done this .
thanks to the president-in-office for that answer , and indeed for the support of his own government in respect of this point .
efforts have been made to bring forward this idea .
this is what i would like to know .
thank you very much .
the council will take account of this report and will decide what it is going to do on the basis of it .
president .
the next item is the joint debate on :
we have thus seen that some progress has been made in the convention , that we have achieved what we wanted to some extent .
this cannot continue .
that is necessary for the process to have democratic authority .
what is most important , however , is that open coordination should become a community process .
they have been based on agreements by the council of ministers .
in future , this procedure will certainly play an important role .
moreover , it is not only the council that is content with this ; the commission too , unfortunately , is very pleased about it .
this is simply unacceptable , and we must fight against it .
i ask that this be taken into account and thank all those who were involved .
if we consider the question of the guidelines which we discussed this week , we see the difficulties and problems that were created , simply because we were not given the information in time .
i believe it to be important for two reasons .
then what ?
a change is therefore to be made to the treaty .
it is really very welcome !
the first question people asked me at home was ' and what role does parliament play in it ?
what rules should we put in place ?
so far , so good .
we in the european parliament often see ourselves being put under pressure of time .
and to date it has not been democratic ; it has been intergovernmental .
this is why it is up to us to do something about it .
madam president , i cannot support the report as a matter of principle .
but that is a very small point .
these , of course , are more difficult to achieve at present .
the discussion is not , however , about the ' how ' but more about the basic ' aim ' of the proposal .
i agree with that .
why , though ?
it certainly is !
that is how it has been presented .
that now applies to the commission as well .
what is the reality in europe ?
that is the problem .
the debate is closed .
i wanted to stress this point .
this is the way forward .
we are only too aware of the consequences this has on women 's health .
there are also a number of other matters whose importance i now wish to stress , having been given the floor .
quite a lot has happened .
perhaps she was better than some of them .
where there is a will , there is a way .
the debate is closed .
we know that the commission is on our side .
same problem .
let there be rather more attention given to them too in the new programmes .
this is a good start , but we know there is always more that can be done .
all the members of my group regard the report , as such , as being of high quality .
i think that that is very important .
this view i share entirely .
why is this so ?
there must be reasons for this that we can find .
mr president , i think it extremely important that we should continue with what the commissioner has proposed .
that must make us think .
there are discussions about this .
there are , however , a number of points which give cause for concern .
both a real political will and practical measures to improve this situation do exist , however .
we must therefore act at different levels :
finally , i would point out that today 's debate cannot be closed .
one last point which i want to stress is the importance of research .
the debate is closed .
first , it is based on scientific data .
in other words , it concerns both the business and the public authorities .
mr president , i wish to thank the general rapporteur and the lead committee for their work on this important proposal .
that is a clear and good principle .
i will just mention the few points that i see as most important .
i therefore support amendments nos 11 and 12 by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
who should be responsible for it ?
should it be at community level or national level ?
there is still much to be done to protect consumer safety throughout the european union and in the enlargement countries .
this report will take us in that direction and it is very welcome .
mr president , i wish to begin with a point of order .
i agree with almost everything he says .
the consumer demands it , public safety requires it .
after all , you cannot see everything on the outside .
we need food safety .
this is something that we are all aware of , and that we support .
thank you , mr president .
thank you very much , commissioner .
i thank you for giving me the opportunity to say this .
do you wish to speak in favour of the proposal ?
mr president , on this point i do not mind what we do .
thank you , commissioner .
mr president , i have just two points , which are however important because they are questions of principle .
it is his decision alone , and there are extremely important reasons for this .
according to the rules of procedure , this decision is his alone , but in this case he has not taken on that responsibility .
( applause )
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
after the vote :
we have yet to see this document .
there is no new commission proposal .
before the vote on the legislative resolution :
four amendments have been voted which are in addition to what the committee voted .
can i ask you to follow the same procedure ?
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
joint motion for a resolution
mr president , i would like to make it clear that , if this is an addition , my group will agree to it .
we shall thus vote on amendment no 11 as an addition .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
joint motion for a resolution
i certainly do not wish to be difficult .
that is all the president did - apply the existing rules .
we need to finally get through to these people !
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
we see the need for reform , and the need for reform for our farmers .
what do we have now ?
europe 's farmers must be given a clear direction for the future .
we , and european farmers , wish him every success !
rural development cannot exist without farmers and agricultural production .
this proposal for a regulation is unacceptable .
this is why i cannot accept the proposals that have been put to us .
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
so who can understand parliament 's vote in favour of it today ?
for our part , we shall continue to support all initiatives of this type .
this week the european parliament is voting on two reports by the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities .
there is a lot of work to be done .
mr president , i am in something of a crisis as far as the rules of procedure are concerned .
are there any comments ?
thank you .
mr president , respect for community law is a fundamental part of the future of europe .
that has already been mentioned too .
the debate is closed .
a political solution now needs to be found quickly .
unfortunately these continue at present .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
it is of crucial importance .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the situation is very much more serious at the moment .
we need to make our position absolutely clear here , and so , too , must the commission .
there has been no other country about which we have accepted so many resolutions with so little effect .
we must know what we want once and for all .
this will not help us at all .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
( before the vote )
we would then vote in favour of them .
parliament has now called for action , with this majority support .
that was the last item on the agenda .
that is why i have voted against the report .
these programmes should be required to meet certain quality standards .
without doubt both !
having the treaty agreed well before the next european elections is essential .
the convention has given its lead .
what is new about it ?
i would like to mention just six points which i think are especially important .
we have created the position of a european minister for foreign affairs .
let us , here in the european parliament , clear the way for this process and make sure that the governments face up to their european responsibility .
it is better than what we have at present , for europe has never been developed in a single step .
( applause )
i believe that a europe of citizens has also been created .
we have more scope for action .
( applause )
i believe that parliament has done significant work .
there is still work to be done .
he said that the european union is not a global power , but that it does have a global power 's responsibility .
the convention still has to meet and debate .
we want europe to work better , but we do not think this is the way to go about it .
i am not sure this has happened .
what do i expect from governments , then ?
i expect them to take this responsibility to their citizens seriously as a basis for their work .
( applause from the right )
that is true , but it does more than that .
i would like there to be further debate on this .
there is absolutely no reason for them not to do so .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i will end this first speech here .
i believe i have left nothing out , but if i have , i am sure that everything will become clear when i reply to your questions .
further progress is needed .
without their political will and commitment nothing will change .
we can point to some progress .
this is not a new point for us .
so this is not an issue to which the european union has come recently .
if the union takes a united stand , we can play a key role .
without the balance of nations , there will be no peace .
we must not set them off along that road .
we must not encourage it .
at last !
we need it .
we want to be free in the law and in freedom .
here too , there are clear demands on everyone involved in this process .
they can only do it by agreement and by sitting down to reach that agreement .
it has the political resources to act .
the commissioner cannot establish it as the main priority .
the eu must encourage and back him in this as well .
it is as much an american plan as a european one .
the debate is closed .
i could go on - but the point is clear .
i think the point is clear .
i believe that we have to answer these questions .
in my view , this is the wrong approach .
we hope that the eu strategy will be clear about the role of the military instrument .
that is in the interests of both the eu and the united states .
no , no one takes us seriously !
no .
let us take another example .
i will end with a comment on terrorism .
it will not be the first strategy , or first draft of a strategy , to be presented , and it will certainly not be the last .
i hope that they will follow this example .
furthermore , most of the victims are women and children .
it is a key sector for the developing countries .
i will come back to this .
we have projects concerning it .
the first answer is development .
this is precisely why trade policy is so important .
madam president , thank you commissioner for being here with us today and for the statement you have made .
in practice , this will allow access to the market .
i wish you every success in the negotiations , commissioner .
we would therefore like to focus on a number of points mentioned by the commissioner .
perhaps , commissioner , there is one thing that i should point out .
i shall refer , by way of example , to four areas of action .
we will have to come back to it later .
that used to be true at national level .
it has become true at european level .
the debate is closed .
given the number of amendments tabled , we should discuss the matter again in committee .
they are difficult for us to accept .
to be able to do this they must have resources .
the draft now before you is something we regard as an acceptable compromise .
the parties will of course be very important in this regard .
tomorrow , we can vote in favour .
i hope that we will .
we will then have taken an important step for political work at eu level , and thus also for european democracy .
that is why we welcome it .
i am , myself , in favour of them .
it is for that reason that i support the text of the regulation .
those who are to use the money can themselves decide how much they want .
it is quite simply a question of whether parties are to be supported by public funds or by members of the individual parties .
for what is a european party ?
i can tell you now that they will not be able to .
it is not clear why .
is that democracy ?
do you know them ?
it is not parliament and it is not the commission .
furthermore , we have only just reached the stage of dealing with their funding ?
it is not up to the commission or the council or the european parliament whether or not we are to have european parties .
it is , moreover , up to the people of europe whether we are to have european parties .
in my view , it is the other way around .
the debate is closed .
no new financial resources are proposed .
i do not have time to discuss further specific proposals and comments .
energy has a role in education .
this is the first , but not the last .
this is because it is a key aspect of sustainable development .
very often these companies are european .
financial support is therefore needed .
the commissioner referred to this today .
we therefore welcome this initiative to work together with developing countries regarding energy .
these are two quite different issues .
money may be private or public .
what is actually needed however are funds and resources .
such then is the nature of the public sector in those countries .
mr president , i would just like to add a word to the same effect .
that is what happened in the committee on development and cooperation .
i mentioned just now the general agreement on trade in services , for example .
i want it to continue .
thank you for the debate .
the debate is closed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , these are the main points .
i shall now comment on some of the proposed amendments .
in our opinion this is not the case .
like the council , we want to reach an agreement in this stage of the legislative procedure but , i hope you understand , not at any price .
that is not something in conflict with the objectives of the directive .
the common position is , in fact , quite a significant step forward but it does not deal with all the problems .
finally , on safety reports and some of the technical issues , i would ask the commission to think again .
authorities were only aware up to a point .
safety is not only a matter of rules , but also of culture .
the debate is closed .
it certainly is not the best time to do so .
all these activities can have very serious consequences .
a further two reports were adopted in the committee on the environment this week .
but over the last year there have been a number of developments which actually cause me and many others to doubt the commitment of the commission .
however , i cannot give you a clear reply to that .
i have taken note of everything you have said .
the debate is closed .
this case is no different .
let me now turn , though , to the specific aspects that have concerned us in the course of second reading .
is it in the interests of the environment ?
this is certainly necessary .
the debate is closed .
the action plan presented by the european commission is necessary .
their experience is vital .
finally , i would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done .
i should also like to congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent quality of his work .
quite right .
that is why it is necessary to take action .
who is right ?
all these efforts must be taken into account .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
it will mean quite large changes in europe , and it will mean a lot for public health .
at this stage , however , i do not want to labour the point .
this really is a good day for european democracy .
there can be no european democracy without european political parties .
( applause )
mr president , i shall not take up much of the house 's time .
access to energy is not part of any human rights convention .
i therefore voted in favour .
all this had already been mentioned in previous reports .
we therefore voted against the motion .
there is nothing new here , just a way of giving financial resources to certain measures that have already been adopted , including :
finally , it is no longer a question of european political parties , but rather of political parties at european level .
i therefore voted against the report .
who is to decide how these criteria are to be applied ?
why ?
we agree in general with the objectives of this report .
for these reasons , i voted against the resolution .
democracy .
relations .
the following changes have been proposed
mr president , as you will be aware , the relevant rule states that there will be a debate and vote .
as i understand it , the request was for a vote on the resolution , not a debate .
i hope , mr president , that you will act on my request .
as you know , mr president , this is against the rules .
they wanted to work in europe .
that is a long time .
we have a cooperation agreement with that country .
parliament will thus have the opportunity to express itself in a vote on a resolution .
we will then follow up on the basis of that particular debate .
mr president , i hope i will not use up all these five minutes .
mr president , i agree with the opinion of the rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
that , however , is not what this was about .
this is the approach which has been taken by the committee on legal affairs and by this report .
the debate is closed .
rapporteur .
mr president , as a member of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , i fully agree , of course , with what the rapporteur has just said .
the debate is closed .
we know that this directive is an important part of the financial services action plan .
what is today 's debate about ?
what does the directive aim at ?
that is what we need .
this may well continue to be a live issue .
i believe that is a great success .
i look forward therefore to our discussion on the transparency directive , which , as you now know , has been given to the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
the committee 's report allowed for no such thing , but the compromise does .
that , mr president , is why i believe that we should all vote in favour of these amendments and adopt the proposed compromise .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on public markets :
and
this principle is the basis for the rapporteur 's proposals .
my aim is to ensure effective competition at european level .
that is why the commission cannot accept those amendments .
it will be of great benefit to the european economy as a whole .
i question whether that is a good thing for this house or for europe .
with this i believe we can all agree .
it was not just our view , but parliament 's view at first reading .
then we have the common position .
let us go forward , colleagues !
what can this parliament expect from a rapporteur at second reading ?
this obviously also applies to the governments of the member states .
why are they not included ?
we must move forward in other areas as well .
i agree with you on that .
water is a public good .
it is also important that the quality should be good .
no !
who would not be ?
very well , then .
therefore we need clear criteria on this in the directive .
that is the only thing we need .
it will be because the public sector takes more responsibility .
my europe is a europe of citizens .
this would , to a large extent , be allowed on the basis of the current proposals .
. mr president , thank you for giving me the floor a second time on this important matter .
i would like to reply to some of the points raised .
there is no doubt about that .
the debate is closed .
we said then that we had five main priorities .
we shall now have economic policy guidelines for three years and this is , i believe , important so that we can plan better .
a second point was the new employment strategy .
what was the problem ?
what does the agreement mean to farmers ?
finally , i should like to move from political issues to defence and security policy .
to close , i should like to refer to two issues relating to community institutions .
and we had your direct support and cooperation in our work .
we need better coordination of national measures at community level as well .
we must achieve this , again within the framework of the debate on rights which we mentioned just now .
unfortunately , however , your presidency has not just been a presidency of high points .
the second point concerns the convention .
a further point is the convention .
mr president , i have a problem .
finally , a comment on external relations .
what , then , does this document say ?
on what basis , however , are we to be united , and for what purpose ?
we were put under pressure by governments .
the convention does not need to make technical decisions here ; it needs to achieve fundamental reforms .
i doubt it .
i hope that means that they will be given the same voting rights as member states .
was it brought up and , if so , what was said ?
i hope that will not be the case .
very well , but which budgets are going to pay for them ?
what will we use them for ?
and what community of values ?
and , finally , what values ?
that is very good .
i do not understand .
it should have the right to do so , and governments should not prevent it from doing so .
you have made some reform progress but not enough .
i agree with him .
it is important that progress be made on that .
with regard to the convention , i should like , mr president , to say two things to you .
when and how shall we be discussing these issues ?
therefore the situation is not the same .
that is a long way from being a good basis on which to work .
it was all right , but today we need something more , and something better , and , what is more , that is in the interests of the intergovernmental conference itself .
i am sure , mr president , that i will have your agreement on this point .
for that reason , i too should like to congratulate the presidency of the council .
all of us are europe !
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , mr president of the commission , i should like to focus on just one point in your debate today .
the paper tabled here is the beginning of a joint reply of this kind .
a good compromise , a good basis for further discussions , which will take place at the intergovernmental conference .
of course it was discussed .
that is not what it is about .
the common programmes help those countries or the areas in which there is a problem , or those countries which have some special need to address the overall problem .
why , what did we want to do ?
we need to create .
secondly , solidarity between member states .
there you are : these are the comments i wanted to make .
? ?
? ?
? ?
? ?
? ?
? ?
? ?
? ?
' .
thank you , mr president-in-office .
( applause )
it is all the institutions together that give life to the european union .
it is obviously an issue that is not going to go away .
are there any comments ?
( the minutes were approved )
there was no majority in favour of this .
it is now important to draw the discussions to a close .
we are not making policy to order here .
it is also on this basis that we shall vote .
what is quite clear is that the european parliament 's proposals will improve these legislative proposals .
our group would like , however , to go still further .
the rules need to be implemented in the member states .
only then do we think that a start can be made on the debate .
i would therefore ask you , commissioner , to give your views on this once more .
this is too much !
what should we do ?
certainly we should continue with the research .
i can give you a list .
i could go on ; the list is a long one .
what does this mean ?
yet the real question , madam president , is not a scientific one concerning health or the environment .
i have one question for the commission .
there already is .
we did not do so .
this means that we now have to ensure that we put a legal framework in place .
we are trying to ensure that this is the case .
what are we going to do in europe ?
what we have agreed in parliament , in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , does not go far enough .
madam president , tomorrow , i will be voting in favour of both reports .
the only problem is that it will not work like that .
i am therefore going to vote tomorrow in favour of the amendments by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
perhaps that is the case .
we do this work because we believe it is right .
this is not the situation .
this is a fact .
we are trying to do our part and to take our responsibility .
that is the main point for me .
this is how we do it .
i ask you to speak and account for this .
i had reasons for saying what i said earlier .
the debate is closed .
i support the compromise .
there is only so much we can achieve at european level .
we will of course return to this in second reading .
i believe that this is a crucial point .
there , we have a directive that was adopted by parliament some time ago , and that framework is in place .
in that area , there has been some progress in recent years .
the issue is still being discussed in the wto context on the one hand .
part i .
subject : reform of the common fisheries policy and the stability principle
thank you for your response , commissioner .
this is a political problem which the commissioner and the union have to face .
we would then have a solution that would , i believe , be acceptable to everyone .
the main side here is as criminal as the production side .
in this context , can it say what the state of economic relations between the union and these two countries is ?
let us look first at the state of the negotiations .
we shall continue to support this course of action at economic , social and political levels .
how can we improve the situation ?
in order to ensure this , we simply have to reduce food aid in kind and increase financial aid for food , in line , furthermore , with the regulations of the various united nations food programmes .
you are quite right .
our strategy remains the same .
mr president , the commissioner 's commitment on this issue is not in doubt at all .
we must respect that commitment .
commissioner , thank you very much for your answer .
i cannot say more than this .
i have , however , a question for those of you responsible for the internal market .
i would like to thank the commissioner for that information .
does the commissioner have this information on him now ?
therefore , in the light of the need to protect animal health and for other reasons it seems necessary to come forward with that particular proposal .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the council and the commission must accept parliament 's view of this problem .
having said this , i will move on to my own report .
it also takes into account most of the other parliament amendments on three important points .
it is , therefore , not acceptable .
i very much welcome the progress made .
parliament supported this .
that is the solution that this house adopted at first reading .
i think it is only right to show solidarity with them .
my group will support all three of these reports .
i would like to thank my colleagues for their excellent work .
this is where there could well be a reduction in the amount of information provided .
would the commission like to say anything more ?
i believe the amendment no 4 compromise is quite clear .
one final response , perhaps , commissioner ?
the debate is closed .
at this point i would also like to direct a word of thanks to the industry .
this is an important part of the directive .
the discussion was indeed more of a discussion between countries than between political groups .
that is why we need clear objectives now .
they must themselves be involved with this .
in this way sustainable development is something that concerns all of us .
i would like to draw your attention to two further points .
i have a question for the commission about this .
there are two points on which i would like a clear statement from the commission .
commissioner , what is your opinion on this ?
this also applies to the accession states .
this is a major problem for countries like ireland that have not done anything about their waste problem .
how right that is !
that is not what all this is about !
i would ask you to support that .
culture change takes time .
nevertheless , we need time and we will do the job .
commissioner , i have a question for you about this .
it is not a question of having done nothing alone .
there will be another time for that .
among those we will be voting on tomorrow , there is one amendment that i regard as particularly important .
. mr president , i will make only four short comments .
we are taking action and we will continue to do so .
unfortunately she has left now , but she asked ' is this out of date ?
we will therefore have to come back to this .
thank you very much , commissioner
the debate is closed .
it has the support of all member states .
on that , commissioner , i am again in agreement with you .
you must see to it that they all play their part .
not all of the amendments have received an equal amount of attention in the negotiations with the council .
that too is an important point for us .
we must not let that happen to european industry .
there are many questions the directive does not answer .
i will mention some of them .
many members , however , will vote in favour of the compromise amendments , because they are better than parliament 's report .
this is a very important directive , perhaps the most important one of these five years , and tomorrow it will be brought to a successful conclusion .
how will this impact on our business ?
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this directive is taking us down a new road .
i will mention just three of them .
mr president , commissioner , the vital importance of this directive in environmental and economic terms is clear .
may it continue to do so .
that of course is our real problem .
that is also why it is important that we take the initiative and try this out .
i shall just comment on two things that were mentioned .
we will also come back on these issues .
of course we will also have to look at what it is possible to do regarding air transport .
however , we will do our best to also address air transport .
thank you very much for that additional information .
the debate is closed .
what is your response to this ?
that does not mean that there is no other country concerned with this issue .
that is long enough .
thank you very much , commissioner .
i therefore ask you all to respect your speaking times .
first of all we have agriculture .
what are the financial consequences of this rate ?
we want to make a start on this .
something has to be done about that .
we should like to have this information from the commission .
another important point for this budget : we want to promote economic development in the new member states .
it is in all our interests , and especially of course in the interests of the new member states , that the work is done and that it is done well .
the question is what that could mean for the budget in the long term .
who can help ?
the commission or the council perhaps ?
that is hard to understand .
we hope , however , that it will soon be a thing of the past .
that would be a good development and i hope we shall see it .
now to the individual points .
in this matter , we want to continue as before .
this is an excellent reform .
that is not the case .
the debate is closed .
there are a whole lot of different problems .
what most concern us , however , are the structural measures .
where this is concerned , something new needs to happen .
it is a fundamental reform .
we had a special situation with humanitarian aid .
i hope we will find agreement on that , too , because it is essential that aid be provided really quickly here .
the debate is closed .
thank you very much for your attention .
the debate is closed .
a great europe needs great institutions .
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
i was very pleased that your own comments and those of the commission president were in agreement .
( applause from the right )
unfortunately i do not have as much speaking time as the president of the european council and the president of the commission .
we do not want that to happen .
( applause from the right )
( applause from the left )
( applause from the left )
the convention has taken place .
( applause from the left )
finally , mr president , i will refer to foreign policy .
( applause )
but the future of europe is up to the member states .
( applause from the left )
( applause from the left )
( applause from the right )
what does it say ?
this is quite clear .
that is not all .
we shall also add training , research and the environment .
does the presidency really mean to promote a european initiative in the economic and social field ?
i wish you success in your work , mr president-in-office !
this , mr president-in-office , is not europe .
this development requires not only trade measures , but also respect for the environment and development opportunities for those countries .
peace in the regions in europe is also important .
this is also the case in some of our own regions .
( applause )
here , as president-in-office of the council , you will not have it .
for example , there is your position about turkey 's accession to the european union .
but what does it really mean in practice ?
why should that be ?
( applause )
( applause )
i have had nothing .
that will not happen in this house .
we are therefore in favour of the european union taking initiatives in the area of growth .
i wish you success in your work !
we do not need it .
i wish you every success in your work , mr president-in-office !
however , in terms of what we must do now , the most important issue that you must address is the intergovernmental conference .
i wish you success , as this will be the success of europe !
i wish the president success .
thank you very much !
there is no doubt that you will carry them both through .
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
( applause from the right )
why ?
you have made a proposal .
( applause )
i do not want to open up a whole debate .
mr president , thank you for giving me the floor .
there are many colleagues who wish to make points of order and to speak .
these are the guidelines for the coming six months .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
mr president , i hope you will hear me out .
that is why we voted against it .
these are the reasons why i voted in favour of the report .
for these reasons , we voted against this proposal .
for these reasons we voted against this proposal as well .
then we will really see whether these products are accepted , because the markets will decide .
no , the problem for industry will be the market , because the market will decide , and the market is made up of individual consumers .
i respect their work .
i have voted along with my group for these two reasons .
we regard it as a good instrument .
we feel that this is not the right approach .
the rapporteur 's excellent work has made a significant contribution to this process .
there must be no doubt about this .
that is what happened the first time .
without outside help it will take even longer to put things right .
as far as the humanitarian situation is concerned , i can fully support what the commissioner has said .
something must be done about what the humanitarian organisations are going through over there .
the debate is closed .
there is still therefore much to be done .
firstly , agriculture .
this objective remains one of the union 's priorities .
we will therefore have to reach agreement on the rules .
we will do so with you .
over the past three months , we have not seen a great deal of progress in the wto negotiations .
firstly , on agriculture .
final set of questions .
the environment and health are more important than the wto rules .
let me ask you a few questions .
what should the eu do in those circumstances ?
if we do , there will be a price to pay in other negotiations !
these include the service sector among many others .
so far , no progress has been made .
this is precisely the quality that europe can add to a new world trade agreement .
i hope that this parliament will be united behind the commission .
we must move towards what some of the developing countries want .
it is in their interest and also in our interest .
you are right .
we are working on this .
i will deal with two or three more questions .
parliament took a position on it , so i am not going to come back to the subject .
you know that we support your efforts in this area .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
what does this position mean ?
so how can we put forward our position ?
they stress the need to take into account the union 's position .
what are the results ?
this is why it goes without saying that the three major institutions within the european union should stand united behind this same line .
we should be able to do more and i hope we will be able to do so .
however , those countries will have to deal with the consequences of those negotiations .
i thank the mr president-in-office .
his reply is very positive .
there are two things i would like to ask the council .
subject : human rights in russia
i should like to thank the president-in-office for the positive reply to my question .
it is making progress again .
secondly , i would put to him that there is a major interest in the accession countries .
i would thank you very much for your answer .
if the council is aware of this , what will it be doing about it ?
subject : victims of the war in iraq
so there were other reasons .
subject : objective 1 regions and the structural and cohesion funds
the council presidency will only be able to take action following the report .
the next item is the joint debate on
finally , i should like to thank my colleagues for their great cooperation throughout the process .
so how do matters stand ?
why is this so ?
how are these to become reality ?
i will come back to this .
i think that it is a process .
where there is a will , there is always a way .
at present , there are still some points to deal with .
that is what it is about .
allow me to mention three points which i believe are fundamental in this connection .
that is not our job .
we simply cannot do that , ladies and gentlemen .
that is another issue .
i am sure of this , ladies and gentlemen , but this is the first step .
the debate is closed .
what europe needs is a sustainable solution to its transport problems .
( applause )
that will not help matters at all .
i think that , all things considered , parliament is going a long way in the right direction .
i wanted to say this , not because the commission , from this point of view , is not well aware of all this , but because it seems that at times the council was not .
it is just not on !
that is all .
the debate is closed .
that is no longer acceptable , however .
i hope colleagues will support amendment no 2 .
will you , commissioner , support amendment no 2 ?
commissioner , will you support that amendment ?
i would like to know whether we are really certain of that .
i would like once again to express my thanks for the work done .
we were able to achieve today 's result in a little over two months .
i should like to express my thanks for this .
road safety is important to the european parliament , a fact that is clear from this report .
i am extremely pleased that the third road safety action programme has come about .
from that point of view , we support this proposal .
that is not my last word on the matter .
the development of systems that promote safety does not stand still .
the debate is closed .
so , president , you are particularly welcome .
many thanks , mr president .
monetary growth was strong in 2002 .
that is why i believe this to be so important .
we could do something to change that .
that is why i think it is important to do still more in this area .
( applause )
the principle must be clear : one country , one vote .
many thanks for your work .
that is the responsibility of the member states and that is how things should remain in future .
that is why i am pleased that you have adopted this strategy in this way .
that is our aim .
i do not believe so .
let me answer another question clearly .
the answer is that we do not see that .
that is clear .
their answer was : ' why ?
what 's so special about the euro ?
it is simply their money .
( applause )
the debate is closed .
we must make more progress in this direction .
the euro has provided stability and security .
that is a fact that should be mentioned more often .
he asked for strong coordination of economic policies .
obviously i can only support these proposals , which are a step in the right direction .
some people do not have any of it , or at least not enough of it .
the euro has actually been our currency since 1999 .
madam president , there is a lot in this discussion with which i can agree .
use of the euro and its importance as a currency are increasing all the time , however .
if we could achieve this , it would be important from both economic and political points of view .
the debate is closed .
why should we not do the same with the euro ?
( applause )
it does not give them their due .
where have i heard those words before ?
( applause )
the debate is closed .
that is right .
we will see what we can do .
the next item is the vote .
joint motion for a resolution
mr president , here , too , i have an amendment to the adopted text .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before the vote :
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote :
the question now is what will become of this text .
the reality is very different .
this is a question about justice .
i support the efforts of those two countries in that regard .
for these reasons , we agree with the rapporteur .
i wish to comment here on some of the financial provisions relating to agriculture and fisheries .
that is what i hope will happen .
this would give the wto further powers .
a democratic reform of international trade will take place despite the wto , not through it .
that is why we voted against the report .
i therefore welcome the fact that my amendment has been adopted .
are there any comments ?
he said that he could not reply because he did not have the necessary information .
( the minutes were approved )
i shall now address these .
there are , however , some points your report makes with which the commission cannot agree .
this , then , is where we have to focus more on women 's role in the labour force .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i thank the rapporteur for her initiative .
first of all , i should like to see the common agricultural policy as an opportunity to look at rural development in a new light .
but often society does not accept or support these efforts by the european union to help women .
the debate is closed .
i believe this to be an issue with which we should concern ourselves more and more .
i , for my part , want to comment on two individual issues .
the decision says no more than that .
and what proposals did the european commission come up with ?
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
there is still a need for assistance from the european union .
this situation is completely unacceptable .
this was brought up before in this parliament .
there must be total freedom there .
it is this that we have good reasons to doubt .
we too have come a long way .
violence is still taking place today .
the joint debate is closed .
it must stop .
i doubt that this would happen in the european union .
this is crucial .
in this regard , the commission is always prepared to discuss this issue with the european parliament .
the joint debate is closed .
freedom of speech is essential for democracy .
more children have been taken in the last ten months than in any previous year of the conflict .
much needs to be done .
no !
in addition , there is the question of what the european union is prepared to do to protect the population there and provide humanitarian aid .
you have raised the issue of what the union is doing .
however , we believe that , if we had other external support , our actions would be much more effective .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place next .
that is why we want to add to it .
i do not believe this would be appropriate .
thank you very much for you comment . i have taken good note of it .
parliament has come to the end of its agenda .
statement by the president
the following change has been proposed :
( parliament agreed to the request )
the order of business was thus established .
i raised this matter last week with the french minister for european affairs .
i understand that it will have her urgent attention .
to my point now .
i shall look into the issues you raised .
'
this fund was set up in three months .
my third point concerns civil protection .
it is true that europe must do more .
i doubt it , however .
it is in france .
why is that ?
why ?
what , then , is to be done ?
let us keep this in mind .
why ?
because the governments have not used them ?
i believe this is very serious , because if they are not used , next year we will once again be in the same position .
we must take action at community level .
i believe that it is doing a great deal of good .
we used to have a specific policy , a specific instrument and a specific budget .
even here we do not use the same terms to mean the same thing .
sustainable development , sustainable transport , the sustainable economy : all european policies today are sustainable .
this is still not the case , as we know .
thank you , commissioner .
in any case , i should like to thank you for your comments .
the money is , therefore , there .
i myself have said what i think on this subject .
this applies too to the policies that we support through the structural funds or the funds for transport .
the first is the issue of the legislation .
so much , for a start , for the fundamental principles !
. mr president , this is an important subject .
parliament 's interest in this issue is most welcome .
that is another important reason not to continue the current rules .
mr president .
this , i believe , should show us that we in the committee on budgets should also get involved .
i well understand the concerns of parliament on this matter .
the debate is closed .
i know that in this regard parliament is entirely in agreement with the commission .
mr president , i too would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur .
i just want to quickly address three principles .
that is absolutely vital .
those are three important principles in an excellent report .
that is a very good point .
the debate is closed .
cohesion policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following two reports on cohesion policy :
and
thus it :
the time has therefore come , mr president , for action rather than words .
i should like to comment on the two reports together .
we understand one another better now .
we want to avoid this .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , both reports focus on cohesion in europe .
today is no different .
european policy must , therefore , also promote cohesion .
there must be a regional policy .
that must happen through regional policy , but also through transport policy and competition policy , which are at least as important if we are to be able to live throughout europe .
we must be able to live in these areas .
that is without a doubt the best example of the success of this community policy .
i would like to comment on three areas .
firstly , europe is a community of peace .
it is solidarity that we are talking about today .
the aim of full employment and economic growth must apply in particular to the current objective 1 regions .
naturally , we still need a responsible eu regional policy .
in practice this would mean that only the new member states would receive aid .
well then , what can we do ?
how ?
how could this happen ?
solidarity is one of these .
this is indeed significant .
the policy on research and development is in place , and so is the common agricultural policy .
this regional reality is also relevant at economic and social level .
there are also objective reasons .
the joint debate is closed .
that being the case , there is a practical problem .
that is an important task .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for the work that he has done on this report .
i welcome therefore the commission 's comments on the following points .
the commission 's proposals regarding air service agreements are therefore entirely appropriate .
the debate is closed .
however , as the rapporteur , i have some concerns .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work .
the debate is closed .
the text is concerned with two points .
it is important to pay attention to training .
that is why this is very important .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done .
i shall give an example of the way in which the subject we are discussing might have been significant in my own country .
that is why , in principle , we are in favour of this proposal .
this is why i believe that amendments nos 1 and 2 , tabled by the parliamentary committee concerned , are extremely relevant .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
that is why the report was referred back to committee .
that is a significant step forward .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
after the vote :
i do not think that the committee will change its mind , for technical and political reasons .
why not ?
we voted against this report .
we know , for example , that , in many countries of central europe - countries which will become european union states as of 1 may - regions do not exist .
the rapporteur makes some important points , with which we agree , especially :
we are certain that the european parliament will support the commission 's views on the above amendments .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed
freedom of movement cannot only benefit workers ; it must benefit all european citizens .
that is absolutely essential .
unemployment .
how , though , do things stand in practice ?
i hope that we will now be able to reach a compromise .
we all want citizens to be able to really demand justice in the free movement of workers .
this has not been a success to date .
madam president , first of all , i should like to express my thanks to the commission .
it is then very good if we can make a little progress .
i would like to see an end put to this .
we have to ensure that national legislation is applied in those areas .
few feel up to the task .
these have not been presented to us to date , but are being prepared in the council .
this , however , does not mean that the commission and the council should take them less seriously .
it means , indeed , that many people do not even try to do so .
that is not , of course , at present on the agenda , however .
why ?
because a great deal of money is involved .
that is the first reason .
as has already been said , the progress that has been made is clear to see .
why is this so ?
i agree with that point .
i understand the problem but this is not the solution .
i think that is very important .
i do not myself believe that this will happen .
i must congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
the same result can , however , be achieved in another way .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
would that be possible ?
i would like to know how much time i still have available .
)
there is a need to take issues other than fisheries out of the agreement .
i mentioned some of them .
a fisheries agreement is not the best way for the union to do so , however .
i should also like to welcome the fact that the committee on fisheries has adopted the main amendments tabled by the committee on budgets .
the committee is also aware of the specific economic situation in that country .
let me point out , though , that this regulation will not work without effort .
i believe that we should have further serious discussions about this .
have we been asked about them ?
there is no doubt that the eu 's fisheries agreements with third countries are now a significant part of the common fisheries policy .
commissioner , i would like to congratulate you on your speech and the communication that has been made .
there is agreement in the commission , there is agreement in the council , as i understand it , and there will also be agreement in this parliament .
we need to review the whole idea of having third country agreements .
we should review the whole situation .
the debate is closed .
i have a second question .
what is in fact the situation as regards regional quality products ?
not all developing countries are the same , however .
the second point is workers ' rights .
how are we to get this issue into the wto negotiations ?
mr president , i shall take these questions one by one and in short order .
we will carry on down this road .
commissioner , how do you see the agricultural negotiations develop in the wto ?
are they in a position to do so ?
this is what compromise is all about . i cannot put myself in the place of developing countries and say what is , or is not , in their interests .
it had to be done to show others the way forward .
we will take questions to the commission .
part i
. the european union is absolutely clear about the position .
commissioner , thank you very much for your reply .
. ( de ) mr president , as you so rightly say , no question has been put .
i would , though , like to make one thing clear .
that is left to the individual farmers as a management decision .
we do not pay our farmers for doing nothing , and nor will we do so in the future .
what does this mean ?
i do not see a problem in that .
the commission therefore has no information on this matter .
. no , i cannot do that .
i have done what i could .
thank you very much , commissioner .
. absolutely .
we have to keep trying .
mr president , i wish to thank the commissioner for his answer .
without that there is not much in it at all .
this is where we are at the moment .
thank you very much commissioner .
i should like to thank the commissioner for her reply .
as far as i know , we have not yet received this particular report .
that is where we are .
i thank the commissioner .
additional funds from community instruments such as the structural funds and the cohesion fund are also available for the purpose mentioned by the honourable member .
we will continue to do so .
i cannot answer your question today .
the present quality of the data is acceptable to the commission .
i put in my report a list of rights that should be included in any un convention .
we need all member states to implement the current employment directive that is due to be implemented this year .
if people do not have access to public transport they cannot get to their place of work .
then we look at civil and political rights .
we share the same principles and the same objectives .
we need her to do so ; indeed , in the vote that will take place tomorrow we call on her to do so .
this is extremely important .
this will be a great opportunity .
it is clear , as the commissioner said , that we need to address this in our development and aid policies .
we need a convention to do that .
therefore we have to accept our own responsibility for that .
much , however , remains to be done .
the debate is closed .
these rights may exist on paper , but they are not a reality .
i can already tell you that this has been done .
let me now turn to the amendments .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner very much for his information .
this is not an acceptable situation .
the debate is closed .
the aim of this is to increase the programme 's impact on the groups involved .
this is an important period , however .
finally , i would again address the issue of the budget .
so we could ask ourselves , what kind of rule of law is this if it does not protect women ?
we do indeed lack a legal basis .
this is the only comment i am going to make today .
too many women and children are victims , as was mentioned earlier .
this is , of course , not enough to be able to do everything that should be done , but i think that this is the best we can hope for at the moment .
thank you , mr president .
it is not , however , the money that concerns me .
it is all the more important that help should be given at european level .
which were successful ?
i understand .
the debate is closed .
the final point is the euro .
we will of course vote against ourselves , for a good reason .
the debate is closed .
i think this has to be made very clear .
for that to happen , though , we need to see progress in certain areas .
the european union , however , is not entirely in the clear either .
this means that we must stand united .
colleagues , welcome to this special debate on the european convention .
he is not yet present but i am sure we will see him soon .
this is an unacceptable risk that no one has the right to take .
furthermore , the union is given new means with which to act in three areas in which the citizens believe them to be a priority .
this is , therefore , an open proposal .
i should like to say a few words about the role that you will have to play in this process .
the convention has achieved what it set out to do .
this could have serious consequences .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
we are therefore pleased with the end result .
a great deal has been achieved .
( applause )
then there is the key issue of the future balance of powers between the commission , the council and parliament .
( applause )
the commission will continue to do its part to help achieve that aim .
( applause )
why ?
it is true that we have done so , but we have done so precisely in order to provide the european union with greater democracy .
the convention did precisely that .
that , ladies and gentlemen , is our success .
they had a hand in what was finally agreed on .
that is something we have to prevent .
( applause )
do you really believe , mr president of the commission , that what you have said here has not also been said and discussed in the convention ?
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
you are very welcome here .
that is what i have to ask of you .
( applause )
we do not share the opinion of those who believe that this was the best that the convention could do .
at european level as a whole ?
at national level ?
in that case , what would happen if the majority of people in a single member state voted ' no ' ?
to a state or to an international organisation ?
thank you very much .
that is a crucial point .
this point has not been raised .
we have done away with this term , which goes back to the beginning of the convention .
i thank everyone who has taken part in the debate .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
before the vote :
the rapporteur is in agreement with this .
' .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote :
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
i hope so , given that i voted for the text .
we also need to look to the future .
such issues are also outside the scope of the regulation .
i hope this will be possible at second reading stage .
this programme cannot , however , be implemented in the most effective way possible with the level of funding provided for by the commission .
could they not have seen it coming ?
why is that ?
this is an extremely important report for the implementation of social policy in the union .
i have therefore voted in favour of it .
they will have much to offer to the development of our social policy agenda .
that is why it is important :
i therefore believe we should all show solidarity and support this report .
there must therefore be increasing support for this objective .
so what has the commission been doing to help this process ? our first priority was to provide humanitarian assistance .
far from it .
that , it also has to be said , has unfortunately happened .
where is that going to get us ?
the problem is that the un has come to no such decision .
they , like all of us , have the right to a different kind of life and a different kind of development .
there are many members who supported that policy in this parliament .
we know what that does .
it is the same with iraq .
we must provide help .
it is our responsibility , and it is also in our interests to do so .
i know what i am talking about in this regard .
what is all conflict about ?
principle number two is to have institutions to do that .
i agreed with much of what was said during this debate .
she was right to say that we need a policy framework for what we do .
we have to know what is going to be required .
there are three things that i want to mention again .
the debate is closed .
the european union 's role in the world concerns the european citizens and therefore their representatives .
what is the opinion of the commission and the council ?
children .
the report states : ' the ? political ?
this is a good , relevant reference .
there is nothing but the conflict .
the same applies to relations with russia and other major countries .
we must do all we can to protect them and humanitarian aid workers around the world .
finally , you will see that not one of us , and i mean not one of us , will agree with everything that is adopted .
after all , very positive things can be mentioned in this area too .
this is an urgent matter .
it could be done .
we do not have one .
we are trying to create one .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
too much progress is still required .
i simply wanted us to share what is best in each of our countries .
that is the aim of the report .
i wish to comment on three areas .
we cannot have this situation .
are any of the member states really in such a situation ?
i think not .
( applause from the right )
nevertheless , there are other issues which prevent an entirely positive assessment of it .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , some of us are extremely concerned : ' our children , our children , our children ?
' .
that means that not all the proposals and amendments were of my making .
thank you very much to the rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
. that is a very good point .
to date , no decisions have been taken on the matter , but i am sure that the council will come back to the issue .
thank you minister .
what do you think of this idea ?
would this be possible and are you able to take the matter further ?
in fact , this is just one of the reasons .
i do not think it is appropriate to open negotiations on these issues .
indeed , these same countries stress in their reports that they are not in a position to support further negotiations .
we are trying to do something about that .
there is no such pressure .
that is the approach .
this is what makes things so extremely difficult .
you do not get very far with that kind of money .
we know what to do there .
this is why the important issue of fair water management was put on the agenda .
i cannot do that here .
this is with good reason .
that goes without saying .
we expect the same and more from the council and the commission .
the question is , will the wto 's rules allow them to do that ?
i do not doubt that it can , but it is certainly not the only way .
this is positive and should , in my view , be fully supported .
free trade is after all not the solution for these problems .
what is it that these people can do to make all of us better off ?
well , i want to see them fight .
the free market does not actually exist any more .
there is still much to be done , but there is also hope .
a european fund is vital .
this will also mean increasing public funding .
it therefore requires protection and regulation not only by states , but also at international level .
we are also sure that the commission can take action in this direction .
then we will have fair trade .
there is only one answer : water .
not democracy .
not human rights .
this is what these people need .
parliament needs to be involved .
i want this to happen .
i understand what you are doing and i have confidence in it .
that is the key to trade .
i hope he will do more .
this is not difficult to understand .
it does not matter if we use the word ' fund ' .
we hope that this debate and the welcome support from parliament will make it possible for member states to accept what we have proposed .
that is what we are trying to do .
the joint debate is closed .
indeed , i call for more and better investment in these areas .
let me start with the final point in our report .
this is unacceptable .
that will not achieve results .
we heard in the last debate about water .
women , too , are especially at risk .
there is no lack of information from us .
what , furthermore , if they do not understand the issues they are taking decisions about ?
the debate is closed .
they are crucial to us for four reasons .
democracy and development go hand in hand .
we must , we should and we will .
in some countries these things are very new .
it is not our country .
it is simply wrong .
it does not .
it is possible to keep it that way .
this should be given more attention .
i want to say one last thing .
he has my full support .
it is even more important , therefore , for the commission to take this step in the right direction at last .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
so , as you will see from the new report , we really are trying to improve it .
on the other , it is a public information instrument .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
we now have to decide how to achieve it .
i have already had several opportunities to talk to you about this issue .
would the president like one ?
.
various resolutions have been adopted in this respect .
nevertheless , there is still a great deal left to be done in this area .
peace in europe is not only about effective economic cooperation .
why ?
we therefore know what has to be done .
i give you my word .
let us try it at least !
mr president , thank you very much for your words .
he has been allowed to speak and i have not .
that is what i understand from the reply i have been given .
i would call on those states that have not yet done this to do so .
the debate is closed .
however , there are european issues we need to address .
what did we note in this report on the application of the directive ?
i do not think that it is up to the commission to take the initiative in this field .
this aspect is thus being taken into account .
full coordination is therefore needed here .
it may be public .
the main provisions of this directive must not be called into question .
thank you , mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
we know what it is not .
we will have to give our opinion on this fundamental problem .
the second point i want to address is the protection of young people .
we must , therefore , give a specific response through a commission initiative to this effect .
in this year , above all , we should make progress to that end .
the debate is closed .
they have to do with creation .
the commission must look at these issues and put forward proposals to us , perhaps by way of the green paper .
thank you .
we take note of your statement .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament approved the resolution )
joint motion for a resolution
i should now like to ask you whether this is still possible .
that is very kind of you .
( applause from the right )
you have not taken account of the fact that one group has not voted in the same way in both cases .
you did not do that mr president .
( applause from the right )
( parliament approved the resolution )
i will vote against this compromise .
i would ask the honourable members not to take it into account .
it is not appropriate to speak here about the fundamental issue .
( parliament approved the resolution )
president .
mr president , i ask that the following change be made to the amendment on which we are currently voting .
if they are in agreement , i will support their amendment ; if not , i will vote against it .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
i hope that the commission will take that up .
i am very pleased with the result of that vote and to have taken part in it .
i have voted against .
and why ?
we have done so ? but that does not mean we should not try to understand them .
this is a joint initiative by the european parliament , the commission , the council and the member states .
today , mr president , we have voted on two reports on human rights .
) interests ' ?
i hope that they will never do it .
then we will be able to take decisions in this field .
the following proposals are completely unacceptable :
1 .
2 .
3 .
4 .
respect for human rights .
i could do nothing other than vote against this report .
i support the proposal for greater health investment in developing countries and effective monitoring of the results .
i therefore agreed with most of this report .
we also have the financial means .
despite this , i feel that this report as a whole is positive .
i voted in favour .
) of the citizens of europe ' ?
) .
for all of these reasons , i will not vote in favour of this report .
i should like to address two points made by the commissioner .
i would like the commissioner to address those two issues .
this is not a new issue .
the situation cannot continue for two reasons .
i would , therefore , just like to ask myself - and you - some questions .
this is unacceptable .
thank you , mr president .
what type of cooperation is the commission talking about ?
mr president , my position is rather different from some of those expressed here .
that would be the answer .
others have mentioned that member states have to agree .
this is not the only place in the world where we have to decide on these matters .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
here the question of development aid has become more important than ever .
i look forward to discussing it with parliament during the course of this coming year .
this is an internal eu discussion .
we have , as you say , a single market .
this is unfortunately also true of various eu member states .
. mr president , i should like to make just a few points .
the debate is closed .
i certainly hope it will not .
the european union should also look into this issue .
this is not , unfortunately , always the case .
that , of course , is the right response .
the joint debate is closed .
some things were possible , but only very little .
this , unfortunately , is not the case .
the joint debate is closed .
no one has seen her since .
political pressure should increase .
he has set the problem out very well .
we fully agree with the honourable members of parliament that this process will also need the support of the international community .
the joint debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
we must continue to give them our support .
she was one of the very best .
the following changes have been proposed :
mr president , i would like to speak in favour of this request .
which is the request that you wish to stand ?
we need to vote on this .
there may be legal issues here but allow me to come to those in a moment .
the basic political question is whether or not to refer this report back to committee .
so the report is then on the agenda .
i would just like to bring up a matter which has already come to the attention of this house several times .
it is our job to set an example .
we will see what we can do .
mr president , i would like to draw your attention to a serious matter .
that is the only thing we were working on .
for me this is one of the two most important conclusions .
as far as i know , they have in fact all done that .
what are they like ?
that is the first question i have for the commission .
we must make sure that this kind of thing does not happen again in the future .
we must do that better than we are currently doing .
this is important .
that is the first thing that must be said .
i am going to look at it from the point of view of health at work .
this is not the issue we are here to discuss , however . it will be decided during another debate .
mr president , commissioner , we must answer some questions to which a response has not yet been given .
ladies and gentlemen , i would like , in particular , to draw your attention to tomorrow 's vote .
i would like , if i may , to go back over a number of points made in the opinion of the committee on fisheries .
what will we have to say that is new ?
i support the rapporteur 's call for such a committee in his amendment no 11 .
we on this side of the house are not prepared to let that happen .
we are prepared to back parliament 's rapporteur and look to the other side of this house to do the same .
i would therefore like to ask the commissioner whether she will express her support for this .
i believe that we must continue this work .
in conclusion , i want to say that it is all too clear that there is a political conflict within the european union itself .
in this respect , mr president , i would like to mention the rapporteur 's amendment no 11 .
so we are here now in this parliament with the opportunity to ensure for once that that does not happen .
no , of course not .
that is what the minister says .
instead , we need such support as we can get .
that is a road on which we can make further progress .
i believe that this does not currently happen as often as it should .
i would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done .
our group will support this .
in very practical terms , the eu can do three things .
what is position of the member states ' ?
i also would like to mention an example .
we all know the answer to these questions .
however , allow me to make a few comments .
that was not what we were trying to do in this house , however .
that was the context of the report .
that is of no concern , however .
what is of concern is who took the decision and why .
it is important .
from our point of view , the situation is such that this should be done right away , and not in several years ' time .
we need more support and action from the commission .
i shall return to this in a moment .
an open debate with the council would be a good start .
what we need is a task force .
it cannot simply be left to individual member states to act alone .
this is an idea whose time has come and action should be taken upon it .
so there was a problem .
this is the information i have .
there was a commission , a parliament and a council of ministers and nothing was done .
that was the situation , ladies and gentlemen .
ladies and gentlemen , i would ask you to accept that this is what we must talk about with a view to the future .
thank you very much for your words , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
we are therefore clearly talking about a consumer protection measure .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , energy is among the key issues for the eu .
my report changes a number of points in the proposal for a directive .
the market is not always right .
the committee has adopted a number of amendments that balance community and national interests .
the majority of my own amendments - the most significant - were adopted .
nor do i see any reason why , in the future too , they should not be different .
the first problem is the proposal 's legal basis .
a second problem is that there is no need for this proposal .
it will not !
then we will see what further progress we can make at second reading stage .
i think that we will be able to reach an agreement during the vote tomorrow .
that will be the real problem .
that is what the commission has already made a start on , and that makes a lot of sense .
i think we really have to go in another direction .
however , i believe that this debate on energy security has never been so important .
that is not what we are talking about .
and that is what we are talking about .
the debate is closed .
why ?
what is the situation regarding this matter ?
i would also like to make it clear that this is not a commission initiative . this is an initiative by a member state .
that is still an open question at present .
that is what we all want .
that is why i , and my political group , support the rapporteur 's position .
when all is said and done , then , mr president , that is why today 's debate took place .
the debate is closed .
that has not always been the case in the past .
this is by no means the case at the present time .
this is something we also wish to achieve through our work .
i have made my position clear .
i hope that it will be fully supported in the house tomorrow .
that is unacceptable .
the debate is closed .
is this what we want ?
we hope that the european central bank , with its new president , will give such a policy the appropriate support .
i think that would take us much further forward .
the debate is closed .
that is not the case .
i am very concerned about this situation : many of these amendments are fundamental .
you were right to want to put an end to this .
this is what we want to hear .
so what do we want ?
we should be aware of this .
and that is precisely why we need a community directive .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the subject we are discussing here is a difficult subject .
i believe that it is necessary to put an end to this by way of this directive , if we get it .
i think it would be a good idea to establish this in the directive .
why ?
we are not in fact without rights now .
we all know the reality of the market .
perhaps there are points that can be brought up to date in legal terms .
why ?
not at all .
i also believe that we cannot adopt the proposal now because , if we do , the states will do their own thing .
we must try to do the best we can here .
if these amendments are not accepted , i will vote against the directive .
that is very important to us .
so be it .
the question is whether there is any point in doing so any more .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , what is the real issue here ?
why , then , is such a text being proposed in this parliament ?
therefore , if the amendments such as those proposed by the committee on industry and the committee on culture are not approved , it will be very difficult for us to support this proposal .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there are a number of things i do not understand .
i do not understand what is going on here .
i understand this very well and i share this concern .
i hope that we can all live with these amendments .
ladies and gentlemen , do we really need this directive ?
we need this directive .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur .
thank you very much , commissioner .
mr president , i did not want to make this point during my speech , but it is necessary that it should be made .
the debate is closed .
this should also be possible in europe .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
before the vote :
my committee accepted that proposal .
this situation cannot continue .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the text )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
president .
colleagues , under the circumstances i propose that we refer this matter back to committee .
( parliament agreed to the proposal )
before the vote :
( parliament agreed to the proposal )
before the vote :
we now continue with the vote .
before the vote on amendment no 11 :
i am trying to keep out of a political discussion that is taking place in one of the member states of the european union .
it is therefore not accepted .
before the vote on amendment no 3 :
the real reason is quite different .
that is why we voted against this report .
above all , it is one of the demands of the people of europe .
there would have been a real problem !
' as a result , i voted for the motion .
that , however , is not the case .
that is the reason we voted against this report .
they were :
that is why we voted in favour of the report .
i am in favour of such a development .
safety is down to us all and demands all our commitment !
let us hope that these measures will mean that my region or any other will experience them never again .
never again !
if we look back over the last four years , we can see that there have been significant changes to the way in which the budgetary procedure has taken place .
there is also the real question of what the real needs of enlargement are , especially within the institutions .
it is the first year of the enlargement and we must do everything we can to make the enlargement a success .
now the budget in general .
what do we do about iraq ?
i understand that change is not possible from one day to the next , but perhaps the commission could make a statement about this .
perhaps the council can say something about this .
we want to try to avoid this state of affairs this year .
a lot of discussion will also be needed on the commission 's human resources policy .
this has happened again this year on the commission 's budget .
therefore , i would like to ask the president-in-office 's opinion about the approach that i have taken on his decisions .
we need to have a balance here .
i want to understand the council 's strategy .
my next question is to the commission .
it is a good procedure .
thank you for your attention .
i should like to refer to two points in particular .
one is commission reform .
the report also needs to show , quite clearly , where the reforms have not taken place .
the other point is the question of iraq .
that may be a response to conditions in the member states .
however , we must also set priorities for the budget . that is something which we will certainly do .
we will have to debate this issue more often as part of the budget process from now on as well .
this applies especially to foreign policy .
it will also have an impact on us .
this has long been our group 's clear objective .
the commission should have .
thank you very much .
according to our agenda , some of the people you have mentioned will be present during this debate , but later on .
i mention this for your information .
i would therefore like to ask the commissioner whether she can give us her opinion on this .
how can you use them in a positive way ?
i must also comment on the management of the budget .
what is the commission 's response to this ?
we hope this proposal will be approved .
this is unacceptable .
this is one of the most important aspects .
from a general point of view , this is the year in which we should avoid the conflict between national and community interests .
we must also promote information in relation to the common agricultural policy .
mr president , a number of amendments to the budget were adopted by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
let me now return to the amendments that the committee on agriculture and rural development adopted .
finally , i would like to discuss some of the priorities set by the general rapporteur .
thank you for your attention .
we have had this discussion before .
just do not let the commission get into the same way of doing things .
the third issue i would like to focus on is the fisheries agreements .
( applause )
we are very concerned about some of its activities and the way in which the commission is dealing with it .
that is fundamental .
i also believe that it is essential that the principle of political responsibility should be implemented , in practical terms .
parliament will only decide how much money is available in a particular administrative area .
now a legal basis is being established for the system and the question of assistance is to be for the commission to decide .
this measure must be implemented as soon as possible .
that will be very welcome .
i want to see total implementation .
as far as the response to parliament and the council is concerned , i respect it .
i do not ask for that for one second .
we need people !
mr president , i would , therefore , like to mention three points :
the structural policy consequences of enlargement .
this is a difficult point , as i have often said in this house .
what are the budgetary effects of this enlargement ?
that is an increase of around 20 % .
so far as enlargement is concerned , it is not really an issue .
i myself do not expect this at all .
i think we should put a stop to this .
now we have to ensure that the programmes get the necessary level of funding .
we are doing so already , but with the future regional policy we are working on and for which i need your support we can go a lot further .
it is simply that we have to be able to pay when the time comes .
mr president , i make this statement on behalf of the committee on home affairs and as its rapporteur .
thank you .
i hope the commission will take these points seriously .
i would like to draw your attention to that .
i turn now to the field of information and communication .
what have we done ?
that would be a great step forward for the democratic future of our union .
i have nothing but full confidence in that programme .
i welcome this project .
there was one matter that was left .
the same applies to the economic and social committee .
it therefore seems very wrong to me to pay european tax money for national decisions .
thank you , madam president .
there must be at least two partners .
i thank parliament for its support for the proposals i have presented .
the honourable member will think that this is not much money .
that said , we must focus for a moment on the points made during the debate .
i believe that this is one of the principles of democracy , of our political culture , and i believe it is a principle that we all share .
. mr president , i just want to thank those members who have taken part in this debate .
the debate is closed .
you did not actually say so at the beginning , but i very much hope that i and other colleagues here will have the opportunity to do so .
the decision has , however , already been taken : you will not be able to ask the commissioner questions at the end of his statement .
it has taken a decision and it has decided not to take another .
i come now to the decision that was not taken .
so that is the decision the commission did not take .
i shall mention three of these .
i should like to say right away that that is a matter which is of no interest to us .
the answer is ' no ' .
i see that as positive and i should like to congratulate you on this in this house .
that is the reality .
we are not doing that .
this is the task of state aid control .
the debate is closed .
thank you , mr president , for that address .
here also , i fully agree with you .
i will deal with those last .
it is for the new europe that we are developing the consumer area .
does it give value for money ?
access to information is an essential guarantee of consumer protection .
we must go further , however .
i think it is appropriate that other people should know who they are .
it is important to say that this should go through at first reading , despite what i have just said .
i agree with the rapporteur that this is an important issue .
this is as it should be .
but i must say to the commissioner that such a policy should not just apply to us ; it should apply to everyone in authority and especially to those in public service .
they are quite wrong .
i particularly want to discuss the aid given to small consumer organisations and , in particular , to the new member states .
i very much hope that regional consumer organisations will make good use of such opportunities .
we have been making progress on this issue .
the committee , therefore , has a key role to play in the implementation of the proposed framework .
the debate is closed .
there is good reason to address these problems .
we shall then also address the subject of enlargement .
within this framework , both the european strategy on employment and the european social fund are being called on to play an important role .
this is already the case in a number of countries , and i think that those countries set a good example for other member states that have not done this to date .
finally , i hope that the commissioner will particularly take the position of women into consideration .
i hope that the same thing will happen in tomorrow 's vote .
what does the commission tell us about the situation of our member states ?
it is not so much a debate as a beginning .
it is a first step .
mr president , i too would like to thank the commissioner and , in particular , the rapporteur for his work on this issue .
it is only now that we are beginning to take action on it .
in the light of this , it is unacceptable for us to say that we could carry on as we are for ever .
i would also like to thank the commission and the council for their joint report .
in the end the whole of european society would face the consequences .
it is , after all , the reality .
there is a need to address that issue .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
the debate is closed .
this future directive remains a positive step , both for the internal market and for sustainable development policies .
i will reply at the end of the debate giving the commission 's opinion on some of the amendments .
i share his view that the proposal is a small step in the right direction .
i should like to bring to your attention a few other matters .
it is time we were serious about its implementation .
thus far about the amendments .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work .
the debate is closed .
the required conditions for data protection ;
that is certainly going too far .
what are our specific problems ?
the debate is closed .
there are many people in my country who would say that the compromise does not go far enough to meet their concerns .
i believe it will be good for consumers .
thank you , mr president .
that is why we have supported two main principles : quality of information and fair competition .
later she accepted it .
of course he should have the best price !
transparency is therefore essential .
it was a very difficult task , but we were successful .
why do we even need a directive ?
what are the main points of our compromise and the new regulations ?
i would ask everyone to vote in favour of the compromise the day after tomorrow .
i hope , commissioner , you will take note of that .
but if the financial services plan is to work , this directive has to be in place .
the debate is closed .
the second point on which we agree is on what was accepted at the convention .
nevertheless , it is important simply to note today that a new and different stage is about to begin , namely the intergovernmental conference .
in view of europe 's enlargement , it is important that we try to achieve this .
having said this , mr president , and having heard the president ?
that cannot be the case .
it is not acceptable from the point of view not just of transparency , but of democratic responsibility .
the majority of foreign affairs ministers were members of the convention .
i support the president 's proposals that there should not be technical working groups .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i hope that this house will today back the convention 's draft , and do so by a large majority .
the convention was successful when it was free .
did you not agree to a great compromise ?
there was not one vote , however .
not a single vote .
what do we see there ?
what does this amount to ?
that is not fair , and it is not at all democratic .
when matters become serious , people get involved in them .
that is not enough .
this is not what being european means , at least not for me !
that is something i would very much welcome .
if not at the intergovernmental conference , then when is that to be done ?
. mr president , the fisheries sector is in crisis .
that is something of which i should like to ask everyone - the commission , the council and the representatives of the european parliament - to be aware .
mr president , in ten days ' time yet another intergovernmental conference will get under way .
we should be going back to first principles .
last of all , i wish to refer to one matter that was not mentioned .
i might add that the same applies to other aspects .
that is not what the role of the commission should be .
one of these is the reform process .
it goes against every political development of europe in every direction .
i should like to thank you for your contribution to this house .
i understand that this is the last speech you will make to the house .
the convention was a success .
the reason is that an aspect which is fundamental to us , and i believe also to many european citizens , has not been considered as fully as we had asked for .
that cannot happen ; it must not be allowed to happen .
let us give europe back to the citizens .
i would also like to see real coordination of economic policies and majority decisions in the field of foreign affairs .
all too often european citizens do not feel that this is actually the case .
which draft , though , do we see before us ?
will enough decisions be taken by majority vote ?
the answer to too many of these questions has to be ' no ' .
the debate is closed .
there is no further debate today .
i think it is important that we are able to do so .
this is why i support the majority of these proposals !
of course i have voted against it .
however , in the end i voted against the report .
this is why i voted against the directive .
i voted against the directive .
that is why i voted against it .
that is why we believe there is a need for an eu directive .
in the final vote , we voted in favour .
the right conditions and instruments are needed , though , if these objectives are to be achieved .
my vote in favour does not , however , mean that i agree with all the rapporteur 's views .
for these reasons , i voted in favour of this report .
this is why we voted against this report .
like the rapporteur , i welcome the close cooperation between member states in this area .
this is why we voted against this report .
that was not the case yesterday .
each member state should have its own full commissioner with voting rights .
it is the member states that own the treaty .
we do , however , believe that a number of amendments to the draft are necessary .
i believe , however , that a few changes are necessary , in particular at institutional level .
why , then , did i decide to vote for this resolution that i do not like ?
i cannot support proposals for increased military cooperation , which i consider to be a national issue .
what should our strategy be ?
is this still possible ?
we must go further .
only by means of a global solution can peace and stability be established .
that is one issue that we can all agree on .
how do we go on from here ?
this is not a positive development .
for what is left of it ?
in that case , there will be no peace .
on what list are we going to put that ?
the answer to that is ' no ' .
what contribution are we making to that ?
what contribution can we make to it ?
this is where there is a need for further initiatives , especially together with the united nations , if we are to make a positive contribution in this area too .
what can europe do ?
i do not think that is enough .
this was too much , however !
mr president , violence in this conflict cannot offer a solution .
that is the parliament 's task .
we must work on what europe is doing .
i would like to put this question to the council , and also , and above all , to the commission .
europe must open a line of support for these victims .
the debate is closed .
where did we go wrong ?
therefore , we must ask ourselves now , in this house , whether europe did everything possible .
could we have done more ?
we must go back to that point and start again .
the second debate is the wto reforms .
how and where ?
how did this come about ?
why do i say that ?
that is not all by a long way .
we should , however , go over a number of points of assessment with each other .
perhaps we need to talk to them again about this .
where do we go from here ?
this is why global rules for protection are necessary .
not everything can , or should , be done through the wto .
this requires new initiatives from the commission and the council .
my second question is : what should we do ?
can you tell me if you are prepared to do that ?
' why ?
we have to move forward .
that is the question which needs to be asked and i hope that the intergovernmental conference will also ask it seriously .
what is to be done , then ?
what is to be done at the world trade organisation ( wto ) ?
all that is true .
i think there is a lot in that .
unfortunately i have no more time left .
that could , at long last , open up the possibility of real development for the developing countries .
which rules , though ?
but this is not just a matter of the developing and the developed world .
it could go further , of course .
if it is true for the others , it is therefore true for us .
it is essential for developing countries to open up their markets and accept a number of rules .
i agree on this issue , and we are going to think about it .
i also agree with it .
' and will not provide guidelines on the direction we should take in future .
this is the overall problem to which we must now try and find an answer .
it was still an excellent proposal .
so what role did the united states play ?
my second point is this : i very much believe that it was the right thing to reform the common agricultural policy .
that is the only way for us to make progress .
the problem is when we start to address specific issues .
and here we have to look at the question of funding .
we should now have been a small step further down the road if the council had also accepted the commission 's proposals , as parliament has done .
here is a practical example .
there is a lot more that needs to be said , but i hope that we will have other opportunities to say it .
it is therefore important to appropriate more funds .
sustainable development , however , cannot be achieved without economic and social development , full stop .
this would benefit sustainable development too .
what is first of all necessary is a list of priorities and , secondly of course , the funding .
the debate is closed .
the use of public sector information is naturally a very important issue .
nevertheless , we have to accept the fact that reality is far more difficult than we should like .
that is simply not possible .
the council did not want to use the word ' information ' - it only wanted to speak of ' document ' .
i asked the council , therefore , whether it is a european document society that we have or a european information society .
finally , i should like to thank my colleagues , in particular , for the confidence they have shown in me .
i should like to thank everyone for their confidence and for the help they have given me .
the commission can accept all the amendments .
i want to draw attention to just one other thing , namely the review of this directive , in which i hope this parliament will be involved in future .
we have to follow things through .
i wish to thank him for that .
this is an important area .
that is a lot .
the debate is closed .
there are many others .
in particular , what price are we to pay ?
this aspect of the monitoring is also , therefore , extremely important .
the debate is closed .
clearly , therefore , progress is being made .
some problems remain .
there is no appropriate legal basis for such a step .
what do you need ?
how can we help you ?
the question is , however , whether citizens can find them .
i think that that is a good idea .
i think that a good deal more must be done in that regard .
something must be done about this as soon as possible .
i should like to thank him .
certain areas really must be discussed .
there is clearly now at last an increasing interest in eu issues around europe .
there is still a good deal to do where these are concerned .
it must not be too difficult .
yesterday , internal discussions were held between the three institutions to consider the progress achieved .
these rights could include the right to defence , in criminal cases , or economic rights in business cases .
mr president , i should like to thank the whole house for its interest in this subject .
i might not even be present myself .
thank you commissioner .
the debate is closed .
i will not go into them all .
it is an important environmental directive .
better air also means a better environment , which in turn means better health .
thank you , too , to my colleagues in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
it is important that this protection continue , including in the new directive .
i also support the amendments with this purpose , therefore .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done so far .
i am quite sure we can carry on with this work and make sure that we have a good result in the end .
i wish to thank and congratulate the commission .
we have to go forward with it .
let the market be free .
let us have some competition .
allow me to return to the question of the purpose and the scope of the proposal .
that is amendment no 11 .
this is not acceptable to the commission .
in other words , they are of little environmental concern .
there was one thing i did not understand .
we think they have the same content and the commission has accepted them in principle .
the debate is closed .
i would like to make three points in response to this part of the question .
the reform of the common agricultural policy and the fisheries policy is a step in the right direction .
however , further efforts are needed in these and other areas , such as energy and transport .
this integration is difficult for many reasons .
there is also a problem with the whole of the economic model .
allow me to give a practical example .
we need more aid , but also better aid .
for this , reforms to the trade system are needed , as i say .
i was there .
that is a good thing .
progress has to be made with the economic , social and environmental circumstances at the same time .
we have not reached that point yet at world level .
it would be good if the european union were to take more initiatives in this regard .
sustainable development has developed over time .
it does not have to be this way .
what have we been doing ?
the discussion so far in the council has presented difficulties for some member states .
our other problem is that we know each other , perhaps , too well in our discussions on sustainable development .
that has been a problem within the council .
thank you commissioner .
welcome
however , i have one or two points .
there is a second question , moreover .
i would therefore like to express our thanks and our support for his future work .
two matters of this kind are currently at issue .
the debate is closed .
i think it has been a successful year .
i believe this to be important , especially before enlargement .
i am saying this to show that , in some cases , national issues do , where necessary , receive a lot of attention from the european commission .
i thank all the honourable members for their work .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
was the directive being applied then ?
let me be clear .
that is why i cannot support this report .
this is an opinion .
i was a rapporteur for the last two years on the reports on the implementation and monitoring of community law .
this matter is not going to go away .
that is our only concern .
and , of course , it is a question of the application of community law .
however , we do not know at this moment who is right .
the role of the commission , as i have said time and again , is to see that present legislation is in line with present european law .
my reply to them would be the same as my reply in this case - that is not the job of the commission .
that is what i would like to say .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
we now continue with the vote .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
joint motion for a resolution
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
it is done now .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
( parliament adopted the resolution )
before the vote on the resolution as a whole :
that has been agreed .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
president .
i congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work .
the european union must take account of the most recent information and draft a further reform , which should provide greater protection for our agricultural model .
why is that the case ?
that is the first issue .
we have not yet achieved our aim ; we do not yet have this issue fully under control .
as i have already said , there is a lot of money to be made .
we would be pleased if the french initiative were successful .
we hope your work in the council of europe also goes well .
these are the demands of the movement for peace .
we support them , which is why we shall not vote for the report .
mr president , commissioner , so much is clear .
the debate is closed .
this document will be presented to parliament in due course .
that is what i wanted to say on this question .
that is why i welcome the fact , commissioner , that the commission is making this issue such a high priority .
in the end , however , it was not that .
i will say no more , but this must be included in the minutes .
all our words will be included in the minutes .
from this point of view , i congratulate you on any initiatives you take .
i am therefore pleased to add my support , ladies , to what you have said on this issue .
i wanted to make that clear in the light of the concerns you expressed just now .
the debate is closed .
on this point i do not agree with the opinion you have just expressed , commissioner .
let us not stop there , either .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the vote .
( parliament adopted the text )
president .
