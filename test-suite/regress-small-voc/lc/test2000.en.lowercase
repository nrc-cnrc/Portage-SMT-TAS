the debate is closed .
amendments nos 10 , 11 and 15 are acceptable in principle .
we will be able to support all of this and we also want to support it .
we are discussing a serious matter .
no one does .
we all want the same thing and we have to say this very clearly here in parliament .
however , let me first address the amendments with which the commission cannot agree .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
commissioner , i would like to thank you for being here today and for your statement .
with regard to social and economic research , it is quite clear that there is a place for this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
are there any further comments on the minutes ?
that is not good enough .
a further point is the commission reforms .
we should also take a look at our own situation , however .
i will not take this into consideration .
i am less pleased with the idea expressed in paragraph 2 that state aid should not go up .
the proposals put forward by our committee and supported by the committee on budgets are much better .
i should not like you to think that the council does not answer the questions asked of it .
i have tabled an amendment on this subject , and i hope you will support it .
the final point concerns the amendments .
commissioner , you said that you were against a number of amendments .
but we need to go further than this .
madam president , in that case the amendment will unfortunately have to be put to the vote in the form proposed by the committee on budgets .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is why our resolution is important , and i have voted for it .
we need to go further .
they need the help of the member states .
that is why we should ' think small first ' .
( applause )
i should like to make a second point .
this is the aim of our amendments .
i could not agree with him more .
we must take our rights seriously if we want governments to respect them and legal systems to guarantee them .
we must move in this direction .
there are , however , other effects , particularly on our internal legal system .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
it is far from clear .
this is essential .
i want to focus on the regulations .
the commission has presented a paper on this to the committee on budgets .
in addition , there is the question of what the scope of current standards in europe is and what the scope of european standards would be .
we are at first reading .
this is certainly positive .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
unfortunately we are not in a position to welcome that yet .
i would like to know , commissioner , whether the commission can tell us anything about this .
let me add a few comments on what i said earlier in this respect .
but we do not have that much time !
colleagues , this directive makes sense .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
in this context , the commission is taking action and we have specific projects for each of those three areas .
that is precisely the point of our resolution .
human rights
the problem of course , is what should we , as the european union , do now ?
after all , we know what the issue is .
thank you , commissioner .
that is the only way to create equal conditions of competition .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
finally , the commission can obviously make a commitment on its own behalf .
that is a task for the future .
i very much hope that will be one result of this .
this would be a very important position for parliament to adopt , and we will be able to vote on it tomorrow .
thank you again and i know we can find the solution together .
the debate is closed .
minister , i should like to say a special word of thanks to you for having been with us in committee and for being here today .
so once again transparency is the aim , and i believe we shall achieve that aim .
i will support this report and the commission 's amendments , but i call on the members of parliament to also support the amendments of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy on social standards .
relating to amendment no 2 :
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this decision is important but it does not go far enough .
in order for treaty reform , and indeed enlargement , to be a success it must have the full support of the people .
do you not want there to be a resolution ?
madam president , we are now discussing this directive for the second time this year , and once again , a large number of amendments have been tabled .
this is my concern on this issue .
the debate is closed .
it was the subject of difficult discussions in the council .
( applause )
we all know that .
that too would have to be taken into account .
look where we are now , more than ten years later .
the wto is a set of rules .
welcome
mr president , may i express my thanks for the strong support i have received from all the groups .
eu / us summit
a global view is required .
that is not my view .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
president , i welcome this initiative from the commission .
we will have to progress down that road but the present proposal by the rapporteur goes too far in that direction at the moment .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is the second problem .
i sense that we are going to have a whole new debate on the issue .
because it is actually true that it is certainly necessary , but also right , to promote the european model of agriculture .
