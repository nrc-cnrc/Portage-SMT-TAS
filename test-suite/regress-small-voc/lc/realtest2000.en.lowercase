they too now have a clear idea of the rights which they have to respect .
the commission cannot accept amendment no 12 .
i cannot say that today of any one country .
the information society is important to old as well as new sectors .
mr president , it is essential for us to adopt a positive approach to enlargement .
thank you .
this was absolutely vital .
thank you very much , commissioner .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it is the first time that we allow joint projects in this action programme .
the next item is the commission communication on the european research area .
mr president , thank you , commissioner , for that information .
that is the proposal before us .
the debate is closed .
the joint debate is closed .
the term in question is the word ' democracy ' .
the eu has an important task before it in this respect .
( the minutes were approved )
competition policy
the debate is closed .
i would simply like to point out that parliament was not in itself called upon to give an opinion .
let us at least agree on this objective , and if we do agree , then let us state how to achieve it .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
only then will the european institutions do justice to their task .
in addition , we want there to be a review of the administrative expenditure .
i should therefore ask both the council and the committee on budgets here in parliament to think in terms of foreign policy and not only in terms of budget strategy when they concern themselves with foreign policy .
all in all , we would like to see these amendments approved .
i turn first to parliament 's budget .
i do not have any information other than that i have already given you .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it is crucial for consumers to accept the euro .
the debate is closed .
but i have three specific comments on this programme .
let me , then , give an overall view .
i give the floor to the commissioner .
we can but congratulate them on their work .
thank you , commissioner .
i feel this is a significant statement - one that i welcome .
so individual rights and citizens ' rights are included , but also social rights .
i wish to focus on three points that have already been raised by other members here this morning .
thank you .
. i welcome this report and will vote for it .
madam president , this is the only report which i voted against .
too little progress has been made and turkey must do better .
we do not need to create competition between all these various needs but to find new resources .
question time ( council )
as they deal with the same subject , questions nos 2 and 3 will be taken together .
as regards discussions with turkey , we have just held an important debate on this issue and you are well aware of the european union 's position with regard to this matter .
it is a question of balance .
of course , we all know that the commission is working on its programme of reform .
this report was approved by a large majority in the parliamentary committee on the environment , and i shall therefore stand by the result of the committee 's vote .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
this is a major concern .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the committee on economic and monetary affairs would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
i will return to this point later .
these people are in no way responsible for the crisis , which is why the european union must show solidarity with them .
that is my commitment , for which i accept responsibility .
furthermore , there must be financial resources to help women who are victims of this situation .
this is an issue for the member states .
welcome
the debate is closed .
and that is how it should be .
mr president-in-office of the council , you have the floor .
( applause )
we can expect no better of him .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
this is not , however , going to put us off .
that is why i believe that europe must decide to act now .
i believe we will see a positive dialogue developing .
the reform of the commission is crucial to the future of our institutions .
the reports that have been presented are a move in this direction .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( parliament approved the proposal )
so well done everyone !
we set objectives for ourselves and they were achieved .
( applause )
( applause )
( applause )
i therefore believe that this is where you will find an answer to your questions .
that means it really has made quite positive progress here .
we also ask the european commission to follow this policy line in our resolution .
the debate is closed .
that is why i believe we must also improve article 4 .
we should be clear on one specific matter when we are discussing this new directive .
this is and must not become the case .
amendment no 2 :
the next item is the commission statement on the eu / us summit .
thank you very much , commissioner .
i welcome this legislation .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we can only welcome such a move .
the committee had to vote especially to ensure that this item was on the agenda for debate today .
( the minutes were approved )
