                  PORTAGEshared small voc regression suite

This small vocabulary regression corpus was generated by Howard Johnson.

It was created using a stripped-down version of the WPT 2005 system.  Training
and test sentences were picked from each WPT task where the English sentences
were made up only of the 1000 most frequent words in the English half.  The
resulting BLEU score is around 30. The entire training and testing process
takes about 50 minutes to run.  We typically use this test suite for regression
testing.

In the PORTAGEshared distribution, this directory contains both the data and
the code for the regression test suite, but the two may be separated.  All
scripts expect to find the data (the corpus in subdirectory lc/, and the
language model file europarl.en.srilm) in directory
$PORTAGE/test-suite/regress-small-voc.

Data source:
 - The corpora found in subdirectory lc/ are extracted from the corpora
   distributed by Philipp Koehn and Christof Monz for the shared tasked of the
   WPT workshop at ACL 2005.  The extracted files follow the naming convention
   of the original files, which can be found at
   http://www.statmt.org/wpt05/mt-shared-task/.  They originally come from the
   Eurparl corpus (http://people.csail.mit.edu/koehn/publications/europarl/)
   prepared by Philipp Koehn.  

 - The language model, europarl.lm.srilm, was also supplied for this shared
   task and also comes from the Europarl corpus.

Usage:

To run this test suite, type "run_all.sh <languages>", where <languages> may be
one or more of fr, de, es, and fi.  This will call all the core scripts of the
test suite in the correct order, for all the languages you selected.  You can
also run individual scripts by invoking them directly with your <languages>
choice.

Since these scripts are more intended for testing that demonstrating the code,
they are not very well documented.  It is recommended that you read the main
PORTAGEshared documentation first.  The output of these scripts ends up in many
logs and files in subdirectories called wk_<language>, and in times.txt.  When
we want to do regression testing for some code change, we typically run the
test suite twice, and do a recursive diff on the resulting wk_<language>
directories.  This usually yields many differences, so manual analysis is
unfortunately required to determine if they are desirable differences or not.
