The action plan ON THE VISITORS frontalier of Windsor provide between the other réfection of publicly funded , the implementation of Technologies introduced to facilitate the visitors of trafficking and improve the access to the border .
In September 2002 , the federal government and THE ONTARIO ANNOUNCED INVESTMENT A total of $ 300 million as to improve the approach , SIDE CRIMINAL , there frontalier Windsor-Detroit .
The CONTRIBUTION OF THE FEDERAL government has just the funds for infrastructure border patrol .
A committee joint management WAS WHEN IT WAS REVIEWING the allocation of money .
As I said earlier , the governments of Canada and Ontario have announced 27,000 may , 2003 , the NEXT THE ENTIRE ACTION PLAN ON THE VISITORS FRONTALIER OF Windsor .
The conditions of the money on infrastructure border patrol are such that only the INFRASTRUCTURE LANDMINES ARE EXPENSES .
THESE PRIVATE ARE IN LINE TO THE KYOTO agreement signed the 25 September 2002 on a investment of $ 300 million on the next five years to improve the infrastructure of the ways of approach OF THE JOB FRONTALIER SIDE criminal the border .
I am pleased that the hon. member opposite RAISED THIS ISSUE , given that the public has the feeling that transportation of marchandises way is COMPLETELY OUT FORBIDDEN on the pont Ambassador and that the camionneurs enlèvent the indicateurs of jeopardy on the marchandises way so AVOID DELAY OR DÉTOURS .
To turn BACK TO THE QUESTION the member has raised in June , the regulations to police the transportation of marchandises WAY REQUIRE transportation banned concerns , that they are transportées by traversier OR CAMION .
INDEED , the licensed of pont private required their own regulations and the blackout period is not full .
We could provide some conditions such as the type and the amount of marchandises way and the speed PERMITTED AND HOUR of the day where those marchandises go across the Pont Ambassador .
The bureaucrats customs sign the marchandises way to make ends meet the pont and to post of traverse .
Customs officers VÉRIFIENT ALWAYS IF we carries of marchandises way and if documents and a of jeopardy such THAT AFFICHES CORRESPOND to marchandises transportées .
We said no problem had been OUTLINED IN THAT REGARD .
THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT AND THE FEDERAL government Ontario day-to-day concurrent jurisdiction system could regular and éclairs of marchandises way . We concluded that it is a rare that detract the a of jeopardy .
That is not beyond the control of hasard , if I hope , but instead of effort made by THE FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL INSPECTORS and COOPERATION OF INDUSTRY .
Mr. Brian Masse :
Mr. Speaker , it is just incredible .
We have seen many reports médiatiques as a vidéo of CHAUFFEURS OF CAMION ADMIT failure enlèvent the fragmentation on their vehicles or they know people who do basis .
It is practice prevalent .
We BAY THAT we acceptons that natural dangerous remain in the DOORS OF RECRUITING OFFICES OF OUR CITIES during the hours in the vehicles that the forefront before schools , the companies and domiciles because they do not have access TO A TRAVERSIER .
That is the irony here , because this service , the only in the country , IS TRADUIRAIT BY THE BENEFITS IMMÉDIATS , but the government discrimination against in the shift pay services OFFICIALS CUSTOMS .
The government is also pay the services of brise-glace of the Coast Guard .
I want to therefore ask the PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY is really talked to his personnel .
Accepterait it come in my to talk to the people who retirent the FRAGMENTATION OF THEIR VEHICLES AND put and the community in result ?
Mr. Marcel Proulx :
Mr. Speaker , as I mentioned , the inspectors of federal governments and Ontario at basis control , and I am told , contrary to what my colleague says , IT IS NOT basis .
After our of inspectors , THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND , on the contrary , it is the same rare that this happens .
