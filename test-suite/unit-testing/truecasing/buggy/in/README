Extensions:
.txt = raw source text / final translation (post-processed) output text
.pre = pre-processed (pre-tokenization) source
.filt = post-filtering source
.tok = tokenized source / translation (after post-decoder plugin)
.dec = decoder ready source / raw decoder translation (OOV markup removed)
.dec.oov = raw decoder translation with OOV markup
.tok.oov = tokenized translation with OOV markup (after post-decoder plugin)
.pal = phrase alignments from the decoder used with truecasing
.raw = raw decoder output (with trace) for -with-ce and truecasing
.dtk = detokenized translation
pr.ce = confidence estimation

Final translation output is in P.txt
