The Windsor gateway action plan includes upgrades to the road network , along with the deployment of technologies that will facilitate the flow of traffic and enhance access to the border . 
In September 2002 , the federal and Ontario governments announced a total of $ 300 million to improve approaches on the Ontario side of the Windsor-Detroit border crossing . 
The federal portion comes from the border infrastructure fund . 
A joint management committee has been tasked to examine how the funds should be allocated . 
As I mentioned earlier , on May 27 , 2003 , the Governments of Canada and Ontario announced the next step in the implementation of the Windsor gateway action plan . 
The terms and conditions of the border infrastructure fund are such that only land based infrastructure is eligible . 
These initiatives follow the memorandum of understanding signed on September 25 , 2002 , to provide $ 300 million over the next five years to upgrade infrastructure approaches on the Ontario side of the border . 
I am actually pleased that the hon. member opposite has raised this question , as there has indeed been a public perception that dangerous goods are totally banned from the Ambassador Bridge and that truck drivers remove dangerous goods placards in order to avoid delays or detours . 
To refer to the matter the hon. member raised in June , the transportation of dangerous goods regulations require safe transportation of dangerous goods for all modes , whether the goods are being carried on a ferry or across the bridge . 
Indeed , there are private rules imposed by the owners of the privately owned bridge . 
These rules are not a total ban .  There are conditions which include the type , quantities , speeds and time of day under which one can carry dangerous goods across the Ambassador Bridge . 
Customs officials accept dangerous goods at both the bridge and ferry crossings . 
Customs officers always check whether dangerous goods are carried and whether the documents and the safety marks , such as placards , are consistent with the goods being carried . 
I have been informed that no problems have been reported . 
There is a regime of regular inspections plus occasional Transport Canada and Ontario joint transportation of dangerous goods inspection blitzes , which have shown that the removal of placards is a rare event . 
This has not occurred by accident , if the House will excuse the turn of phrase , but is the result of a great deal of work by federal and provincial inspectors , and the industry has complied . 
Mr. Brian Masse : 
Mr. Speaker , it is nothing short of incredible . 
We have had several media reports , as well as footage of truck drivers admitting to taking their placards off or to knowing people who do that on a regular basis . 
It is something that happens all the time . 
It also does not deal with the fact that we will allow those goods to sit on our city streets in lineups hour after hour in front of schools , businesses and residences because they are not diverted to the truck ferry service . 
It is ironic , because this truck ferry service could actually provide some type of benefit immediately and the government is punishing it by making it pay for customs officials , the only one in the country . 
The government also even makes them pay for the ferry ice breaking service that the U.S. Coast Guard does . 
The U.S. Coast Guard provides that service .  So I would ask the parliamentary secretary , has he actually talked to his staff ? 
Has he seen the media reports ?  Would he want to come to my community and talk to the people who are taking off the placards and putting our community at risk ? 
Mr. Marcel Proulx : 
Mr. Speaker , as I mentioned before , inspectors from the Canadian government and the Ontario government carry out regular inspections , and I am informed that this does not occur .  According to what my hon. colleague is saying , this is happening on a regular basis . 
According to our inspectors , it is not happening on a regular basis .  It is in fact rare that it happens .
