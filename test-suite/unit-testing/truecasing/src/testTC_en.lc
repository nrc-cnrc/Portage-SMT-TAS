the windsor gateway action plan includes upgrades to the road network , along with the deployment of technologies that will facilitate the flow of traffic and enhance access to the border . 
in september 2002 , the federal and ontario governments announced a total of $ 300 million to improve approaches on the ontario side of the windsor-detroit border crossing . 
the federal portion comes from the border infrastructure fund . 
a joint management committee has been tasked to examine how the funds should be allocated . 
as i mentioned earlier , on may 27 , 2003 , the governments of canada and ontario announced the next step in the implementation of the windsor gateway action plan . 
the terms and conditions of the border infrastructure fund are such that only land based infrastructure is eligible . 
these initiatives follow the memorandum of understanding signed on september 25 , 2002 , to provide $ 300 million over the next five years to upgrade infrastructure approaches on the ontario side of the border . 
i am actually pleased that the hon. member opposite has raised this question , as there has indeed been a public perception that dangerous goods are totally banned from the ambassador bridge and that truck drivers remove dangerous goods placards in order to avoid delays or detours . 
to refer to the matter the hon. member raised in june , the transportation of dangerous goods regulations require safe transportation of dangerous goods for all modes , whether the goods are being carried on a ferry or across the bridge . 
indeed , there are private rules imposed by the owners of the privately owned bridge . 
these rules are not a total ban .  there are conditions which include the type , quantities , speeds and time of day under which one can carry dangerous goods across the ambassador bridge . 
customs officials accept dangerous goods at both the bridge and ferry crossings . 
customs officers always check whether dangerous goods are carried and whether the documents and the safety marks , such as placards , are consistent with the goods being carried . 
i have been informed that no problems have been reported . 
there is a regime of regular inspections plus occasional transport canada and ontario joint transportation of dangerous goods inspection blitzes , which have shown that the removal of placards is a rare event . 
this has not occurred by accident , if the house will excuse the turn of phrase , but is the result of a great deal of work by federal and provincial inspectors , and the industry has complied . 
mr. brian masse : 
mr. speaker , it is nothing short of incredible . 
we have had several media reports , as well as footage of truck drivers admitting to taking their placards off or to knowing people who do that on a regular basis . 
it is something that happens all the time . 
it also does not deal with the fact that we will allow those goods to sit on our city streets in lineups hour after hour in front of schools , businesses and residences because they are not diverted to the truck ferry service . 
it is ironic , because this truck ferry service could actually provide some type of benefit immediately and the government is punishing it by making it pay for customs officials , the only one in the country . 
the government also even makes them pay for the ferry ice breaking service that the u.s. coast guard does . 
the u.s. coast guard provides that service .  so i would ask the parliamentary secretary , has he actually talked to his staff ? 
has he seen the media reports ?  would he want to come to my community and talk to the people who are taking off the placards and putting our community at risk ? 
mr. marcel proulx : 
mr. speaker , as i mentioned before , inspectors from the canadian government and the ontario government carry out regular inspections , and i am informed that this does not occur .  according to what my hon. colleague is saying , this is happening on a regular basis . 
according to our inspectors , it is not happening on a regular basis .  it is in fact rare that it happens .
