i am pleased that the member opposite has raised the issue , given that the government has the prevalence of our capability marchandises is fully should on pont ambassador and the camionneurs enlèvent indicateurs with the prevalence of capital marchandises are not be in the delay or détours .
to the issue that the member has raised in june , the taxation of the regulations to provide the prevalence transportation marchandises transportation and safer payments , they are transportées by traversier or by camion .
in the effect of their own private owners pont necessary regulations and the argument is not complete .
it is specific conditions such as the kind of and marchandises prevalence of as for permitted and now the day where those are the marchandises tough pont ambassador .
officials of customs sign their marchandises to meet the prevalence of two pont and to post a traverse .
the of customs officers vérifient always if carries the prevalence marchandises and if the documents and a in jeopardy such as the affiches up to marchandises transportées .
we told me that no problem is was pointed out in that regard .
the federal government departments transport and ontario their new a system that we could still regular and éclairs prevalence of marchandises . we have heard that it is a rare that we have said in jeopardy .
that is not the after the hasard , if i hope say , but instead of inspectors made efforts by the federal and provincial and cooperation of industry .

it is ironic service , because this country , is the only traduirait by the benefits immédiats , but the government in the discrimination and pay the services officials of customs .
the government is also the services to pay the brise-glace the american coast guard .

ms. judy wasylycia-leis ( winnipeg north centre , ndp ) :
mr. speaker , i am reading today to an issue that i asked the last 29 with the there may be alcoolisation foetale .
is that i am doive parliament on this issue , mr. speaker , i would like on that i raised the same question to the house to many times since april 2001 while the house was given his confident unanimous support a motion to private that i had her regarding the passage of étiquettes application to be apposées before care about the contenants of alcoholic beverages to tell that the use of alcohol during the there can pregnant seeking to alcoolisation foetale .
that is and a half years and after the government had laid to intervene and that parliament has had the commitment to canadians to take measures this matter , i am always to ask what is happening in this matter ?
why does the government did not taken steps necessary to the wishes of parliament ?
i hope the government , i will not again its balivernes manner .
i should be instead on the plan dictatorial .
i do not want to hear the balivernes our dictature .
i would like measures that are taken on this issue that is very chère canadians , an issue of concern many people who live with that there are alcoolisation syndrome as all members of their families , their friends and their who know exactly promoters of what we are .
we are a problem extremely costly for contribuable , because of the government 's inaction .
there is a alcoolisation foetale , the future , that we can actually engendre costs of approximately $ 1 million per child time .
how can we the future ?
in persuadant women not to not to alcohol during pregnant .
one of ways to use to do that will be to the implementation of étiquettes care about the bouteilles .
that is what we have done other jurisdictions .
many other governments see that as a matter of political the public interest .
our neighbours of south demand that all of contenants alcohol alcoolisée arborent an application care of this kind of the ceo of the public health .
producers in on alcohol vin keg and canadians are not is not had of these products will étiquettes on their ?
what we are doing is that the government has to say to her clearly brasseurs , to the industry and have to be a little distilleries action to be greatly wants to share their entire community .
this is a measure that it is absolutely contribuable anything to do , which will not the earnings like corporate an individual , but that will déterminante to fight against the there to alcoolisation foetale in our society .
i know what i can add to see the government and draw the attention .
the parliament to go back to the unanimously a motion on the subject .
the support of revealed that 90 % of canadians are in favour of this résolument a simple the money .
in the corporate pédiatrie associations medical from alberta and labrador , as others have players written time and again to know why we tardait to compete in this matter .

however , we continue to consult the most research and reliable to consider the input of experts in this area .
our goal is to implementing measures that use the most reach our resources and who will get to all helpful purposes , some positive results .
the government of canada has been proactif in response to his question raised by the tsaf .
in 1999 , the funding was amount of $ 11 might for the scope and the number of projects communautaires under the program fashion , the canadian prénatale pcnp .
we have given a funding at the beginning of on in the raising awareness and prevention of the public , the heckling from getting the development of practices pcnp for the tools to the what a funds to help projects building a website used to tsaf , to the surveillance , to the proper and to the with .
the funding has also served in the early , the diagnoses identification and to the training , a manuel incluant the development of training , called `` has manual saturday end community caring '' .

this kind of dictature is unacceptable .
what happens here this government ?
