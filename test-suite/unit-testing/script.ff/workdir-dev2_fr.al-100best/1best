mr. speaker , i am pleased that i , as my colleague , the house to support this bill , and i agree with the interpretation that he made in its last speech .
i do not want to correct what the member has said in his remarks them , but on a point of view somewhat different .
in its lot , he said that the information would be fully available for the government .
he has given the example of its own family that could 101 , things on its ancêtres .
it is perfectly right on this .
but the purpose of compromise between 92 years after 112 years is not help families who would be getting information on his past .
it is to reflect the cases where a family would like to get information on the past another family .
as legislators , we have to pay again on this issue .
is that under the 's pertaining to privacy recruits in line with the . that is why i would argue that a professional to use , if i can tell , 92 years is a good for .
it should have to have procedures to access to information until , 92 years after 112 years , the information would be easy to access to the government .
i want to note that the member is that , as legislators , our role is not the preventing the access to information on his family .
a in general , it is to protect the privacy of individuals who may , the information on their privacy never be allowed to private .
the deputy speaker :
the hon. member alluded to give the , i just remind the house that the period of government orders was severe have seven minutes , because of the time to a question given earlier in day .
we terminerons the government orders to 18 p.m. 37 this evening .
the member for south shore has the floor .
mr. gerald keddy :
mr. speaker , i want to thank the member for his question .
in fact , it was more a statement that a question and i am absolutely agreement his declaration .
i have no trouble agree with the fact that 92 years is a reasonable period of time for most of the information contained in the census records of concern .
i guess even more it and i would say that we did not need some additional 20 years beyond at that time .
after 92 years , to be a period of 20 years and the 112 years , it is opinion .
however , if it apaise the ever-present or meets the questions that members of substantive or of members of the people have on this , so i do not have problem , nor will .
after 112 years of stockage in their of information which are not private , if it to start , it would not be released great concern is about the government .
i am absolutely agree with the hon. member .
mr. brian masse ( windsor west , ndp ) :
mr. speaker , i am pleased , on behalf of the new democratic party , to support the bill s-13 .
i would say that the bill as and correcting a situation data for longstanding sour referred to the pension act .
the bill is also a model for the treatment of the census records .
it was important the report .
the census records are not only in the reasons for historical and genealogical , but also because they impact on the decisions that are now in this country .
the globe and mail article today released a called `` the statistics census permits ottawa value of a billion dollars '' .
section irreparable being in the census returns from the last year .
the rearrangement funds is by by the results census .
these results impact on the social policy , decisions affecting the government spending and the legislation that all of good things that déterminent services that the country where the company people .
bill s-13 attempts to allow the legal ambiguity this in terms of census records made over the years 1910 to 2003 .
it would provide genealogists and historical researchers to the experts to consult census records are , under certain conditions , for a period of 20 years enable 92 years after the census .
the important , and we sometimes downward from is is that the bill also foundation which is the conditions appliqueront starting with the 2003 and that we will , as citizens , to decide whether we consentons éclairée way to the release of census information as .
i want to talk about a briefly now and i have to be addressed in the points out , including the lockheed martin , which is one of the most important manufacturers multinationaux an arms , to the how of information .
this is not even a company in canada .
there is due to wonder if canadians will trust him enough for him to not only information concerning their age , but also starved sex and other issues concerning their phenomenon of life , the same information to be by the following the decision to decisions .
as far as this amendment , genealogists or their representatives should redouble to address the rumoured to do that information would base members on their own family , as name , including the age , marital status , or the date , sex , in connection with the leader of the family or her family , the situation in the country , instead of status , in the case of a immigrant , the year its in canada , or the employment become .
it is very important that people can things released canadian forces .
it is not a rare that people wanting to their member to look at things their family history of the reasons for health reasons , historical with their status or reasons we to them in their antécédents , cultural history and the same information that were used inaccessibles and now we want to available .
this is the reasonable compromise which are reached the experts who talked about this issue very sensitive respecting the protection of privacy .
before begin their business would that the experts for historical research are confirming the terms of their public and scientific research goes through their peers or some of their sommités contaminants .
as i said , only the basic information to be revealed .
if the conditions appliqueraient for a period of 20 years enable 92 years after the census .
it in the 112 years , the conditions publications , and access to information and they would be given to under any condition .
the period before 112 years can sembler long .
i hope that all those who are here and vivront until 112 years and they have a lifetime long and prospère .
this is not the case of everyone .
it could be that some people in their sign their that the information released , but on the other members of the majority their families are on the data communiquées .
this is a very sensitive issue for a family members .
i know that i have to conclude , mr. speaker .
the deputy speaker :
the member anticipé my involvement .
that is clôt period s. today to the government orders .
the member for windsor west will be some 15,000 minutes when bill s-13 figurera again order date of the business of the house .
adjournment proceedings
the adjourn the house is to have proposed in the standing order 38 deemed .

mr. brian masse ( windsor west , ndp ) :
mr. speaker , i see the floor in the house of commons to argue again because of the city of windsor and its frontalier there .
there are over a year , the government creates a plan with ontario and announced funds $ 300 million .
then , he put up to a committee of 60,000 days and it took over a year to the committee to bring it was known as a plan nine issues .
my question is on the today , at the city of windsor had an action plan as a access , but it is a problem .
on approximately 100,000 trucks transportant prevalence of contents traversent .44 the border each year enfreignant at the time to canadian laws and american .
given that statistics from the province of ontario .
despite the and security for the ministers of finance industry and did not get semblé undertake on this issue .
we have a there frontalier for the contents prevalence of windsor and that is the traversier of trucks windsor-detroit that we have to be a pré-autorisation .
that is the only of the country where the data apply are on the contents prevalence before the embarquement traversier on the vehicles .
in fact this service of traversier received a $ host ridge under the legislation on american security at home because of its activities .
there has been no of problems in 14 years .
what is quite is that many trucks transportant prevalence of contents members and the pont ambassador contreviennent with the american legislation .
the government did absolutely no into account the service of traversier in its regarding the plan will frontalier , in spite of the fact that it could be the transportation phenomenon of the more rapidly less onéreux , and the most important again , to some of the most a equal matériaux franchissant the borders .
recently , an act to camion gasoline has explosé over i-75 detroit , at the michigan .
this could also have up on pont ambassador .
there is no of security .
the trucks empruntent directly this pont and any what can be .
the frustration ressentie in my area is linked to the fact that some are the program in nine issues that the government has put in place , but the consensus on that they may not have not light on .
one has with respect to what a facility for which prétraitement serviraient to allow the trucks .
the second on the service of traversier .
there is also about passages for piétons and various other things .
unfortunately , we have had a tragedy resulted recently with the death of a residing on on heron church .
is that it has made campaign in in mind that passed along to the litigieux , the government will bouger in the case of things and that i consensus soulignés .
it should be highlighted the minister of industry is accomplishments come before the committee on industry .
he said that ignores with a whole .
he said that the government could not have the facility for prétraitement , that is what other because it was dérouler is the same time and that nothing bougerait in the case as he did not have met with new provincial ministers . that is more , there was municipal election .
not later that last week , the minister for international cooperation and essex said that the member that we proposed implement measures in use with and that of operations were in the .
we do not know where the government is the leadership us .
i would like to know why the government should go to the united states and enfreindre legislation to implement these people in the lives of my area by sheltering circulating patrol in our trucks transportant prevalence of contents of members of the pont .44 .
the government is not enough money to restore kicking the trucks to tough to places force .
why are we can be on the items in consensus ?
it says that today , since the september 11 2001 , there was in that area frontalier over 100 million .
mr. marcel proulx ( parliamentary secretary to the minister of transport , lib. ) :
mr. speaker , at the outset , i wish to reassure canadians most clearly possible them saying that there is no marchandise dangerous acheminée .44 on pont ambassador .
yes , the government decided to make significant infrastructure improvements to the border . the stakeholders deals with some of these works at local and are very long .
the government of canada and the ontario have recently announced in the next behind the implementation of action plan regarding the will frontalier of windsor . they conservatives recognize the importance and economic renovation needed to improve the approach to post frontaliers .
the federal government is committed to be part of the infrastructure funding for the big business border to improve the infrastructure to post frontaliers out of windsor area .
