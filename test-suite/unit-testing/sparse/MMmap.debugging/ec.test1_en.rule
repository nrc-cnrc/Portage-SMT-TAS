cities and communities 
in march 2005 , the document municipal actions to reduce mercury was published in order to help municipalities manage mercury-containing products and mercury sources found in their community . 
the document provides guidance on how to develop a municipal mercury elimination policy and plan that will appropriately direct efforts to reduce mercury releases . 
there are several municipalities looking at community-based programs for reducing mercury in landfills and wastewater , like the ecosuperior program in thunder bay . 
some municipalities have also developed sewer use by-laws to limit mercury releases from certain facilities such as dental practices .

what is the issue ? 
canada ' forest industry is a major contributor to the economy . 
in 2004 , total shipment of forest products exceeded $ 80 billion , including $ 44.7 billion in export . 
despite tough economic challenges , canada 's forest industry has made many improvements in environmental performance over the past 15 years . 
since 1990 , canada 's pulp and paper mills have spent over $ 6 billion on environmental improvements . 
much work has gone into achieving these results , but more remains to be done to improve environmental performance while increasing competitiveness and meeting the ever more stringent demands of customers , communities and regulators . 
halons are organic , synthetic ( i.e. , human-made ) chemicals . 
they are found in fire protection applications , because bromine within the halon molecule increases the molecule 's ability to fight fires . 
bromotrifluoromethane has a high ozone-depleting potential ( odp ) ; thus , it is identified as an ozone-depleting substance ( ods ) .

what is the purpose of these guidelines ? 
the purpose of these guidelines is to protect public health by reducing releases of ethylene oxide ( a known carcinogen ) to the environment from facilities that have sterilization services . 
these guidelines , developed by environment canada , do not address occupational exposure , which is dealt with by the provinces . 
environment canada is considering reducing ethylene oxide 's npri reporting threshold to 10 kg , thus making the reporting of ethylene oxide releases by the health care sector mandatory through the npri . 
further details on the npri and its requirements can be found on their website at : http://www.ec.gc.ca/pdb/npri/npri_home_e.cfm 
when do the guidelines have to be implemented ? 
the costs associated with these upgrades will also vary according to the specifications of your sterilizer and emission control system . 
your equipment supplier can provide information on what this will cost for your facility . 
the evaluation found additional evidence of attempts to develop strategic implementation plans within three of the department 's five regions . 
those regional plans include identification of priority species and activities . 
one area where the department has clearly organized itself for success concerns the habitat stewardship program . 
the department has put in place appropriate and robust governance and operational structures ( at the interdepartmental , departmental and regional levels ) , and strategic plans with identified priorities , procedures , and measurement and reporting systems . 
a culture of continuous learning is observed within the program and , as a result , the habitat stewardship program has contributed to a wide range of species recovery initiatives and continues to be highly respected by stakeholders and partners .

the ccme does not impose its suggestions on its members since it does not have the authority to implement or enforce legislation ; each jurisdiction decides whether or not to adopt ccme proposals . 
the ccme is made up of environment ministers from federal , provincial and territorial governments . 
these 14 ministers normally meet twice a year to discuss national environmental priorities and determine work to be carried out under the auspices of the ccme . 
since 1986 , the mandate of this task group has been to develop , approve and publish national water quality guidelines . 
it is also currently identifying « indicators » to measure the health of the ecosystem .

under subsection 17(2) of the regulations , a primary supplier could elect before december 1 , 1998 to use alternative ( higher ) limits for the ben . 
these alternative limits are based on the historical composition of the primary supplier ’s gasoline , thereby reflecting its historical ben number . 
there is no expiry date for alternative ben limits , although a primary supplier may rescind the alternative limit at any time . 
a supplier rescinding its alternative limit would then be subject to the normal limits for ben .

this reduction was brought about by a memorandum of understanding between environment canada and most domestic refiners on providing low sulphur diesel fuel for on-road uses at the retail level . 
the implementation of the federal diesel fuel regulations ( 1997 ) , which became effective in 1998 for all on-road uses , is expected to further reduce that average . 
in 1997 , the average sulphur level for on-road diesel and regular ( off-road ) diesel were 300 ppm and 2400 ppm respectively . 
chaired by environment canada , the gwg consisted of representatives from four other federal departments ( health canada ; industry canada ; transport canada ; and natural resources canada ) and six provincial governments ( ontario ; québec ; new brunswick ; nova scotia ; british columbia ; and alberta ) . 
the gwg based its deliberations primarily on the work of the expert panels and the fact-finding group on vehicle/fuel compatibility , but also considered some additional information .

notice of intent on cleaner vehicles , engines and fuels - fuels agenda 
on february 19 , 2001 , environment minister david anderson announced the government 's 10 year plan of action for cleaner vehicles , engines and fuels , an integral part of the government of canada 's clean air strategy . 
the plan of action contains several measures aimed at protecting the health and environment of canadians by improving the quality of fuels . 
establishing a new limit for sulphur in off-road diesel fuel ( eg. used in construction and agricultural equipment ) ; 
establishing a comprehensive database of gasoline and diesel fuel quality ; reducing the level of sulphur in light fuel oils used for heating homes and for heavy fuel oils used by industrial facilities . 
the report examines regulations , voluntary initiatives and economic instruments as they are applied to diesel in oecd countries . 
the situation in four countries is reviewed to gain insight from their experiences in applying measures to accelerate market shifts to lower sulphur diesel . based on this work , a set of observations is put forward .

there are many ways to produce energy , each one drawing on an equally diverse selection of earth resources . 
in the past 40 years , annual temperatures in the western arctic have climbed by 1.5°c , while those over the central arctic have warmed by 0.5°c . 
the arctic has some special features that make it an important focus for climate research . 
physically , the arctic islands are entirely snow-covered for more than half the year , and the region contains mountain glaciers , ice caps and extensive areas of permafrost . 
arctic waters are also covered with sea ice for most of the year . 
changes in the amount of sunshine are extreme since the arctic experiences periods of 24-hour sunlight and 24-hour darkness at different times of year .

figure 3 : changes in the permafrost as measured at this monitoring site near alert , nunavut , can affect buildings , roads and airstrips . 
several projects compiled data from various sources and then studied the information to improve our understanding of the arctic climate system . 
researchers reactivated permafrost temperature monitoring sites at key locations in the arctic . 
initial analysis of data retrieved from the field indicates considerable ground temperature variability at various depths between sites and from year to year during the 1990s . 
ozone ozone is a naturally occurring gas , formed from normal oxygen , that protects the earth by filtering out ultraviolet radiation from the sun .

as president of the conference of the parties , minister ambrose will be traveling to bonn next week for a meeting of the subsidiary bodies to the united nations framework convention on climate change and the kyoto protocol , where discussions will be held on shaping a more inclusive and effective international approach to addressing climate change . 
realistic , results-oriented approach to climate change 
in 2004 , canadian emissions were almost 35 % above canada 's kyoto target . 
it is open to all 189 countries under the united nations framework convention on climate change including all major greenhouse gas emitters .

new facilities using cleaner fuels and technologies will have a three year grace period . 
because it always takes a few years to get a new plant running efficiently , this grace period will allow new facilities to reach full production and to establish their initial emissions levels . 
several options will allow companies to choose the most cost-effective way to meet their reduction targets and can encourage innovation and the adoption of cleaner technologies . 
these options include : 
in-house reductions : such as energy efficiency measures , improved energy management systems , or investments in carbon capture and storage or other emission-reducing technologies . 
this will all be finalized by fall 2007 . 
what measures are you putting in place to help industry achieve their goals ? 
industry can comply by making in-house changes to their processes , or by investing in new equipment or technology . 
a domestic emissions trading system will also be introduced for sulphur oxides ( sox ) and nitrogen oxides ( nox ) . 
this flexible approach will ensure we protect the environment , clean up the air we breathe and strengthen our position to address transboundary air pollution while canada 's economy can continue to grow and prosper . 
the government will introduce canada-wide emissions trading systems for sulphur oxides ( sox ) , nitrogen oxides ( nox ) , and greenhouse gases . 
how will the emissions trading mechanism for greenhouse gases work ? 
indeed , the greenhouse gas reduction targets agreed to by the previous government called for canada to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by six per cent below 1990 levels beginning in 2008 . 
climate change is a global issue that requires global solutions . 
our actions at home will be the basis for future international cooperative efforts to address climate change .

the rebound effect describes the increased use of a more efficient product resulting from the implied decrease in the price of use : for example , a more efficient car is cheaper to drive and so people may drive more . 
in response to a request from the nrtee , environment canada provided explanatory information on the assumptions and methodologies used to determine the expected emissions reductions resulting from the measures in the statement . 
however , even with this information , there are cases where the nrtee has had to make further assumptions about the methodological approaches used , or cases where assumptions have been used to calculate contrasting emissions scenarios . these are identified as much as possible without delving into unnecessary detail . in several instances in the plan , differing accounting standards are used to describe the emissions reductions accruing from a particular initiative .

chile-canada cooperation 
a delegation from chile visited british columbia for two weeks as part of a cooperative agreement between canada and chile to exchange information on environmental concerns relating to mining and mine closures . 
the chileans are developing legislation for the mining industry and were interested in learning how canada 's regulations are implemented . 
ec 's consultations with other science departments needs improvement , averaging input from only one other department per project . 
increased attention to the environmental assessment of policies and programs . 
environment canada is actively collaborating with the agency and others to determine the effectiveness of screenings , comprehensive studies and panels , and to better understand departmental follow-up with respect to mitigation and monitoring . 
we will develop departmental guidance in the areas of pipelines , wildlife areas , and a manual for assisting ea practitioners in writing and reviewing ea documents . 
several legal challenges will reshape the way we do business . 
the federal government has released its response to the report of the terra nova project environmental assessment panel on the terra nova offshore development which recommended approval of the project , subject to various recommendations . 
one of the key recommendations was for the proponent to follow a precautionary approach , which means that development should proceed with the application of prudent foresight , recognizing uncertainty , and erring on the side of caution when decisions must be taken where knowledge is incomplete . 
such an approach will include the use of site specific environmental assessments , pilot projects , careful impact monitoring , cautious interpretation of data and adaptive management . 
the ec team that contributed to the government response are to be congratulated , not only for presenting our traditional issues of concern , but also for emphasizing the need for a precautionary approach to this important development . 
contribute to informed decision-making for the purpose of sustaining the environment for the benefit of present and future generations .

linking the indicators to society and the economy 
conclusion 
the health of canadians and their social and economic well-being are highly dependent on the quality of their environment . 
one way to assess environmental quality is to use indicators that convey complex information in a simple form . 
the canadian environmental sustainability indicators provide an indication of the health of our environment in much the same way as the gross domestic product ( gdp ) and other measures provide a sense of the health of the economy . 
the pm2.5 exposure indicator showed no statistically significant increasing or decreasing trends , either nationally or regionally between 2000 and 2005 . 
the highest pm2.5 concentrations were measured at stations in southern ontario and southern quebec in 2005 . 
why is it important ? 
note : the trend line represents an average rate of change of 0.8 % per year . 
from 1990 to 2005 , the indicator shows a statistically significant increase of 12 % ( plus or minus 10 percentage points , resulting in an increase ranging from 2 % to 22 % at a 90 % confidence level ) . 
how is it delivered ? 
the ieyc program is managed and funded by ec but delivered by the environmental careers organization canada ( eco ) . eco reviews and approves internship applications from environmental companies , maintains a database of applications from canadian youth , matches qualified youth , and reports to ec. 
progress and opportunities 
the ieyc was created initially as a two-year program starting in april 1997 and sunsetting in march 1999 . 
the government of canada renewed the yes in 1998 .

another key aspect of the plan is the climate fund which will operate as a canada environmental bank . 
if you provide reductions of greenhouse gas emissions , then you will receive credits for them . 
you can sell your credits to the market and make money with it . 
i would be pleased to discuss with all of you the way it will work . 
but certainly if you come with initiatives for transportation it is something that we can discuss further . 
of the overall $ 138.7m in project funding for this year , almost $ 100m will be distributed among northern sites . 
i am releasing today the list of these 97 sites , with , for each of them , the federal departement responsible for its remediation . 
for the northwest territories , you will find listed : colomac mine , silver bear mines , tundra-taurcanis mine , discovery mine , axe point , atkinson point , port radium mine and last but not least , exactly where we are today : giant mine . 
giant mine : after 50 years of operation , there are approximately 237,000 tonnes of highly toxic arsenic trioxide stored underground . 
in addition , arsenic-contaminated buildings,soils , and tailings on the site represent hazards to human health and the environment . there is potential for the release of arsenic dust from contaminated sources on the surface . 
other impacts include deforestation , soil erosion , depletion of fish stocks , scarcity of food , a reduction of land and water resources and so on and so forth . 
scientists tell us that what we need is kyoto ten times over . 
so every time you hear someone say , " i have done enough , i'm doing better than most people , " tell him , " there is still more you can do . " 
each of us must put his or her shoulder to the wheel . 
so who has to make an effort ? 
on the basis of these meetings , here is what we propose to put on the table at the major montreal conference . 
this initiative can be summarized as the three " i"s . 
this works well in english , not so well in french . 
the three " i"s are " implementation " of the kyoto protocol , " improvement " and " innovation . " 
canada has worked very hard to ensure that all goes well .

environment minister in p.e.i. to discuss climate change and economic opportunities 
a regulatory approach to reducing greenhouse gases from large industrial emitters was highlighted as one of the commitments moving forward on climate change , last april and demonstrates the government 's commitment project green , to enhance canada 's economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability . 
this action of putting ghgs on schedule 1 of cepa also supports the government moving forward on a host of issues under the climate change plan which contains measures for all canadians and all sectors to do their part in meeting canada 's 270 megatonne reduction goal . 
- the expansion of the one tonne challenge program which encourages action from all canadians to play their role at home , at work and at leisure . 
the final order for ghgs will be published in the canada gazette part ii november 30 , 2005 . 
the response to comments report has been posted on environment canada 's website at http://www.ec.gc.ca/ceparegistry/documents/part/ghg_sched1/response.cfm . 
the government of canada will release a consultation draft soon that will set the out regulation elements . 
the government of canada 's actions on climate change are a component of project green .

canada and morocco sign memorandum of understanding on clean development mechanism initiatives 
montreal , december 8 , 2005 - the government of canada signed a memorandum of understanding with morocco today that will see both countries work together in support of new clean development mechanism ( cdm ) projects . 
canadian companies are becoming increasingly interested in cooperating on cdm initiatives with the moroccan government . 
the country 's stability and its efforts to create a favourable climate for cdm projects have made it a destination of choice for many overseas investors in this sector . 
notes for an address by the honourable david anderson , p.c. , m.p. minister of the environment on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the international institute for environment and development 
the adoption of the tobacco products information regulations in june 2001 made it mandatory for tobacco manufacturers to list benzene , formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide , in addition to tar , nicotine and carbon monoxide , on the packages . 
health canada recently launched a national public health education campaign focusing on six highly dangerous chemicals including formaldehyde . 
health canada is helping canadians learn more about the toxins , and about its new regulation , by distributing over 1.5 million information leaflets to doctors , dentists and hospitals across the country . 
this would bring the emission controls in line with the u.s. standards . 
pollution prevention plan can be an effective tool and do not preclude other action , if necessary in the future 
environment canada will pursue development of environmental performance agreements , or other appropriate voluntary instruments , to address voc emissions from products used in printing and publishing operations . 
due to the variety of operations in this sector , environment canada will initially develop a strategy for federal action which will include careful consideration of initiatives by the u.s. epa and the california air resources board in the areas of lithographic printing materials , flexible package printing materials , letterpress printing materials and paper , film and foil coatings . 
the strategy will be determined by 2005 and actions identified in place by 2009 . 
government notices federal agenda on the reduction of emissions of volatile organic compounds from consumer and commercial products 
environment canada will also review existing voluntary agreements to which it is a partner and identify , by 2005 , any which could usefully be modified to address voc-containing products . 
for the purpose of these guidelines , sterilizers in healthcare facilities are considered non-commercial sterilizers . 
the main requirements of the guidelines include : 
reducing emissions of ethylene oxide during the sterilization cycle by 99 % . 
this is normally achieved by installing pollution control equipment in order to treat emissions of ethylene oxide released during the sterilization cycle . 
your supplier of sterilization equipment or a consultant can provide information on the pollution control equipment available and suitable for your system and facility . 
the purchase and installation of the pollution control equipment will vary depending on the type of pollution control equipment required and your installation . 
your equipment supplier can provide information on what this will cost for your facility . 
the operating costs of the pollution control equipment will also vary .

opportunities for voc reductions in printing 
actions to reduce voc emissions from printing operations 
employing over 80000 people in more than 5000 establishments across the country i , the canadian printing and publications industry plays a major role in the canadian economy . 
it is impossible to pass a single day in today 's society without coming into contact with products from the industry . 
newspapers , books , flyers , wallpaper , plastic bags , food wrappers and pop cans are all products that will typically pass though a printer at some point in their lifecycle . 
the primary source of voc emissions within a printing plant is the press-room where there are three main sources of vocs : 
ink - many of the inks used in printing are solvent based . 
with solvent based inks the evaporation of the solvents ( many of which are vocs ) acts to dry the ink to the substrate . 
the amount of solvent emitted from the drying ink varies from around 5 % for a non-heatset lithographic process to 100 % for flexographic on plastic or heatset lithographic 
the cleanprint project also provided auditing services to help printers identify areas of potential improvement .

the electricity generation sector consists of combustion emissions associated with electricity generation and steam production for mainly residential , commercial and manufacturing use . 
894 
in 2000 , electricity and petroleum industries contributed 36 % or 264 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent* ( mt co2 eq ) of canada 's total greenhouse gas emissions of 726 mt. both the petroleum and electricity production contributed 136 mt and 128 mt of emissions , respectively . 
on a sub-sector basis , upstream petroleum emissions accounted for the majority of the petroleum industry sector emissions ( 113 mt , or 85 % of the sector total ) , while downstream petroleum contributed 21 mt. 
3 includes combustion and process emissions associated with the refining of crude oil . 
4 a small proportion of emissions from the upstream petroleum industry is accounted for in the mining sector due to data limitations . 
the downstream petroleum industry includes the refining of crude oil and the distribution of natural gas .

emissions from stationary combustion activities increased by about 176 % ( 8.7 mt ) , due largely to increased demand for natural gas ( by 242 % or 175 pj ) and ngls ( by 280 % or 15 pj ) ( statistics canada , # 57-003 ) . 
fugitive emissions of ch4 from underground coal mines decreased by 48 % between 1990 and 2003 , due largely to mine closures in the maritime provinces . 
a10.1 introduction 
from an economic standpoint , since 1990 , the canadian chemical manufacturing industry has continued to expand , with sector gdp growing over 19 % . 
chemical product demand between 2002 and 2003 increased , resulting in a 4 % increase in gdp ( informetrica limited and statistics canada ) . 
while production has increased at the sole adipic acid production plant in canada since 1990 , the installation of an emission abatement system at this facility in 1997 resulted in a 9.6 mt ( or 90 % ) reduction in process-related n2o emissions over the 1990-2003 period . 
conversely , process emissions associated with the production of ammonia and nitric acid increased 23 % and 3.7 % , respectively , since 1990 .

with respect to the transport sector , a major recalculation was performed for the entire time series for domestic aviation estimates due to the incorporation of flight activity data within the fuel allocation methodology . 
as a result , domestic air transport fuel consumption data and associated emissions were revised downwards ( and , conversely , emissions from international aviation [ bunkers ] were revised upwards ) . 
in addition , the update of the original spreadsheet - based mgem to the relational database ( ms access ) mgem 05 has resulted in minor shifts between on - road and off-road fuel allocations and the associated emissions throughout the entire time series . 
mgem 05 also has improved data handling capacity , which accommodates updated vehicle population data sets for 2001 and 2002 , leading to further recalculations for the 2001 and 2002 transport estimates . 
finally , for the fugitive oil and gas emissions , a correction to the spreadsheet links induced recalculations for the 2000-2002 time series for light and medium oil production .

may 2008 
in 1992 , a multi-stakeholder advisory committee was created to advise on the formation of the national pollutant release inventory ( npri ) program . 
the npri is the only legislated , nation-wide , publicly accessible inventory of its type in canada . 
2.5 criteria air contaminants / thresholds sub-group 
prior to 2000 , all substances listed in the npri had common reporting criteria : 10 tonnes manufactured , processed or otherwise ( mpo ) used at a concentration of 1 % or more , except for by-products . 
this is known as the conventional mpo threshold . 
in addition to the requirement of mpo threshold , a facility would have reported the substance to the npri only if the 20,000-hour employee threshold was met . 
since that time , a number of substances have been added to the npri at alternate thresholds ( ath ) ( over 90 substances ) . 
this framework evolved into a proposal document tabled at the npri consultation meeting in september 2004 and at that time , wg members agreed to use the framework as a working document . 
at the wg meeting in june 2006 , ec proposed to the wg the option of utilizing a " reversible " air dispersion modeling technique to determine the appropriate reporting thresholds for category 3 substances as defined in the ath framework . 
as a result , the wg re-convened the ath sg , whose mandate is to examine the concept of an ath framework in a broader context , including the modeling component . 
2.6.2 sg status 
the tors for the sg were approved by the wg at the november 2006 meeting . 
the sg has met through several conference calls since november 2006 and is at reviewing and updating the 2004 ath framework document . 
during the june 2007 wg conference call , ec stated that after preliminary work on " reversible " air dispersion modeling , and in light of stakeholder comments , it has decided to reassess its proposed approach for establishing alternative thresholds . 
ec proposed that it would perform additional internal work on ath issues , before presenting the sg with a detailed revised path forward .

for this reason , the exemption is consistent with the requirements for reporting emissions under the ontario moe regulation . 
the wg encourages ec to work with ontario moe to encourage harmonization at the selected npri threshold . 
environment canada accepts the consensus work group recommendation for listing hexavalent chromium compounds separately from chromium and its compounds at an alternative threshold for hexavalent chromium compounds . 
environment canada has opted for a threshold of 50 kg and a 0.1 % concentration exemption for hexavalent chromium compounds .

within the federal government : to institutionalize pollution prevention across all federal government activities ; 
with other governments : to foster a national pollution prevention effort ; 
with the private sector : to achieve a climate in which pollution prevention becomes a major consideration in industrial activities ; 
with all canadians : to provide access to the information and tools necessary to implement pollution prevention practices ; and 
with the international community : to participate in international pollution prevention initiatives . 
pollution prevention focuses on avoiding the creation of pollutants rather than trying to manage them after they have been created . 
the federal government defines pollution prevention as : 
the use of processes , practices , materials , products , substances or energy that avoid or minimize the creation of pollutants and waste , and reduce overall risk to human health or the environment .

now , the federal government is delivering on this promise . 
this strategy stresses the need to make pollution prevention a part of our everyday activities and decisions whether as governments , as companies , as communities , or as individuals . 
it shows how we can shift the focus of environmental protection from reacting to pollution towards prevention of pollution at the source .

fish population surveys are used to monitor fish in the receiving waters where mills discharge effluent , and to compare them to fish from a reference area not exposed to mill effluent . 
in both cycles , such comparisons showed statistically significant differences in at least one of three key measurements at the majority of sites , and about half the mills reported differences in all three . 
smart roads are safe roads 
each year , approximately 300 canadians are killed and 11 000 injured in road accidents in which snow and ice are a major cause — more than the annual total for all accidents involving all other modes of transportation . 
this proactive approach to winter road maintenance is known as " anti-icing " . 
the long period of darkness leading up to the sunrise enabled scientists to monitor changes in the gaseous components of the air and snow before and after the event , using sophisticated methods such as mass spectrometry and laser-induced fluorescence . 
furthermore , recent satellite observations made over the region at the same time of year found increased levels of bromine oxide — a reactive form of bromine that is produced when bromine destroys ozone . 
scientists also found that mercury depletion in the atmosphere in the arctic closely follows ozone depletion . this is of particular importance with regard to human and environmental health , as this toxic chemical may be falling back to earth and entering the food chain . 
the expedition observed increased levels of nitrogen oxide ( nox ) being emitted from the snow after sunrise . 
nox is produced by the burning of fossil fuels , converted into other chemicals in the atmosphere , and eventually washed back down to earth . 
among their findings was the discovery that most migrants were more closely associated with breeding populations to the west of them rather than to the east . 
for example , hudsonian godwits on fall migration in saskatchewan were genetically more similar to birds from the mackenzie delta than from churchill , manitoba . 
similarly , red-necked phalaropes captured on fall migration in saskatchewan were more closely linked to birds from prudhoe bay , alaska , rather than churchill . 
the site , which has been under development since 1998 , enables users to learn about some of this research , and provides access to a wealth of information on wildlife . 
visitors to the site can search from either a species or spaces perspective . 
a species search provides links to detailed information on 431 species of canadian birds , including colour photos , life history , sound bytes of calls , range and breeding area maps , and research activities . 
canadian and american scientists with the arctic goose joint venture gathered information on the species ' population dynamics , and recommended stabilizing the population by 2002 . 
to achieve this , the group recommended doubling the current rate of harvest to about 24 per cent of the population per year by implementing a spring conservation hunt , increasing quotas , and permitting the use of electronic calls , baiting , and lure crops . 
as a result , canada , the u.s. and mexico agreed to amend regulations in staging and wintering areas to allow the species to be controlled for conservation purposes . 
to learn more about on-site methods of removing oil from such mixed sediments , an international team of scientists staged an experimental spill on a remote arctic island some 800 kilometres north of norway . 
the experiment was conceived and coordinated by environment canada and sponsored by spill response agencies from canada , the united states , the united kingdom , sweden , and norway . 
there the information from many sensors in the network is integrated to determine the location of the strike , in some areas to within half a kilometre . 
eventually , the two areas build up to such a point that a flash of electric current jumps across the gap . 
although the network is still too new to identify any long-term trends , scientists are hopeful that these data will help to determine which areas of the country are most or least likely to encounter thunderstorms — and how lightning activity is affected by other weather - and climate-related factors . 
in the future , more sensors may also be added to locations above the treeline in order to better define lightning activity in more northern remote areas .

for example , the department has a memorandum of understanding with the united states environmental protection agency to conduct collaborative r&d . 
environment canada is committed to exploring means by which alternative service delivery , where appropriate , can help to deliver s&t programs and activities . recently , the department has encouraged the development of several alternative s&t program and service delivery mechanisms , including the canadian environmental technology advancement centre ; the government-owned , contractor-operated wastewater technology centre ; and the undertaking of an extensive study of alternative delivery options for the department 's atmospheric environment program . 
opportunities for alternative s&t program delivery will continue to be explored by environment canada , particularly for laboratory services . 
mechanisms currently being examined by the department include joint federal-provincial laboratory programs , joint federal-federal laboratory services , private sector access to environment canada laboratories , and the development of research consortia or other joint ventures .

implementing the plan and measuring our progress 
the science plan has set out a mission to guide environment canada 's science . 
it has identified broad areas where that science will be needed in the coming years , and outlined three strategic directions to realize the mission and contribute to departmental and government priorities . 
they are the single most important contributor to the success of the department and the science plan . 
managing a scientific and technical workforce involves many different elements : successfully recruiting well-trained people , retaining them in positions useful to the department , offering them career-enriching learning and development opportunities , and planning ahead to retain needed skills and knowledge within the department when individuals retire or move to other opportunities . 
for many scientific disciplines , environment canada faces significant competition from other organizations in recruiting and retaining scientific talent . the same difficulty is experienced in other federal science-based departments and agencies . 
the federal s&t community has responded to this concern through several interdepartmental initiatives led by the science adms advisory committee on human resources (saac).8 
within its s&t workforce , environment canada must also encourage individuals to develop the skills needed to move into management positions . 
the progress reports , comprehensive reviews and other performance measures for the science plan will be based on the three principles of federal s&t : alignment , linkages and excellence .

message from dr. brian gray , assistant deputy minister , science and technology branch 
scientists equipped a dc-3 aircraft with specialized remote-sensing equipment that included a scanning laser environmental airborne fluorosensor ( sleaf ) . this active real-time sensor can operate during full daylight or in total darkness to detect and classify oil . 
sleaf technology can also discriminate between oiled and un-oiled weeds , and detect oil in a variety of marine and shoreline environments including on water , snow , ice and beaches . 
they also tested their laser ultrasonic remote sensing of oil thickness ( lursot ) sensor in the dc-3 aircraft . 
developed in collaboration with the industrial materials institute of the national research council , imperial oil and the united states minerals management service , the lursot sensor accurately measures oil-slick-on-water thickness . in april 2005 , environment canada scientists were successful in the world 's first airborne absolute measurement of oil slick thickness in a test tank set up on the grounds of the macdonald-cartier international airport in ottawa . 
any vessel of more than 5,000 tonnes found guilty would face a minimum fine of $ 100,000 for a summary conviction and $ 500,000 for an indictable offence .

4.1.1 sds outcome:integrated strategic policy with respect to sustainable development is developed and influences federal sustainable development approaches 
sds commitment : in its role to provide leadership , coordination and guidance on sdss , environment canada will be a source of sustainable development policy advice and will work interdepartmentally to improve the management and accountability of departmental sdss 
objectives : define the overall aim arising under each goal for the intermediate term ( 5-8 years ) 
sds commitment:increase access of educators and interested canadians to curriculum-linked learning material on sustainable development themes and topics ( e.g. energy sustainability ) through strategic partnerships with expert organizations responsible for content development and dissemination 
4.2.1 sds outcome:partnerships with other levels of governments are managed effectively 
comments covered a wide range of issues , including the importance of education , the federal role , linkages between the environment and the economy , and the format and organization of the discussion paper . 
most students agreed with the concept of sustainable development put forth ; their main concern was the lack of specifics with regard to how proposed targets were to be met . 
students also expressed the view that the discussion paper did not explain how members of the general public could be involved in implementing sustainable development principles . 
many also suggested that the strategy should identify barriers to implementing sustainable development 
the department of indian affairs and northern development invited other federal government departments to join it in a coordinated consultation on sustainable development strategies involving aboriginal and territorial governments and other stakeholders in the north . 
the paper contained a core section detailing many issues facing the north , as well as separate chapters that described some of the key sustainable development issues and activities each department wished to address . 
there were concerns that many decisions on northern science were based on a short-sighted , deficit-fighting perspective that would result in negative long-term impacts and a significant loss of capacity . 
specific issues raised included : the need for regulatory reform to give industry a clear picture of requirements in relation to sustainable development ; sustainable energy sources ; the importance of land claims resolution ; full-cost accounting of development ; contaminants in the north ; and the need for more ecosystem studies . 
from business and non-governmental sectors : although there was relatively little response to the draft strategy from non-governmental sectors , comments received were positive and supportive . 
interest was expressed in participating in the development of sustainable development indicators , and in conducting research on the concept of measurable parameters in the context of eco-efficiency . 
in most cases , amendments to increase the quantity , up to double the orginal amount , are accepted provided other factors in granting your orginal permit have not significantly changed .

[ return to annex 2 ] 
utilitarian view 
the first view is the utilitarian approach which promotes industry , unlimited consumerism and a belief in an infinitely expansionist future . 
what sustainability demands is a change in the way we behave - a change in our attitude toward the world . 
and that is as true of institutions as individuals . 
through the lens of environment , we can see the challenges very clearly . 
why is it that we can detect environmental contaminants at the level of parts per billion , but we are unable to unify the many fragmented pieces of policy and law in different jurisdictions ? 
why is it that we can reduce toxic emissions , in certain cases by 99 % , but we cannot agree on the role that economics plays in setting standards ? 
complex systems theory and its application to ecosystem approaches can be a valuable framework for policy and management because it prompts a paradigmatic shift towards a more holistic and multidisciplinary view of environmental systems and the interrelated effects they have on other natural and societal systems . 
complex systems thinking also brings forth new challenges , as both scientists and policy makers will have to meet on the same level to apply the above principles to create adaptive ecosystem management policies for to a range of present and future concerns . 
on friday , september 28 , 2001 , the environment canada policy research seminar series hosted professor james kay for his presentation entitled " ecosystems as complex systems : using this approach in policy " . 
all of these concepts involve a deviation from linear thinking and allow in-depth analysis to be undertaken of natural systems . 
long-term growth has been largely driven by technological developments that have emerged in response to societal needs .

in spring 2000 , canada 's transportation minister announced funding to revitalize canada 's rail service . 
the federal auto$mart program provides canadian motorists with helpful tips on buying , driving , and maintaining their vehicles to reduce fuel consumption . linkages transportation is mostly dependent on fossil fuel use , which is linked to air quality , acid rain , and climate change . 
despite government initiatives in place to increase and encourage energy efficiency , energy efficiency in the passenger transportation sector decreased 1.1 % between 1990 and 2002 , mainly due to canadians ' growing preference for minivans and sport utility vehicles . 
since industrialization , human activities such as burning fossil fuels have increased the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere . 
it is widely believed that increased emissions have enhanced the greenhouse effect , causing the atmosphere to warm and the climate to change . 
canadian emissions of six key greenhouse gases have grown 20 % since 1990 . 
the public education and outreach component of the climate change action fund ( ccaf ) builds awareness and understanding and provides canadians with the information necessary to take responsible action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . 
other ccaf programs are directed at the residential , commercial , industrial and transportation sectors and include funding for science as well as early actions to reduce emissions and increase understanding of impacts and adaptation in the public and private sectors . 
climate change is linked to stratospheric ozone depletion , primarily because the most important ozone-depleting substances ( chlorofluorocarbons , hydrochlorofluorocarbons ) are also powerful greenhouse gases and because ozone itself is a greenhouse gas . 
actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will also contribute to improved air quality , since the burning of fossil fuels creates both greenhouse gases and gases that cause air pollution .

the bulletin is part of a series of bulletins on the subject of sustaining canadaâ€™s forests . this bulletin deals with the importance of the forest resource in canada . the second bulletin which was published in 1997 , focused on the conservation of biological diversity in forested ecosystems .

the largest single factor , however , is the release of halocarbons , namely chlorofluorocarbons ( cfcs ) , bromofluorocarbons ( halons ) , methyl chloroform , carbon tetrachloride , methyl bromide , and hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( hcfcs ) . these odss have been used in air conditioning and refrigeration equipment , foams , aerosols , and fire extinguishers , and as solvents and pesticides . 
what is being done about the problem ? 
so far , over 165 countries have ratified the montreal protocol , which controls odss . 
the northwest territories has published guidelines for the same purpose . 
codes of practice have been prepared by environment canada to promote the reduction and eventual elimination of emissions of odss by industry and consumers . 
in terms of vehicle-kilometres , these other vehicle types represent approximately 28 % of urban transit . 
transit data do not include estimates of transit usage in passenger-kilometres . 
passenger-kilometres were estimated by multiplying transit vehicle-kilometres from the canadian urban transit association ( cuta ) data by an average vehicle occupancy of 14 persons per vehicle . 
this latter figure was derived from a random sample of 12 american urban transit systems , since their corresponding statistical compendium ( american public transit association , transit operating and financial statistics ) does include estimates of passenger-miles . 
the sample included non-bus modes of transit , since the average vehicle occupancy estimate is meant to cover all transit systems . 
a key feature of integrated forest management is that it addresses the sustainability of forests and wood supply and of the natural resources of water and soils , while accounting for wildlife , tourism , and aesthetic values . 
the need for better information and data to support sustainable development is increasingly recognized . 
generally agreed upon techniques for measuring biodiversity and monitoring environmental change have yet to emerge , but recent progress in this area has been made (  box 5.12 ) . 
as table 5.4 shows , 7.4 % of the total ecozone now enjoys some level of protection , up from 3.0 % in 1960 . 
another promising data-gathering initiative adopted by these jurisdictions , plus ontario , is the move towards a more ecosystem-based approach to forest inventories . 
in canada , atmospheric deposition of nitrogen in the form of ammonium and nitrate has steadily increased since the 1900s and , in the 1990s , was estimated to supply , on average , 2.5 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare per year to forests ( chambers et al. 2001 ) . 
this value is five times the pre-industrial value of 0.5 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare per year . 
in some cases , municipalities and industry may be faced with higher maintenance costs to clear clogged intake pipes , and communities may have to pay for additional filtration of drinking water to reduce taste and odour problems ( anderson and quartermaine 1998 ) . 
regional overview of enrichment in canada 
the large rivers that rise in the mountains , like the north and south saskatchewan and the bow , generally have much better water quality upstream of cities such as edmonton , calgary , and saskatoon , but the water quality becomes poorer downstream of these and other urban areas and in areas of intensive agriculture , as in the case of alberta 's oldman river ( government of canada 1996 ) . 
leaf uptake of ammonia is also possible . 
the toxic effects of high ambient concentrations of ammonia are most often seen in older leaves or needles and include discoloration and spotting , followed by blackening and drying up of the entire leaf . 
on broad-leaved woody plants exposed to high concentrations of ammonia , injury symptoms usually begin as large , dark-green , water-soaked areas that darken after several hours to brownish-grey or black lesions that are widely scattered over the leaf surface ( national research council 1979 ) . 
conifer needles exposed to ammonia darken to shades of grey-brown , purple , or black ( dueck et al. 1990 ) . 
the frequent use of nitrogen fertilizers in recent years has resulted in an increased incidence of nitrate poisoning ( kvasnicka and krysl 1996 ) . 
nitrite is absorbed into the blood and converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin , thus decreasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood ( yaremcio 1991 ) . 
cattle and sheep are more susceptible to poisoning , because microorganisms in their rumen ( their first stomach ) favour this conversion to nitrite ( osweiler et al. 1985 ) . 
horses and pigs are less susceptible , because they convert nitrate to nitrite in the intestine , where there is less opportunity for nitrites to be absorbed by the blood ( yaremcio 1991 ) . 
nitrate or nitrite ingested in drinking water can also cause problems for livestock . 
signs of acute nitrate poisoning in livestock include rapid pulse ( greater than 150 per minute ) and respiration , muscle tremors , vomiting , weakness , blindness , excess saliva and tear production , laboured , noisy , or violent breathing , dark " chocolate-coloured " blood , staggered gait , low body temperature , disorientation , and an inability to get up ( e.g. , yaremcio 1991 ; el-bahri et al. 1997 ; stoltenow and lardy 1998 ) . 
average precipitation in the abbotsford area is about 1 500 millimetres per year , and approximately 70 % of the total precipitation occurs during the october to march period , when nitrogen removal by crops is low . 
a study carried out in the mid-1990s ( wassenaar 1995 ) estimated that nitrateâ€“nitrogen concentrations exceeded 10 milligrams per litre in as much as 80 % of the study area in the aquifer . 
as health canada recommends a maximum concentration of 10 milligrams of nitrateâ€“nitrogen per litre in drinking water , this situation is of considerable concern . 
the study concluded that nitrate in the aquifer originated primarily from poultry manure , which is frequently applied to raspberry fields as a fertilizer . 
chemical fertilizers did not appear to be a significant contributor , nor did septic systems , which , according to estimates , accounted for less than 10 % of the nitrate in the aquifer . 
of this production , 58 % took place in marine environments and 42 % in freshwater environments ( see chambers et al. 2001 , table 3.14 ) . 
the majority of operations were located in either british columbia or new brunswick . 
aquaculture operations range from small private ponds to large cage cultures that produce thousands of tonnes of fish per year . 
nutrient releases from fish production result from excretion of dissolved or solid waste and from unconsumed feed . 
the quantity and quality of the feed largely determine the extent of nutrient loss to the environment , because they affect both feed wastage and excretion losses ( persson 1991 ; cho and bureau 1997 ) .

creating and using indicators 
indicator analysis 
sustainability indicators can show what progress is being made towards sustainability ; however , some analysis is required to illustrate this progress . 
as one of the largest nations on the globe , canada has a diversity of landscapes and seascapes that is seemingly endless -- temperate forests and arctic barrens , extensive river systems and coastlines , vast plains and imposing mountain ranges , farmscapes and wilderness , wetlands and deserts , great lakes and prairie potholes , ranging from relatively untouched to highly stressed systems . 
the variety can be overwhelming . 
naturalists , scientists , and many others have contributed to describing these natural zones . a wealth of maps and reports emerged . 
for the purposes of environmental management and sustainable resource use , however , this piece-by-piece approach has led to an incomplete and often misleading view . 
the terrestrial ecozones largely cover a broad range of forested , taiga and arctic ecosystem types .

the automobile 's impact has been all the greater because of its success . 
more than 12 million cars now traverse canada 's roads â€ ” one for nearly every two canadians , one of the highest ratios of car ownership in the world . 
on the one hand , there is the need to eliminate or reduce the environmental stresses associated with it . 
the car and the economy 
in canada , the demand for automobiles and associated products and services has stimulated activity in virtually every sector of the economy , contributing to a standard of living that is one of the highest in the world . 
new emission standards 
automobile manufacturers have voluntarily agreed to introduce , in canada , vehicles that meet the stringent exhaust emission standards being progressively introduced in the united states beginning in 1994 . 
these vehicles will emit 60 % less nox and 29 % less vocs than are currently allowed . 
the government is developing comprehensive emission control regulations to be effective in the 1996 time frame . 
alternative fuels 
currently available alternatives to gasoline include propane , natural gas , methanol , ethanol , and oxygenated gasolines ( varying mixtures of gasoline and alcohol ) such as m85 , which is 85 % methanol and 15 % gasoline .

table 2 : 
the beneficial uses of water and purpose of guidelines 
it communicates the general state of water quality for 25 water bodies , representative of the range of conditions expected to be found in the atlantic region , and highlights the information and knowledge gaps that , when filled , will improve the accuracy and relevance of the index in future applications . 
the report also features the context for monitoring and managing water quality in each of the atlantic provinces , and some of the actions being taken to conserve and improve the quality of surface water resources as habitats for aquatic life , drinking water sources , recreational areas , and agricultural uses . 
managing aquatic ecosystems is a responsibility shouldered by a wide range of individuals and organizations , including individual citizens , local interest groups , industry , academia , and all levels of government . 
due to space limitations , however , only some of these actions are highlighted in this report . 
in this way , a more complete picture of water quality is communicated . 
in these situations , development of site-specific objectives is usually warranted because national guidelines ( i.e. ccme ) tend to be conservative to ensure protection of aquatic life . 
site-specific objectives are used in the same way as numeric guidelines , but are derived for individual watersheds or ecosystem types , which take into account natural background conditions and management targets ( i.e. , remediate to a desired state or prevent current conditions from deteriorating ) . 
in this regard , the index becomes a more effective tool for communicating whether water quality has achieved a desired state or departs from natural conditions , rather than a tool to indicate the general state of water quality . 
as highlighted in each provincial section of this report , some work remains to fill information and knowledge gaps needed to improve application of the index . 
base metal mining has been an important economic activity within the nepisiguit river watershed . 
the now closed bathurst mine is located approximately 12 kilometres upstream from the sample station . 
the mine began production in the mid-1960s , and in the early years sporadic release of acid mine drainage resulted in increased concentrations of copper and zinc in the river . 
presently , effluent is piped northward to the still active brunswick mine for treatment , before release to little river , which is not located within the nepisiguit river watershed . 
the caribou mine is located in the headwaters of forty mile brook ; a tributary of the nepisiguit river located approximately fifty kilometres upstream of the sampling station . 
protection of aquatic life â€ ” good ( 83 ) 
broad cove brook waters are rated as good for the protection of aquatic life because aluminum and ph often fail to meet the recommended guidelines , while iron occasionally exceeds it . 
these exceedances are thought to be largely due to natural influences . 
source of drinking water â€ ” good ( 82 ) 
the waters of broad cove brook are rated as a good source of drinking water , requiring some treatment , in addition to disinfection ( always required ) , to be suitable for human consumption . 
it is also renowned for some of its many rivers which , for the most part , tend to be fairly short and some , highly coloured . these include : the annapolis river , which flows through a wide trough that parallels nova scotia 's northern shoreline on the bay of fundy ; the gaspereau river , the estuary of which is on an arm of the bay of fundy , where the tide fluctuates nearly 12 metres twice a day ; the avon river , which flows to the minas basin ; the shubenacadie river , in central nova scotia , which issues from grand lake north of halifax and flows north to cobequid bay and south to bedford basin ; the margaree river in cape breton , which flows to the gulf of st. lawrence at margaree harbour ; and the tusket river which flows north to south in the southwestern portion of nova scotia . 
this situation , in conjunction with the lack of a formal federalâ€“provincial water quality agreement , has resulted in a series of regional monitoring initiatives , based on partnerships with various stakeholder groups ( e.g. , the pockwockâ€“bowater watershed project ) . 
additionally , human health-related programs , such as the municipal drinking water monitoring program , and the groundwater observation well network are instituted broadly throughout the province . 
as well , environment canada operates a limited river water quality sampling network through an adjunct to the federal/provincial hydrometric program . 
under the nova scotia environment act , the department of environment and labour manages all surface water and groundwater ; in some cases , however , there is joint responsibility with other provincial and federal departments ( e.g. , nova scotia department of fisheries and agriculture , fisheries and oceans canada , and environment canada ) . 
piskahegan river 
there are no concerns for tusket river waters being suitable for livestock watering . 
tusket river waters are rated as excellent and likely suitable for crop irrigation , but fecal coliform data needs to be collected to confirm this . 
the water quality of the tusket river will continue to be monitored . reductions in acidifying emissions will continue to be pursued . 
no further action is required â€ ” index ratings are currently largely a reflection of natural background conditions and not a result of human activities . 
prince edward island has few natural freshwater lakes or ponds . however , there are hundreds of small human-made impoundments . 
furthermore , rivers and ponds provide habitat for a great diversity of plants , fish , shellfish , aquatic mammals , and waterfowl . 
prince edward island 's surface waters face some significant problems . 
agricultural land use practices can overload streams and estuaries with silt , bacterial contamination , nutrients , and pesticides . 
road construction , urban and commercial development , and forestry operations also contribute to the sediment and nutrient loading in watercourses . 
phosphorus and nitrate enrichment can result in blooms of sea lettuce , causing harmful periods of anoxia when the lettuce dies and starts decomposing .

in addition , municipal bylaws place concentration limits on several heavy metals ( including silver ) that can enter the wastewater stream . 
since fixer solutions are acidic and developer solutions are basic , release of these solutions to the sewer are also subject to municipal bylaws for ph. therefore , to protect the environment , the dental community should : 
ensure that silver containing wastes and untreated spent x-ray developer and fixer solutions are not released to common waste streams ( sewage system , biomedical waste or regular garbage ) .

pollution prevention is the " use of processes , practices , materials , products , substances or energy that avoid or minimize the creation of pollutants and waste , and reduce the overall risk to the environment or human health " ( canadian environmental protection act , 1999 ) . 
assessing the costs and benefits of existing environmental protection practices and of pollution prevention options is important to ensuring that pollution prevention initiatives result in the most cost-effective outcomes possible . 
price lists 
these objectives for improvement should be considered at the product concept and design stages . 
product concept and design parameters to consider may include the function , performance , quality , environmental impacts , and legal requirements of the product . 
design strategies may involve matching the design of the product to its function , selecting low impact materials , reducing materials used , optimizing product lifetime , and minimizing end-of-life impacts . 
generic material flow diagram for primary processing stage 
describe each action that you plan to implement or have already implemented in the pollution prevention plan (  for example , " implemented ' first-in-first-out ' stock management , " " replaced solvent-based cleaners with aqueous solutions , " " located solvent storage tanks away from sources of heat and added chillers , " " installed overflow alarms and relief valves " ) . 
schedule 1 : declaration that a pollution prevention plan has been prepared and is being implemented ( subsection 58(1) of cepa 1999 ) ( declaration of preparation ) ; 
equipment or process modifications - introducing new technologies or approaches to existing operating systems , processes and practices to improve production efficiencies and reduce pollution generated and materials , energy or water wasted ( for example , changing to mechanical stripping/cleaning devices from solvents ; using more efficient spray-paint systems ; instituting recirculation within a process ) . 
spill and leak prevention - using measures to prevent accidental and chronic releases such as leaks of a substance ( for example , installing splash guards and drip trays around equipment , such as solvent sinks , hot tanks and jet-spray washers , to collect and return drainage and contain leaks and spills ) . 
safe disposal - final disposal in such a way as to cause the least amount of harm to the environment ( for example , landfill of biodegradable materials , containment of wastes containing the substance ) . 
at falconbridge 's brunswick lead smelter , the majority of the so2 is generated from the sinter machine in the smelting process . 
improved capture systems can enhance the containment of batch converter gases , reducing air infiltration , minimizing dilution of these weak so2 streams , and lowering their flow rate . 
this makes these streams more suitable as feeds for acid plants or other treatment systems ( i.e. , alkali scrubbing , liquid so2 plants ) . 
water-cooled hoods capture the process off-gases coming from the openings of the converters . 
these openings also present sources of emissions . fugitive sources of so2 are usually a minor portion of total facility emissions . 
all of the 6 base metal facilities analyzed in this study operate electrostatic precipitators ( esps ) to address process emissions . 
mercury contained in the concentrate feed may be volatilized in the high temperature roasters , flash furnaces , electric furnaces , and converters , and carried in the off-gases . 
it may be combined with particulate matter ( pm ) , which is collected by pm control devices or is emitted . 
a portion of the potential mercury emissions is controlled through the use of esps and baghouses that address pm emissions . 
however , at high temperatures some metals like mercury may be gaseous and pass through esps and other pm control systems .

the scope for this area , in terms of scientific and technological needs , management , and communication strategies , is constantly under review . 
outreach strategies 
specific outreach strategies for the past year were focused on supporting severe weather awareness activities and emergency preparedness exercises in regions of canada often subject to extreme weather . 
municipal and federal governments and private and volunteer organizations were represented . an msc forecaster provided weather briefings as the simulated storm evolved . the forecaster also acted as the spokesperson on weather conditions during simulated media scrums . 
this exercise promoted the need for cooperative emergency preparedness and management , assisted participants in identifying deficiencies in current emergency plans and enhanced their understanding of the interdependencies among organizations in dealing effectively with emergencies . 
survey on high impact weather events : as mentioned previously , the msc commissioned two surveys following severe weather events ( a thunderstorm in saskatoon in the summer of 2002 and a combination of a freezing rain and snowstorm in the fraser valley in the winter of 2002-2003 ) to determine whether canadians see or hear weather warnings , to determine the actions they took upon hearing the warnings , and the impacts , if any , of the events . 
these surveys help the msc to understand public perceptions and behaviour with respect to severe weather and warning messages and measure the effectiveness of such warnings in reducing negative impacts .

push factors ( identified internally within the msc ) created a sense of urgency for change , and pull factors ( external to the msc ) reflected changes taking place in domestic and global environments . 
together these factors created the articulation of a new or desired state — an msc vision for the future . 
while the vision is still under development , the core theme is service improvement . specific areas of service improvement include : 
placing a priority on high-impact weather , precipitation forecast , improving lead times , and providing new products and services ; 
developing of new services such as road weather information systems ; 
the council has initiated the lca-nordic project to develop a code of practice for life-cycle analysis . 
the project , now in its second phase , will produce a manual containing a code of practice and guidelines for screening product life-cycle assessments for industry and other practitioners . 
the manual will also cover topics such as system boundary setting , cut-off criteria , allocations , data quality and impact assessment methods . 
sweden 's environmental policy , established in its ecocycle bill , requires all decisions to be directed toward efficient management and to promote an"ecocycle " society with closed-circuit material flows . 
ordinances passed in august and september 1994 require producers to take responsibility after use for packaging , newspapers , and tires . 
phase one has applied basic principles of life-cycle impact assessment - classification , characterization , evaluation - to identify key environmental metrics ( indicators ) associated with the production phase of the pulp and paper life cycle . 
considering current environmental regulatory , public and market issues and trends in the industry , the project team evaluated 37 potential impact stressors ( metrics ) . 
it then used a rigorous six-step process to classify known potential impact stressors such as sulphur oxide compounds first into broad categories such as air emissions and then into sub-categories such as acid rain . 
primary , secondary , tertiary and quaternary impact chains were identified for each stressor , then potential metrics associated with the stressor were classified and evaluated for the guidance document . 
for more information contact the canadian standards association . 
this voluntary project was launched to provide data to small and medium sized companies to encourage them to consider the broader upstream and downstream implications of their products . 
the data can be used by the raw material producers to benchmark environmental progress or by downstream companies to support environmental improvements in their products . 
when completed , the database will provide industry-averaged data on energy and raw material inputs , and environmental releases of the raw material acquisition and manufacturing stages of the material life-cycle . 
raw material industries participating in phase i include : aluminum , glass , paper , plastics , steel and wood 
the proposed phase ii of the database recognizes that in order to provide comprehensive environmental information to product manufacturers and designers , other raw materials and resources need to be considered . 
ecocycle will continue to focus on raising awareness and sharing information on policy and technical issues related to environmental life cycle management ( lcm ) within canada and abroad , and advancing tools and approaches to improving the environmental performance of product systems . 
ipp refers to a public policy that explicitly aims to modify and improve the environmental performance of product systems . 
objectives of the meeting 
convene experts to examine product - and supply chain-focused policies and tools such as ipp , eco-efficiency and epr ; 
this is particularly true in the context of international trade and the growing application of these tools by canada ’s trading partners . 
as a result , education must play its role and work for a sustainable future . 
a few days before the thessaloniki international conference , the representatives of ngos from approximetaly twenty countries met in response to an invitation from the conference organizers , as part of the preparatory activities . 
a declaration produced by this meeting was presented at the international conference . 
this document sets out the core of the proposals contained in the thessaloniki declaration . 
recognition is forthcoming for ee and its evolution , the emphasis is placed on the adoption of environmental education and awareness and sustainable development as one of the pillars of viability . 
everywhere , however , there appears the expression ee sd ( environmental education for sustainable development ) , retaining the key role of ee , which appears to have vanished from the thessaloniki declaration .

voluntary risk management instruments 
information based risk management instruments 
the pre-screening was performed by two risk managers from the nopp and one economist from reab . 
because this is a preliminary assessment , scores were not assigned to the risk management instruments . instead , they were assessed qualitatively as to their : 
reporting requirement for manufacturers of products containing 2-be would not ensure a reduction in exposure of humans to 2-be . however , if used in combination with other instruments they can improve the information available for decision making and for monitoring and compliance efforts . 
a tc is the level of exposure to which it is believed a person may be exposed daily over a lifetime without deleterious effect . 
fugacity modeling and limited sampling results indicate that the concentrations of 2-be in ambient air are less than the tc. however , based on estimation of exposure to 2-be from a limited number of consumers products tested by health canada , concentrations of 2-be in indoor air during the use of products containing the substance could potentially exceed the tc. 
2-be is considered a " track 2 " substance as defined in the " toxic substances management policy " , hence life cycle management is therefore the approached taken to prevent or minimize its releases into the environment . 
exposure sources 
the following table outlines the possible routes of emissions of 2-be to the atmosphere ( ambient air ) and human exposure to 2-be ( indoor air or direct contact ) . 
american conference of governmental industrial hygienists ( acgih ) : the current threshold level value ( tlv ) for 2-be specified by this organization is an 8 hour twa of 20 ppm . 
the acgih level is referenced in many canadian provincial ohs acts and regulations . 
federal insecticide , fungicide and rodenticide act ( fifra ) : under the fifra , information on formulants including 2-be is collected when pesticide products are registered ( or re-registered ) . 
in the epa " inert ingredients in pesticide products ; policy statement , 1987 " 2-be is included on list 2 - potentially toxic inert/high priority for testing . 
substances included on this list are the focus of information gathering and monitoring by the epa . 
these two documents set out best management practices ( bmps ) for wood preservation facilities . 
the following questions refer to the bmps as established in these documents . 
have you implemented the bmps with regards to chemical receiving and unloading areas ? ? 
if no , what aspects remain outstanding ? 
have you implemented the bmps with regards to chemical storage areas ? ? 
the otc consumer products rule based on the consumer products rule of the california air resources board ( carb ) , addresses a broader list of products and tightens the voc content limits for some of the product categories in the national rule . 
table 4 provides a list of the product categories and voc content limits for both the national rule and the otc model rule .

volatile organic compounds are present in certain pesticide products as formulants , the non-active component of the formulation , and are therefore subject to pmra ’s formulants program . 
the formulants program outlines how formulants are regulated in canadian pesticide products and ensures that information on formulations is accurate and meets current standards . 
the program allows the pmra to manage formulants which are identified as being of concern with respect to human health or the environment . 
the departments recognize that regulation of voc under both cepa and the pcpa would incur an additional regulatory burden for the pesticide industry . 
to streamline regulatory processes , pmra will develop a strategy to manage voc in certain pesticide products under the pcpa , aligned with the requirements of the usepa rule . the requirements of other jurisdictions will be considered in the development of the strategy . 
with respect to the challenge posed to canadian companies in meeting the standards of the us federal regulation , there was a mixed message from industry representatives . 
some claimed a high degree of compliance with these standards , while others indicated that they would be challenged to meet these values . 
in pursuing national product content standards for voc-containing products , stakeholders were supportive of a strategy based on alignment with the us . 
the departments have also concluded that it is reasonable to consider the more aggressive voc content standards adopted , or in the process of being adopted , by otc states and california . 
alignment is intended to facilitate consistency in product requirements in a north american market and to allow canada to benefit from the us experience in implementing emission reduction strategies . 
for water-based coatings , there were no technical issues identified with formulating a mastic texture coating to meet the proposed limit . 
there is a potential vulnerability with continuous exposure to water and also an issue with cold weather application . 
solvent-based coatings may be formulated to comply with the proposed limit , however , they may have an increased viscosity to non-complying formulations . 
it is not possible to use exempt solvents ( mainly acetone ) since there is an asphalt component of the resin which is not soluble in these solvents. /ref1/ 
mpi has several categories of mastic texture coatings . 
number of products : 3 
products complying with proposed limit : 3 ( 100 % 
wb products : 100 % 
sb products : 0 % 
there is one mpi category for multi-coloured coatings . 
all coatings in this category have voc contents below 250 g/l. /ref3/ 
rust preventative coatingsvoc content limits ( grams/litre ) 
this category was created to describe coatings which are used for preventing corrosion of ferrous metal surfaces in non-industrial situations .

slags can be used in the manufacture of ceramics and they could be used for production of insulating wool . 
the main barriers to reuse are the quantities of impurities in the material being re-used . 
for instance , slags used for road construction must pass leachate tests prior to use . 
6.5.1 recycle 
typically , the following practices are used for furnace linings : 
these can be recycled to the production process or sent for metals recovery to other base metals facilities ( e.g. , for the production of precious metals , lead , copper , and cadmium ) . 
sludges from hydrometallurgical processes are not typically recycled . 
anode slimes produced in electrolytic cells in copper production tank houses are processed for recovery of the precious metals and other valuable metals . 
this recovery may occur on the site where the slimes were generated or at another metals facility .

cost implications 
since changes are mainly to monitoring and reporting requirements , the proposed amendment do not impose a need for additional pollution prevention and control measures . 
final amending regulations will be published in the canada gazette , part ii , and will come into force upon its registration . 
entities affected by proposed amendments 
the fisheries act prohibits the deposit of deleterious substances except those made under the authority of regulations . 
the changes that are being proposed also affect this mill . 
proposed changes are described in the following sections 
acronyms under the heading , indicate which entities affected by proposals 
entities affected : ddm , pam , ostf 
daphnia magna tests are normally conducted weekly . 
in the 1992 regulations , when a daphnia magna test is failed , mills have to conduct daphnia magna testing three times a week as well as an immediate trout test . 
a proposal is made to remove the need for thrice weekly daphnia testing , since results indicate that daphnia generally is less sensitive than trout , and is used as a trigger for conducting a rainbow trout test . 
schedule ii 
reference method for determining the acute lethality of effluent to daphnia magna eps 1/rm/14 , july 1990 , as amended 1996 ; 
aquatic environmental effects monitoring requirements document eps 1/rm/18 ( this would refer to the latest revision of the eem requirement document ) . 
the latter proposed amendment is supported by the fact that test results indicate that the daphnia magna is generally less sensitive than the rainbow trout , and is mainly used as a trigger for conducting a rainbow trout test . 
information concerning effluent outfalls 
as mentioned above , the department is proposing , based on policy and legal considerations , to regroup all of its monitoring , reporting and record keeping requirements related to the deposit of effluent , under the heading conditions governing the deposits in order to clarify and streamline the regulatory requirements . 
this also applies to the submission of effluent outfall information . 
4.4 proposed amendments that would affect indirect discharging mills 
under the current pper , mills that deposit their effluents into an ostf for treatment are permitted to deposit into that facility any amount of bod , tss and concentration of acutely lethal effluent .

june 2000 consultation document - pulp and paper effluent regulations - section 6 
environment canada worked with a group of stakeholders to come up with an effective risk management instrument to reduce the harm caused by road salts to the environment . 
a broad range of management actions was studied , including improved application technologies and better storage and handling techniques . 
on september 20 , 2003 , the resulting proposed code of practice for the environmental management of road salts was published for a 60-day consultation period . 
the final code of practice was published on april 3rd , 2004 . 
the code of practice recommends to those who use road salts to develop salt management plans that will improve their storage and application of road salts , and their disposal of snow that contains road salts , thereby protecting the environment while maintaining road safety . 
q - please clarify why reporting is proposed along with a requirement to have data available for ec to review . a - ec may need to gather more data for the 5-year review of progress and therefore would like to have the data available . 
ec may need more detail on subjects that have been summarized in the regular reports . 
q - keeping all of the data for 5 years may be a concern . 
it is important to refine what is needed so that it doesn't require too much record keeping . 
a - ec will prepare an information document to clarify the points of the code . 
this concluded their work and the steering committee has been disbanded . 
barry thanked the 14 sponsors of the project and bob hodgins of ecoplans limited , the consultant on the project , for their hard work . 
the 9 syntheses of best practices were prepared in a very short time to coincide with the release of the draft code of practice on monday . 
the syntheses of best practices were approved by tac 's chief engineers ' council and are being distributed free of charge . 
they are also available on tac 's website . 
there may be resistance if too much is expected . 
the requirements should be made straightforward for smaller municipalities .

recovery program summary 
part 3describes the steps necessary for developing and implementing a halocarbon recovery program for domestic appliances . 
part 4 contains a list of various resource persons that can be contacted during the implementation of the program , including government contacts and individuals responsible for existing municipal programs . 
this guide also contains a series of appendices listing various private sector resources of use . 
this guide is an update of the document entitled designing a program to recover cfcs from domestic appliances 
1 published by environment canada in 1996 . 
imagine the world of 4 billion years ago . 
the planet was filled with volcanoes and atmosphere that consisted mainly of carbon dioxide and methane . 
the various organizations around the world that compile data from ozone monitoring sites publish updates on a regular basis . 
environment canada provides weekly and monthly reports for canadian stations at www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/images/ozone . 
the experimental studies division of environment canada ( http://exp-studies.tor.ec.gc.ca ) also runs , for the world meteorological organization and the world community , the world ozone and ultraviolet radiation data center . 
a good site on trends on the antarctic ozone hole is http://www.nilu.no/projects/nadir/o3hole/y2001.htm . 
what are other ozone-depleting substances ? 
environment canada scientists had succeeded in developing a system to bring information on the strength of the sun ’s uv rays directly into canadian homes on a daily basis . 
when the uv index was invented by environment canada scientists that spring , canada became the first country in the world to issue daily nation-wide uv forecasts . 
consumer pressure led industry to agree to a voluntary reduction of cfcs in spray cans during the 1970s . 
hrai has proposed to spearhead an industry-led program for the disposal of cfcs from the commercial refrigeration and air conditioning and chiller sectors , funded through a voluntary levy on replacement refrigerants ( hcfcs ) . 
however , several practical issues with this proposal remain to be resolved , and generally this industry-led approach may not be feasible for all of the various sectors ( e.g. , for halons it will be a particular challenge ) . 
major ods1 suppliers were identified as potential leaders for the necessary initiatives to manage ods surplus in canada , in keeping with the principles of product stewardship . 
industry can and should play a key role in the development of management strategies to phase-out , collect and dispose of surplus ods in canada . 
appropriate roles for both government and industry should include:education/communication on available alternative technologies and products ; 
developing cost impact analyses for management plans for ods phase-out ; 
appropriate roles for industry in particular should include:development of management plans for retrofitting , converting or replacement of existing systems using cfcs and halons ; 
(4) subsection 18(1) does not apply 
(a) before january 1 , 2002 to nasal sprays ; 
(b) before january 1 , 2002 to metered-dose inhalers whose active ingredient is salbutamol or beclomethasone ; 
(c) before january 1 , 2003 to metered-dose inhalers whose active ingredient is a corticosteroid ; and 
(d) before january 1 , 2005 to all other metered-dose inhalers , including those containing a mixture of active ingredients . 
the ninth meeting of the parties decided to allow for possible exemptions to these production/consumption phase-out dates in order to meet the marketplace demand for uses that are considered " critical " . 
the parties have established criteria and a procedure to assess nominations for " critical " use exemptions . 
pursuant to subparagraphs 68(a)(ix) and 68(a)(xiii) of the canadian environmental protection act , 1999 , the following notice describes the criteria , process and schedule that the department of the environment will use to determine the relevance of nominations received for an exemption for a " critical " use of methyl bromide , as agreed to under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer . 
if the nomination is accepted by the parties to the montreal protocol , the party in possession of the exemption authorises the applicant to acquire the methyl bromide according to the terms of the decision . 
2 for " critical " uses , significant market disruption would mean the loss of an industry sector or production sector ( e.g. one crop ) , not just the loss of one company or facility , unless a single company represents a large portion of the market . 
* the length of time required to obtain a ministerial decision can vary . 
the oewg meets and recommends whether or not the nomination should be approved . 
the oewg drafts the decision , if applicable .

at the department of justice 's headquarters , the waste diversion rate has been maintained at 80 % for 2001-2002 . 
national defence has reduced the amount of solid waste sent to landfill by 4 % from 2000-2001 levels . some of this reduction was through increased waste diversion . 
environment canada has launched and will continue to administer a web portal facilitating access to information , best practices , and tools related to greening government generally and to the sdgo initiative specifically . 
pwgsc is in charge of encouraging interdepartmental participation and building regional capacity for coordinated greening of federal operations . 
the traditional use of in-ground sumps for disposal was identified as a significant toxic and environmental risk . 
similarly , health canada supports the healthcare environet website and has worked in partnership with various medical organizations ( e.g. , canadian association of physicians for the environment and canadian coalition for green health care ) to develop materials on greening canadian hospitals .
