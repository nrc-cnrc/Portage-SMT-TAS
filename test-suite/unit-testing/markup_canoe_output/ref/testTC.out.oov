the action plan on the visitors <OOV>frontalier</OOV> of windsor provide between the other <OOV>réfection</OOV> of publicly funded , the implementation of technologies introduced to facilitate the visitors of trafficking and improve the access to the border . 
in september 2002 , the federal government and the ontario announced investment a total of $ 300 million as to improve the approach , side criminal , there <OOV>frontalier</OOV> <OOV>windsor-detroit</OOV> . 
the contribution of the federal government has just the funds for infrastructure border patrol . 
a committee joint management was when it was reviewing the allocation of money . 
as i said earlier , the governments of canada and ontario have announced 27,000 may , 2003 , the next the entire action plan on the visitors <OOV>frontalier</OOV> of windsor . 
the conditions of the money on infrastructure border patrol are such that only the infrastructure landmines are expenses . 
these private are in line to the kyoto agreement signed the 25 september 2002 on a investment of $ 300 million on the next five years to improve the infrastructure of the ways of approach of the job <OOV>frontalier</OOV> side criminal the border . 
i am pleased that the hon. member opposite raised this issue , given that the public has the feeling that transportation of <OOV>marchandises</OOV> way is completely out forbidden on the <OOV>pont</OOV> <OOV>ambassador</OOV> and that the <OOV>camionneurs</OOV> <OOV>enlèvent</OOV> the <OOV>indicateurs</OOV> of jeopardy on the <OOV>marchandises</OOV> way so avoid delay or <OOV>détours</OOV> . 
to turn back to the question the member has raised in june , the regulations to police the transportation of <OOV>marchandises</OOV> way require transportation banned concerns , that they are <OOV>transportées</OOV> by <OOV>traversier</OOV> or <OOV>camion</OOV> . 
indeed , the licensed of <OOV>pont</OOV> private required their own regulations and the blackout period is not full . 
we could provide some conditions such as the type and the amount of <OOV>marchandises</OOV> way and the speed permitted and hour of the day where those <OOV>marchandises</OOV> go across the <OOV>pont</OOV> <OOV>ambassador</OOV> . 
the bureaucrats customs sign the <OOV>marchandises</OOV> way to make ends meet the <OOV>pont</OOV> and to post of <OOV>traverse</OOV> . 
customs officers <OOV>vérifient</OOV> always if we carries of <OOV>marchandises</OOV> way and if documents and a of jeopardy such that <OOV>affiches</OOV> correspond to <OOV>marchandises</OOV> <OOV>transportées</OOV> . 
we said no problem had been outlined in that regard . 
the department of transport and the federal government ontario day-to-day concurrent jurisdiction system could regular and <OOV>éclairs</OOV> of <OOV>marchandises</OOV> way . we concluded that it is a rare that detract the a of jeopardy . 
that is not beyond the control of <OOV>hasard</OOV> , if i hope , but instead of effort made by the federal and provincial inspectors and cooperation of industry . 
mr. brian masse : 
mr. speaker , it is just incredible . 
we have seen many reports <OOV>médiatiques</OOV> as a <OOV>vidéo</OOV> of <OOV>chauffeurs</OOV> of <OOV>camion</OOV> admit failure <OOV>enlèvent</OOV> the fragmentation on their vehicles or they know people who do basis . 
it is practice prevalent . 
we bay that we <OOV>acceptons</OOV> that natural dangerous remain in the doors of recruiting offices of our cities during the hours in the vehicles that the forefront before schools , the companies and <OOV>domiciles</OOV> because they do not have access to a <OOV>traversier</OOV> . 
that is the irony here , because this service , the only in the country , is <OOV>traduirait</OOV> by the benefits <OOV>immédiats</OOV> , but the government discrimination against in the shift pay services officials customs . 
the government is also pay the services of <OOV>brise-glace</OOV> of the coast guard . 
i want to therefore ask the parliamentary secretary is really talked to his personnel . 
<OOV>accepterait</OOV> it come in my to talk to the people who <OOV>retirent</OOV> the fragmentation of their vehicles and put and the community in result ? 
mr. marcel proulx : 
mr. speaker , as i mentioned , the inspectors of federal governments and ontario at basis control , and i am told , contrary to what my colleague says , it is not basis . 
after our of inspectors , this is not the case and , on the contrary , it is the same rare that this happens .
