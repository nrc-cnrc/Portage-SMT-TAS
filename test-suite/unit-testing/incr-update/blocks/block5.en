	 British Columbia right now is reeling.  It is bruised and battered. I want to ask my colleague about the specific issue of the removal of regular forces and bases from the mainland of British Columbia.

	 I think it is unbelievable that this has been allowed to happen and that the base in Chilliwack, for example, was closed down.  Nevertheless, that has happened. I would suggest that at a minimum we should have additional militia units, or reserves, in British Columbia, if for no other reason than to react to natural disaster tragedies that occur from time to time, like the flooding and the forest fires.

	 Despite the fact that the forces from Edmonton did absolutely yeoman service in coming across the Rocky Mountains, getting into British Columbia, and helping to fight those forest fires this summer,  I still do believe that communities in British Columbia could be better served with at least additional militia units,   if not by having a base there with regular forces on the mainland of British Columbia. The City of Prince George in my riding is one of the cities that has been lobbying hard for that, but so far we have not seen the government move in that regard.

	 I would put that question to my colleague.  What are his thoughts about  it, especially given the present disaster situation in B.C.?
