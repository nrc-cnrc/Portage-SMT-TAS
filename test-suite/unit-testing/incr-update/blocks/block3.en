	 We are going to support this bill, as we should.  It is the right thing.  It  will modernize the pension act for our military people, which needs to be reformed. The reform is long overdue, but I have a great fear about this. I urge the Liberals to    show us that they care  enough about our servicemen and servicewomen   to sit in this House long enough to see this bill get royal assent.
         I do not think they will.  This is just  another charade, with them saying they have to get a bill down here or something. Really, it is meaningless, because we are not sure who is in power.  One person is living at 24 Sussex, but another one is holding the caucus meetings. One is in charge, but one is not. One has the power of the backbench and one does not.

	 Canadian people do not care about that.  They want to see us make changes in here, but the Liberals  have brought in this bill less than three weeks  before they plan to prorogue just to waste everybody's time.

	 If they actually care about the unwavering commitment given by the men and women  of our forces, then I challenge every government  member to pressure his or her own House leader to make sure we are here after November 7 working on this bill, making sure that it goes to the Senate,  and making sure that it gets royal assent. I ask them to show us they care about the men and women of our Canadian Forces.
