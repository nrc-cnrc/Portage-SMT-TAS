	Canadian Forces Superannuation Act
	 I question the government as to why it took  so long to bring forward this  bill.   I hope  the bill will  actually become law because it  is one I support, but we have all been informed that the House will likely rise, adjourn or prorogue on November 7, which  is less than three weeks from now.
That will be it until some time in the new year when the member for LaSalle--Émard gets the keys to 24 Sussex and tries to come in with a throne speech and do some grandstanding for an election.  It is not acceptable.  
	 This bill is just one example of  many important issues on which  we need to be in this place working. We need to be here looking after the interests of Canadians.  We have many critically important issues but this place has virtually come to a grinding halt.
Yes, we are here in body, but the problem is that  as we look at the government members they are so caught up.
The current Prime Minister who resides at 24 Sussex Drive has absolutely no power in the government caucus, and the member for LaSalle--Émard, a backbencher with no tangible power, holds all the real power of the caucus.
