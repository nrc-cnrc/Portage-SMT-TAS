	Mr. Speaker, perhaps I am not  quite as pessimistic as my colleague from Saanich--Gulf Islands in that we are debating third reading of Bill C-37 today. I hope that the bill  will be passed through the House of Commons in the next few days and that the Senate  will sit long enough to see it pass through the other place and indeed get royal assent.  I think that is extremely important.  That is why I certainly applaud the government for belatedly bringing forward this legislation. As I said in my remarks, it should have been done some five years ago, but as we on the opposition side often say, better late than never.

	 In this case, I will say that I do not care what the  reasoning is for it.  It is still the right thing to do, belatedly, so I certainly will be supporting these efforts.

	 I want to comment just briefly on the situation in my home province, the province of my colleague. British Columbia has had an absolutely devastating year. First there were the forest fires and now, as   could be noted during question period today, my colleague from West Vancouver--Sunshine Coast has raised  concerns about a couple of lives lost, and more feared lost, in the terrible flooding in the lower mainland of British Columbia.
