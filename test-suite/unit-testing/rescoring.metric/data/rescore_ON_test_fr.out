the action plan will provide regarding the frontalier of windsor notably with the truck réfection system , the implementation of technologies that would facilitate the will of assurances and the improvement to access to the border .
in september 2002 , the federal government and the ontario had announced investment a total of $ 300 million in as of the improvement for the approach , side , as the ops frontalier windsor-detroit .
the contribution from the federal funds for infrastructure border .
the committee was a joint management role to examine the individual funds .
as i said earlier , the governments of canada and in ontario , on may have announced put , 2003 , the next behind the action plan to the will frontalier of windsor .
the conditions of money on infrastructure such as the border is only infrastructure land are eligible .
those are the government could have signed the kyoto agreement 25 september 2002 with a investing $ 300 million in on the next five years to improve the infrastructure of means approach of the as frontalier ops side of the border .
i am pleased that the member opposite has raised this issue , given that the government has the prevalence of our that the transportation marchandises is fully should on pont ambassador and that the camionneurs enlèvent the indicateurs in jeopardy on the marchandises prevalence of supermarkets at the delay or not be détours .
to go to the issue that the member has raised in june , the taxation of the regulations to provide the transportation marchandises prevalence transportation and safer payments , they are transportées by traversier or by camion .
in the effect of their own private pont owners have regulations and the argument is not complete .
it is specific conditions such as the kind of and prevalence of marchandises as well for permitted and now of the day where those marchandises are tough the pont ambassador .
the officials of customs sign their marchandises prevalence to meet the two pont and to post of traverse .
the of customs officers vérifient if we still carries the prevalence of marchandises and if documents and a in jeopardy such as the affiches up to marchandises transportées .
we told me that no problem is was gardner in that regard .
the federal government and the department of transport in ontario their a new system , we could still regular and éclairs prevalence of marchandises . we have heard that it is a rare that we have said to in jeopardy .
that is not the after the hasard , if i hope say , but instead of inspectors made efforts by the federal and provincial et de la coopération for that industry .
mr. brian masse :
mr. speaker , it is just incredible .
we have seen many reports médiatiques so that a vidéo of chauffeurs camion that they are running enlèvent the fragmentation on their vehicles or that they are people who are the regularly .
is practice given .
we also street that we acceptons products that the dangerous remain in the patrol in our cities , while at the vehicles that are the forefront before the schools , businesses and the domiciles because they did not access to a traversier .
it is ironic because this service , the only in this country , traduirait by the benefits immédiats , but the government in the discrimination and pay the services officials of customs .
the government is also pay the services brise-glace of the american coast guard .
i want to ask the parliamentary secretary so that it is really about in his personnel .
accepterait them to assist in the city where i speak for all the fragmentation retirent to people who put their vehicles , and the community in these ?
m. marcel proulx :
mr. speaker , as i have mentioned the governments of federal inspectors and ontario behold regularly control , and i am told the contrary to what my colleague purports , it is quite does not regularly .
after our of inspectors , this is not the case , and the contrary , even rare that it is almost .

ms. judy wasylycia-leis ( winnipeg north centre , ndp ) :
mr. speaker , i am reading today to an issue that i asked the last 29 with the there may be alcoolisation foetale .
is that i am doive dual on this issue , mr. speaker , i would like on that i raised the same question to the house to many times since april 2001 when the house that was given his confident unanimous support in a private member 's motion that i had her regarding the passage of étiquettes application to be apposées before care about the contenants of alcoholic beverages to tell that the use of alcohol during pregnant there can be seeking to alcoolisation foetale .
that is and a half years and after the government had laid to intervene and that has had the parliament of commitment to canadians to take measures that in this sense , i am always is to ask what is happening in this matter ?
why the government does he not taken steps necessary to the wishes of parliament ?
i hope the government , i will not again its balivernes manner .
i should perhaps instead on the plan dictatorial .
i do not want to hear balivernes our dictature .
i would like to measures that are taken on this issue that is very chère to canadians , an issue of concern many people who live with the there must be alcoolisation syndrome and that all members of their families , their friends and their who know exactly promoters of what we are talking about .
we are talking about a problem extremely costly for the contribuable , because of the government 's inaction .
there is a alcoolisation foetale that , in the future , we can actually engendre costs of approximately $ 1 million per child gone .
how can it curable ?
in persuadant women not to not to alcohol during pregnant .
one of afford to use to do that will be to the implementation of étiquettes care about the bouteilles .
that is what we have done in other countries .
many other governments see that as a matter of policy the public interest .
our neighbours in brazil demand that all of contenants alcohol alcoolisée arborent an application care of this kind of ceo of the service of public health .
producers to alcohol , to vin keg and canadians are not they had not of these products will étiquettes on their ?
what we are doing is that the government has to say to the her clearly brasseurs , to the industry and distilleries have to be a little action to be greatly wants to share their entire community .
that is a measure that does not in the cost absolutely contribuable , which is the earnings will not like corporate an individual , but that will déterminante for the fight against the there to alcoolisation foetale in our society .
i know what i can to add hon. government and draw the attention .
the parliament to go back to unanimously a motion on the subject .
the support of that was 90 % of canadians are in favour of this measure résolument a simple , the money .
the corporate pédiatrie associations , and medical from alberta and from labrador , as well others have players written time and again to know why we are tardait to compete in this matter .
i urge again today to the government to take a measure important children canadians , to pass this motion very important and to make the need for the future of alcoolisation foetale there .
mr. jeannot castonguay ( parliamentary secretary to the minister of health , lib. ) :
mr. speaker , first i would like to make the efforts by the hon. member deployed to find a way to deal with the very seriously trouble of the spectre of fetal syndrome in canada , the tsaf .

the torts particular by the tsaf create some incapacités irréversibles congratulates everyone associated with any problems social affectives and financial , both for those who with that for families and the soignants .
these people requièrent support a few and that we have to take the steps representing from the most efficient and effective in the case .
our government recognized the complexity of emergency and the issue .
the overall strategy so many facettes review of the efficiency a antiquated avertissant the dangers of alcohol as the comprehensive approach to respect the tsaf .
you souviendrez , on the motion carried m-155 , through the house in april wanted to 2001 , why the government to consider the apposition to compel a clear imprimée label and visible on every contenants of alcoholic alcooliques that label off indiquant a message that do not have to alcohol during the pregnant can be seeking déficiences defects .
as he has been rapporté in the house , the information that we have obtenues up to do that we have not allowed to conclude that labelling prévenant the dangers of alcohol cancelling the impact that we see all be a change in the behaviour at risk of consuming alcohol during the of pregnant .
however , we continue to consult the research the most and reliable examine input of experts in this area .
our goal is to apply measures that use the advertisements in our resources and who will get to all helpful purposes , some positive results .
the government of canada was proactif in response to his question raised by the tsaf .
in 1999 , the funding was 11 amount of millions of dollars for the scope might and the number of projects communautaires under the program fashion , the canadian prénatale pcnp .
we have given a funding at the beginning of education and prevention on in the awareness of the public , to the taking getting , the development of the tools to practices pcnp to the what a funds to help projects building , a site center on the tsaf , to the surveillance , to the proper and to the with .
the funding has also served in the early , to the diagnoses identification and to the training , incluant the development of a manuel of training , called `` has manual saturday end community caring '' .
an investigation national professionals with some of the health care company was to determine the knowledge and attitudes with regard to the tsaf and the use of alcohol during the pregnant .
health canada publiera data in a number of formats , which will or improving the and the raising of training suppliers health care .
health canada also work with the representatives of centres diagnostics to prepare for canadians to make recommendations concerning guidelines normalisées for diagnoses acheminement and the people taking it .
this is the first step a process that mènera to the collection and the impact on the fréquence in canada .
we also to put up the advisory committee that we have floated national recommendations considerably on the issue of tsaf incluant , the use of étiquettes prévenant the dangers of alcohol as part of a comprehensive strategy and prevention .
in the budget of december 2001 , we have a petro announced amount of millions of dollars for 25 treating tsaf in the reserves , with our partners the first united .
the minister of health , is engagée to develop a action plan to the national tsaf , with our partners many .
the department of the upa are rassembler of the plan for all parts of canada who work in this area to achieve an action plan viable .
in a cautionary approach that can be released and collaborative on the with which the evidence rassembler where they and the best experience available on the strategies the more effective tsaf for the future .
in this context , we will invest in the efforts to fight the tsaf and providing a support for people , in the united states and their families , soignants communities .
ms. judy wasylycia-leis :
mr. speaker , i sympathise with the parliamentary secretary .
it has to be embarrassé , after read sornettes of such as the minister of health and his officials .
we have had already all hear .
what the member forgot to is that we have long considered issue before that my motion is the same time , and that the parliament not to use the simple cautionary unanimously in terms of will étiquettes warning to cover contenants of alcoholic beverages .
i know how the member can get up , which consider whether it is directly in the eyes and stop it comes to say with a once the integrity .
it should with back to the minister of health and for his department and their say that this is a word .
this type of dictature unacceptable .
what happens area what government ?
he is at this point in service in the country brasseurs ?
it depends on this point of donations at industry of alcoholic beverages ?
he making some ristournes ?
that is what prevents the government to pass any of a little for the future there to fetal syndrome ?
mr. jeannot castonguay :
mr. speaker , i will contained to be sure that you have my .
the minister of health is engagée to develop a national on the action plan tsaf .
in a cautionary approach that can be released and collaborative on with , which allows rassembler better than the evidence , the best experience available on the strategies the more effective tsaf for the future .
