mr. speaker , i am pleased that my colleague , as i , given his support in this bill , and i agree with the interpretation in fact he leaves his last speech .
i do not want to correct this that the member has said in his remarks , but to defend a point of view somewhat different .
in its lot , he said that the information would be fully available for the government .
he has given the example of its own family that it could from things on its ancêtres .
it is absolutely right on this .
but the purpose of the compromise between 92 years after 112 years is not help families who would be getting information on his past .
this is to reflect the cases where lend a family getting information on the past , another family .
as legislators , we have to look for again on this issue .
this is a real ear to understand that would 's privacy up in the end of . that is why i would argue that a professional to use , if i can tell , 92 years is a good amount of .
it should have been of procedures to access to information up to and , 92 years after 112 years , the information would be easy to access to the government .
i want to note that the member is that , as legislators , our role is not the preventing to have access to information on his family .
a in general , this is to protect the privacy of individuals who might be a that the information on their privacy never be allowed to private .
the deputy speaker :
the hon. member alluded to give the , i just remind the house that the period of government orders was severe for seven minutes , because of the time to a question given earlier in day .
we terminerons the government orders to 18 p.m. 37 this evening .
the hon. member for south shore has the floor .
mr. gerald keddy :
mr. speaker , i would like to thank the member for his question .
in fact , it was more a statement that a question and i am absolutely agreed on his declaration .
i have no trouble to agree with the fact that 92 years , it is a reasonable period of time for most of the information contained in the census records of concern .
i guess even more it and i would say that we did not need some additional 20 years beyond at that time .
after 92 years , to be a period of 20 years and the 112 years , it is opinion .
however , if it is a apaise ever-present or some of the questions that members of substantive or of members of the people have on this , so i do not have a problem , nor will .
after 112 years of stockage in their of information which are not private , if it wanted to , it does not to be released great concern is about the government .
i agree completely with the hon. member .
mr. brian masse ( windsor west , ndp ) :
mr. speaker , i am pleased , on behalf of the new democratic party , to support the bill s-13 .
i want to point out that the bill as it data and correcting a longstanding sour of the plan of the previous legislation .
the bill is also a model in our the treatment of the census records .
it was important to the report .
the census records are not only in the reasons for genealogical and historical , but also because they impact on the decisions that are now in this country .
the globe and mail article today released a called `` the statistics in ottawa value of the census permits a billion dollars '' .
section being in the census records irreparable of the last year .
the rearrangement of money is by the results through the census .
these results impact on the social policy , the government 's decisions affecting expenses , and the legislation that we are implementing all of the things that déterminent services to our country that provides for canadians .
bill s-13 would dissipate legal ambiguity resource review of census records are the facts over the years 1910 to 2003 .
it would allow the united states , genealogists and historical research experts to consult the returns of census , under certain conditions , for a period of 20 years enable 92 years after the census .
the important , and we sometimes trend with forget is that the bill also foundation which is the conditions appliqueront starting with the 2003 and that we will , as citizens , to decide whether the way we éclairée consentons to the release of information as the census .
i want to talk about a briefly now and i have to be addressed , the points out in the , including the company lockheed martin , which is one of the most important manufacturers multinationaux an arms , to ensure that the census information .
that is is not even a company canadian .
there is due to wonder if canadians will trust him enough for him to not only information concerning their age , but also starved sex and other issues concerning their phenomenon of life , in the information to be by the following the decision to decisions .
as far as this amendment , genealogists or their representatives should address it in the a encroaching to do that would information on base in the members of their own family , as name , including the age , marital status , or the date , sex , the connection with the leader of the family or her , in this country , on the family , instead of status , in the case of a immigrant , the year of its in canada , or the employment become .
it is very important that people can track released canadian forces .
it is not a rare that some people wanting to their member track to look for their family history of the reasons for health reasons , regarding historical or their status reasons related to them in their antécédents history cultural and , in the information that were electricity inaccessibles and that we want to now available .
that is the reasonable compromise which are reached the experts who have talked about this issue very sensitive respecting the protection of privacy protection .
before begin their business would that the experts for historical research are confirming the public and scientific nature of their research goes on in their peers or some of their sommités contaminants .
as i said , only tombstone information to be revealed .
if the conditions appliqueraient for a period of 20 years enable 92 years after the census .
at the end of the 112 years , the conditions publications , and the access to information and they would be given to do under any condition .
the period before 112 years can sembler long .
i hope that all those who are here and vivront until 112 years and they have a lifetime long and prospère .
this is not the case of everyone .
it could be that some people in their sign their that the information released , but on the other members that the majority of their families are communiquées with the data .
this is a very sensitive issue for a family members .
i know that i have to conclude , mr. speaker .
the deputy speaker :
the member has anticipé my involvement .
that is the period clôt s. today to the government orders .
the hon. member for windsor west will have to some 15,000 minutes when bill s-13 figurera again order of the day of business of the house .
adjournment proceedings
it is proposed to adjourn the house under standing in the standing order 38 deemed .
public safety
mr. brian masse ( windsor west , ndp ) :
mr. speaker , i see the floor in the house of commons argue again to the because of the city of windsor and its as frontalier .
there are over a year , the government constituted a plan with ontario and announced funds to 300 million .
then , to put up to a committee of 60,000 days and it took over a year to introduce this committee for what it was known as a plan nine issues .
my question today has to do that , right now , the city of windsor had an action plan as a access to , but it is a problem .
some 9 over trucks transportant prevalence of contents traversent .44 the border each year enfreignant at the time , the canadian laws and american .
this is given statistics in the province of ontario .
despite the and for the safety of industry , and the ministers of finance not have semblé in need of this issue .
we have a frontalier as for the contents prevalence of windsor and that is the traversier of trucks windsor-detroit , the fact that has been a pré-autorisation .
that is the only be in the country where the data on the contents prevalence are before the proceeds of something embarquement on the traversier .
in fact , this service of traversier received a $ host ridge under the legislation on the american security at home because of its activities .
there has been no of problems in 14 years .
what is quite is that many of the prevalence of contents trucks transportant members pont ambassador and contreviennent with the united states legislation .
the government did absolutely no into account the service of traversier in its regarding the plan will frontalier , in spite of the fact that it could be the transportation phenomenon of the more rapidly , the less onéreux and , more important again , to some of the most a equal matériaux franchissant the borders .
recently , a camion of gasoline has explosé on the louder i-75 detroit , at the michigan .
this could also have chosen to the pont ambassador .
there is no of security .
the trucks empruntent directly this pont and any what could done .
the frustration ressentie in my area is linked to the fact that there are many items in the program nine issues that the government has put in place on consensus , but they may not one that has not light on .
one has with respect to the facility for which it to prétraitement serviraient to allow the trucks .
the second on the service of traversier .
there is also for the question of passages piétons and various other things .
unfortunately , we have had a tragedy resulted recently with the death of a residing on the on heron church .
is that it has made in the campaign in mind so that it be passed in litigieux , the government will bouger in the case of the things that i have their consensus soulignés .
has to say that the minister of industry is accomplishments has come before the committee on industry .
he has said that the front ignores a whole .
he said that the government could do not have the facility for prétraitement before what it is a problem because it was dérouler and that is the same time we do bougerait in the case as he did not have met with new provincial ministers . that is more , there was municipal election .
not later that last week , the minister for international cooperation and essex said that the hon. member opposite we proposed implement measures for in the front and that of operations were ongoing .
we do not know where the government is the leadership us .
i would like to know why the government should go to the american enfreindre laws and to implement these people in the lives of my area by sheltering circulating patrol in our trucks transportant prevalence of contents of members of the pont .44 .
when will the government is not enough money for kicking the trucks to tough to places force .
why are we can be on the items in consensus ?
we have said that today , since the september 11 2001 , as the frontalier has come in that area of $ 100 million .
mr. marcel proulx ( parliamentary secretary to the minister of transport , lib. ) :
mr. speaker , at the outset , i would like to reassure canadians are the most clearly possible them saying that there is a dangerous situation marchandise acheminée .44 on the pont ambassador .
yes , the government decided to make significant improvements to the border infrastructure . the stakeholders with some of those trade and local are very business out there has been a long time .
the government of canada and the ontario have recently announced in the next few behind the implementation of the action plan regarding the will frontalier of windsor . they conservatives recognize the importance of economic and renovation needed to improve the approach to post frontaliers .
the federal government is committed to be part of the money for infrastructure border to the big business to improve the infrastructure to post frontaliers in that area of windsor .
