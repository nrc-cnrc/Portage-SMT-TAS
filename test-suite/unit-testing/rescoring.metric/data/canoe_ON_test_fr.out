the action plan regarding the will provide frontalier of windsor notably with the truck réfection system , the implementation of technologies that would ease the will of assurances and the improvement to access to the borders .
in september 2002 , the federal government and the ontario had announced investment a total of $ 300 million in the title of the improvement for the approach , side , as the ops frontalier windsor-detroit .
the federal government made up of money for infrastructure border .
the committee was a joint management role to examine the individual funds .
as i said earlier , the governments of canada and in ontario , on may have announced put , 2003 , the next few behind the action plan to the will frontalier of windsor .
the conditions of the money on infrastructure such as the border is only infrastructure land are expenses .
those are the government could have signed the kyoto agreement 25 september 2002 with a investing $ 300 million in on the next five years for the approach to improve the infrastructure means of as frontalier ops side of the borders .
i am pleased that the member opposite has raised this issue , given that the government has the prevalence of our that the transportation marchandises is fully should on the pont ambassador and that members of the camionneurs enlèvent indicateurs with on the marchandises prevalence of supermarkets at the delay or not be détours .
to go back to the issue that the member has raised in june , the taxation of the regulations to provide the prevalence transportation marchandises transportation and safer payments , they are transportées by traversier or by camion .
in the effect of their own private pont owners have regulations and the argument is not complete .
it is specific conditions such as the kind of and marchandises prevalence of as well for permitted and now of the day where those marchandises can go across the pont ambassador .
officials of customs sign their marchandises to meet the prevalence of two pont and to post a traverse .
the of customs officers vérifient if we still carries the prevalence of marchandises and if documents and a in jeopardy such as the affiches up to marchandises transportées .
we are told me that they have no problem was gardner in that regard .
the federal government and the department of transport in ontario their new a system that we could still regular and éclairs marchandises prevalence of . we have heard that it is a rare that we have said in jeopardy .
that is not the after the hasard , if i hope to say , but instead of inspectors made efforts by the federal and provincial et de la coopération for that industry .
mr. brian masse :
mr. speaker , it is just incredible .
we have seen many reports médiatiques so that a vidéo of chauffeurs of camion that they are running enlèvent fragmentation on their vehicles or that they are people who do regularly .
it is given practical .
we also street that we acceptons products that the dangerous remain in the patrol in our cities , while at the vehicles that are the forefront before the schools , the companies , and the domiciles because they did not access to a traversier .
it is ironic , because this service , the only in the country , and traduirait by the benefits immédiats , but the government in the discrimination and pay the services officials of customs .
the government is also the services to pay the brise-glace the american coast guard .
i would like to ask the parliamentary secretary , whether it is really about to its personnel .
accepterait them to assist in the city where i speak for all to people who retirent the fragmentation and put their vehicles as well as the community in these ?
mr. marcel proulx :
mr. speaker , as i have mentioned , the governments of federal inspectors and ontario behold regularly control , and i am told it purports contrary to what my colleague , it is quite does not regularly .
after our of inspectors , it is not the case , and the contrary , even rare that it is almost .

ms. judy wasylycia-leis ( winnipeg north centre , ndp ) :
mr. speaker , i am reading today to an issue that i asked the last 29 with the there may be alcoolisation foetale .
is that i am doive dual on this issue , mr. speaker , i would like on that i have the same question raised in the house to many times since april 2001 when the house that was given his confident unanimous support in a private member 's motion that i had her regarding the passage of étiquettes application to be apposées before care about the contenants of alcoholic beverages to tell that the use of alcohol during pregnant there may be seeking to alcoolisation foetale .
that is and a half years and after the government had laid to intervene and that the parliament has had the commitment to canadians to take measures that in this sense , i am always there to ask what is happening in this matter ?
why does the government does he not taken steps necessary to the wishes of parliament ?
i hope that the government will not do not remember again its balivernes manner .
i should be quite on the plan dictatorial .
i do not want to hear the balivernes of our dictature .
i would like to measures that are being taken on this issue that is very chère to canadians , an issue of concern many people who have to live with the there to alcoolisation syndrome so that all members of their families , their friends and their who know exactly promoters of what we are talking about .
we are talking about a problem extremely costly for the contribuable , in the inaction because of the government .
there is a alcoolisation foetale , the future , that we can actually engendre costs of approximately $ 1 million per child time .
how can we the future ?
in persuadant women not to not to alcohol during pregnant .
one of the ways to use to do that will be to the implementation of étiquettes care about the bouteilles .
that is what we are doing the other jurisdictions .
many other governments see that as a matter of policy of the public interest .
our neighbours in brazil demand that all of contenants alcohol alcoolisée arborent an application care of this kind of the ceo of the service of public health .
producers to alcohol , to vin keg and of canadians are not they had not of these products will étiquettes on their ?
what we are doing is that the government has to say to her clearly brasseurs , to the industry and have to be a little distilleries action to be greatly wants to share their entire community .
that is a measure that does not cost absolutely in contribuable , which is the earnings will not like corporate an individual , but that will déterminante for the fight against the there to alcoolisation foetale in our society .
i know what i can add hon. for the government and draw the attention .
the parliament to go back to the unanimously a motion on the subject .
that was the support of 90 % of canadians are in favour of this measure résolument a simple , with that .
some of companies pédiatrie associations , and medical from alberta and from labrador , as well others have players written time and again to know why we tardait to compete in this matter .
i urge again today the government to take a measure important children canadians , to pass this motion very important and to make the need for the future of alcoolisation foetale there .
mr. jeannot castonguay ( parliamentary secretary to the minister of health , lib. ) :
mr. speaker , first i would like to make the efforts by the hon. member deployed to find a way to deal with the very seriously trouble of the spectre of the fetal syndrome in canada , the tsaf .
i with her concern about the fact that it needs to take measures that is one of the causes of 's degeneration and of avoidable déficiences defects and the delay in the development of children canadians .
the torts particular by the tsaf create some incapacités irréversibles congratulates everyone associated with any problems social and financial affectives , both for those who with that for families and the soignants .
these people requièrent support a few and that we have to take the steps representing the from the most efficient and effective in the case .
our government recognized and the complexity of emergency about this issue .
the overall strategy so many facettes the review of the efficiency of a antiquated avertissant the dangers of alcohol as the comprehensive approach to respect the tsaf .
you souviendrez , on the motion carried m-155 , through the house in april wanted to 2001 , why the government to consider the apposition to compel a clear imprimée label and visible on every contenants of alcoholic alcooliques that label off indiquant a message that do not have to alcohol during the pregnant can be seeking déficiences defects .
as he has already been rapporté in the house , the information that we have obtenues up to do that we have not allowed to conclude that labelling prévenant the dangers of alcohol would have the impact that we see all be a change in the behaviour at risk of consuming alcohol during the of pregnant .
however , we continue to consult the research the most and reliable examine input of experts in this area .
our goal is to apply measures that use the most advertisements our resources and , which will get to all helpful purposes , some positive results .
the government of canada has been proactif in response to his question raised by the tsaf .
in 1999 , the funding was 11 amount of millions of dollars for the scope might and the number of projects communautaires under the program fashion , the canadian prénatale pcnp .
we have given a funding at the beginning of education and prevention on in the awareness of the public , to the taking getting , the development of the tools needed to practices pcnp , that of what a funds to help projects building , a site center on the tsaf , to the surveillance , to the proper and to the with .
the funding has also served in the early , the diagnoses identification and to the training , incluant the development of a manuel of training , called `` has manual saturday end community caring '' .
an investigation national professionals with some of the health care was company to determine the knowledge and the attitudes with regard to the tsaf and the use of alcohol during the pregnant .
health canada publiera data in a number of formats , which will be or to improve the and the raising of training suppliers health care .
health canada also working with the representatives of centres diagnostics to prepare for canadians to make recommendations concerning guidelines normalisées for the diagnoses acheminement and the people taking it .
this is the first step a process that mènera to the collection and the impact on the fréquence in canada .
we also , using the advisory committee on national that we have astounding considerably recommendations on the issue of tsaf incluant , the use of étiquettes prévenant the dangers of alcohol as part of a comprehensive strategy and prevention .
in the budget of december 2001 , we have a petro announced amount of millions of dollars for 25 adapt the tsaf in the reserves , with our partners the first united .
the minister of health is engagée to develop an action plan to the national tsaf , with our partners many .
if the department of the plan rassembler upa at all parts of canada 's who work in this area needed to achieve an action plan viable .
in a cautionary approach that can be released and collaborative on the with which allows the evidence of rassembler competent and the best experience available on the strategies the more effective tsaf for the future .
in this context , we will have put the efforts to fight the tsaf and providing a support for people , in the united states and their families , soignants communities .
ms. judy wasylycia-leis :
mr. speaker , i sympathise with the parliamentary secretary .
it has to be embarrassé , after read sornettes of such as the minister of health and for his officials .
we have had already all hear .
what the member forgot to say , is that we have long considered issue before that it is my motion before the same time and that parliament not to use the simple cautionary unanimously in terms of will étiquettes warning to cover contenants of alcoholic beverages .
i know how does the member can get up , which consider whether it is directly in the eyes stop and what it comes to say with a once the integrity .
it should be with back to the minister of health and for his department them and say that this is a word .
this kind of dictature unacceptable .
what happens here this government ?
it is at this point brasseurs serving some of the country ?
it depends on that point of donations the industry of alcoholic beverages ?
there are making ristournes ?
that is what stops the government to get a little for the future of that there is fetal syndrome ?
mr. jeannot castonguay :
mr. speaker , i will saying to be sure that you have my .
the minister of health is engagée to develop an action plan to the national tsaf .
in a cautionary approach that can be released and collaborative on the with , which allows rassembler better than the evidence , the best experience available on the strategies the more effective tsaf for the future .
