Has he seen the media reports ? 
Here I am today . 
Should I say from the dictatorship ? 
I do not want drivel from the dictatorship anymore . 
It is done in other countries . 
Mr. Speaker , it is short of incredible . 
So I would ask the parliamentary secretary , has he actually talked to his staff ? 
It is a matter of public policy in many other governments .
