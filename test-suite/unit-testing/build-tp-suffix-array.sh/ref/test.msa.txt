I would ask the parliamentary secretary , has he actually talked to his staff ?
I would like some action on an issue that is very important to Canadians , an issue that matters a great deal to people who have to live with fetal alcohol syndrome and to all the families and friends and supporters of people who have fetal alcohol syndrome and know exactly what we are talking about .
I would like to begin by praising the efforts expended by the hon. member in seeking an approach to the very serious problem of fetal alcohol syndrome .

In this context , we will continue in our efforts to combat FAS and to provide support to people , their families , care providers and communities .
Indeed , there are private rules imposed by the owners of the privately owned bridge .
Is it that dependent upon the alcohol industry for donations ?
Is it that much in the pockets of the brewers in this country ?
It also does not deal with the fact that we will allow those goods to sit on our city streets in lineups hour after hour in front of schools , businesses and residences because they are not diverted to the truck ferry service .
It costs about $ 1 million per person in the lifetime of a child to treat fetal alcohol syndrome , yet it is entirely preventable .
It is a matter of public policy in many other governments .
It is done in other countries .
It is in fact rare that it happens .
It is ironic , because this truck ferry service could actually provide some type of benefit immediately and the government is punishing it by making it pay for customs officials , the only one in the country .
It is preventable if we can convince women who are pregnant not to drink during their pregnancy .
It is something that happens all the time .
It will not cost taxpayers a penny and it is really not going to affect the bottom line of those liquor corporations , but it is going to make a tiny bit of difference in our persistent pursuit of the eradication of fetal alcohol syndrome in our society today .

The government also even makes them pay for the ferry ice breaking service that the U.S. Coast Guard does .
The minister is currently bringing together participants from all the parties in Canada , working in this area , to create a viable action plan .
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted .
The multi-faceted strategy includes a study of the effectiveness of warning labels as a total approach to FAS .
The terms and conditions of the border infrastructure fund are such that only land based infrastructure is eligible .
There are conditions which include the type , quantities , speeds and time of day under which one can carry dangerous goods across the Ambassador Bridge .
There is a regime of regular inspections plus occasional Transport Canada and Ontario joint transportation of dangerous goods inspection blitzes , which have shown that the removal of placards is a rare event .
These initiatives follow the memorandum of understanding signed on September 25 , 2002 , to provide $ 300 million over the next five years to upgrade infrastructure approaches on the Ontario side of the border .
These rules are not a total ban . There are conditions which include the type , quantities , speeds and time of day under which one can carry dangerous goods across the Ambassador Bridge .
They require ongoing support and our interventions must be as effective and efficient as possible .
This has not occurred by accident , if the House will excuse the turn of phrase , but is the result of a great deal of work by federal and provincial inspectors , and the industry has complied .
This kind of dictatorship is unacceptable .
This measure is the first stage in a process that will lead to the collection of data on the incidence and frequency of FAS in Canada .
This plan relies on a comprehensive , coordinated and cooperative approach that will bring together the best evidence and experience available on the most effective strategies for preventing FAS .
This plan relies on a comprehensive coordinated and cooperative approach that will bring together the best evidence and experience available on the most effective strategies for preventing FAS .
To refer to the matter the hon. member raised in June , the transportation of dangerous goods regulations require safe transportation of dangerous goods for all modes , whether the goods are being carried on a ferry or across the bridge .

Wasylycia-Leis :
We are , however , continuing to consult the most reliable studies and to examine the opinions of experts in this field .
We are talking about an issue that costs taxpayers an enormous amount of money because of the inaction of this government .
We had a motion passed almost unanimously by Parliament .
We have also formed a national advisory committee that will provide valuable recommendations on the issue of FAS , including the use of labels to warn about the risks of alcohol use , as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy .
We have had letter after letter from pediatric societies and from medical associations , from the Alberta Medical Association , the Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association and other organizations , asking why we are dragging our heels on this matter .
We have had several media reports , as well as footage of truck drivers admitting to taking their placards off or to knowing people who do that on a regular basis .
We have heard that all before .
We have provided funding for preventive , educational and public awareness activities , early intervention , the development of practical tools for the CPNP , the establishment of strategic project assistance fund , an FAS web site , monitoring , and coordination and collaboration .
We have surveys showing that 90 % of Canadians absolutely support this small measure .
What is going on with the government ?
What is stopping the government from taking one small step toward the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome ?
What the member forgets to mention is that this issue was studied long before my motion came on the books and long before Parliament gave almost unanimous support for a simple measure to put warning labels on alcohol beverage containers .
Why has the government not taken the necessary steps to implement the will of Parliament ?
