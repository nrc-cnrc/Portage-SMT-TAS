			Oktoberfest

 Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.): 

	Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to extend an invitation to all Canadians to visit my community of Kitchener to celebrate Oktoberfest. This is North America's largest Bavarian festival and it celebrates Kitchener's German heritage.

	 People can come and polka the night away at one of the city's festhallen, join in the spirit of gemütlichkeit at  the Oktoberfest Thanksgiving Day parade, and enjoy numerous cultural events. We are especially proud this year to host a Canadian great, Stompin' Tom Connors,  as part of this year's festival.

	 The past 35 years have seen Oktoberfest host  thousands of visitors from around the world.  This year over 700,000 people will enjoy the festival and $18 million will be injected into our community.

	 It is a demonstration of Canadian hospitality of which Kitchener is very proud. I invite all hon. members to join me as we tap the keg and welcome everyone to this great Canadian  festival. Ein Prosit.

	Breast Cancer Foundation

 Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ): 

	Today I am proudly wearing the pink ribbon of the Breast Cancer Foundation. It recently announced at a press conference I attended some facts about its most important fundraising activity. For seven years now, the foundation has organized the CIBC Run for the Cure in a number of cities. It included Quebec City for the first time this year. This event gives thousands of people an opportunity to walk or run to raise funds for this cause.

	 Because each week 100 women in Quebec are diagnosed with breast cancer and 28 die, and because everyone is affected, the foundation deserves our support for its mission to finance research, develop prevention programs, and offer various support services to women with breast cancer.

	 Last Sunday, the Quebec City Run for the Cure was a great success with 1,200 registrants and over $113,000 raised. The Bloc Quebecois congratulates everyone associated with this event and sends its wishes for a speedy recovery to all women with breast cancer.
