The Windsor gateway action plan includes upgrades to the road network , along with the deployment of technologies that will facilitate the flow of traffic and enhance access to the border . 
In September 2002 , the federal and Ontario governments announced a total of $ 300 million to improve approaches on the Ontario side of the Windsor-Detroit border crossing . 
The federal portion comes from the border infrastructure fund . 
A joint management committee has been tasked to examine how the funds should be allocated . 
As I mentioned earlier , on May 27 , 2003 , the Governments of Canada and Ontario announced the next step in the implementation of the Windsor gateway action plan . 
The terms and conditions of the border infrastructure fund are such that only land based infrastructure is eligible . 
These initiatives follow the memorandum of understanding signed on September 25 , 2002 , to provide $ 300 million over the next five years to upgrade infrastructure approaches on the Ontario side of the border . 
I am actually pleased that the hon. member opposite has raised this question , as there has indeed been a public perception that dangerous goods are totally banned from the Ambassador Bridge and that truck drivers remove dangerous goods placards in order to avoid delays or detours . 
To refer to the matter the hon. member raised in June , the transportation of dangerous goods regulations require safe transportation of dangerous goods for all modes , whether the goods are being carried on a ferry or across the bridge . 
Indeed , there are private rules imposed by the owners of the privately owned bridge . 
These rules are not a total ban .  There are conditions which include the type , quantities , speeds and time of day under which one can carry dangerous goods across the Ambassador Bridge . 
Customs officials accept dangerous goods at both the bridge and ferry crossings . 
Customs officers always check whether dangerous goods are carried and whether the documents and the safety marks , such as placards , are consistent with the goods being carried . 
I have been informed that no problems have been reported . 
There is a regime of regular inspections plus occasional Transport Canada and Ontario joint transportation of dangerous goods inspection blitzes , which have shown that the removal of placards is a rare event . 
This has not occurred by accident , if the House will excuse the turn of phrase , but is the result of a great deal of work by federal and provincial inspectors , and the industry has complied . 
Mr. Brian Masse : 
Mr. Speaker , it is nothing short of incredible . 
We have had several media reports , as well as footage of truck drivers admitting to taking their placards off or to knowing people who do that on a regular basis . 
It is something that happens all the time . 
It also does not deal with the fact that we will allow those goods to sit on our city streets in lineups hour after hour in front of schools , businesses and residences because they are not diverted to the truck ferry service . 
It is ironic , because this truck ferry service could actually provide some type of benefit immediately and the government is punishing it by making it pay for customs officials , the only one in the country . 
The government also even makes them pay for the ferry ice breaking service that the U.S. Coast Guard does . 
The U.S. Coast Guard provides that service .  So I would ask the parliamentary secretary , has he actually talked to his staff ? 
Has he seen the media reports ?  Would he want to come to my community and talk to the people who are taking off the placards and putting our community at risk ? 
Mr. Marcel Proulx : 
Mr. Speaker , as I mentioned before , inspectors from the Canadian government and the Ontario government carry out regular inspections , and I am informed that this does not occur .  According to what my hon. colleague is saying , this is happening on a regular basis . 
According to our inspectors , it is not happening on a regular basis .  It is in fact rare that it happens .

Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today I am referring to a question I asked on May 29 specifically regarding fetal alcohol syndrome . 
Although I have to refer to that one question , Mr. Speaker , I want you to know that I have raised this question repeatedly in the House since April 2001 , when in fact this place gave almost unanimous support to a private member 's motion I introduced requiring labels on all alcohol beverage containers , which were to state a warning that drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome . 
Here I am today , two and a half years after the government promised to act , after this place , Parliament , made a commitment to the people of Canada that it would act ; here I am , asking again , where is the action ? 
Why has the government not taken the necessary steps to implement the will of Parliament ? 
I hope that I do not get the usual drivel from the government . 
Or should I say from the dictatorship ? 
I do not want drivel from the dictatorship anymore . 
I would like some action on an issue that is very important to Canadians , an issue that matters a great deal to people who have to live with fetal alcohol syndrome and to all the families and friends and supporters of people who have fetal alcohol syndrome and know exactly what we are talking about . 
We are talking about an issue that costs taxpayers an enormous amount of money because of the inaction of this government . 
It costs about $ 1 million per person in the lifetime of a child to treat fetal alcohol syndrome , yet it is entirely preventable . 
How is it preventable ? 
It is preventable if we can convince women who are pregnant not to drink during their pregnancy . 
One way we can do that is to put labels on bottles saying that there is a problem if they drink when they are pregnant . 
It is done in other countries . 
It is a matter of public policy in many other governments . 
For our neighbours to the south of us , it is a requirement that all alcohol beverage containers have such a warning from the Surgeon General . 
Obviously , Canadian manufacturers of liquor , wine and beer who want to export to the United States have to put those labels on the bottles , do they not ? 
All we are asking is for the government to have the courage to stand up to the brewers , to the liquor industry and to the alcohol corporations and say that there is one small thing they can do for the good of all . 
It will not cost taxpayers a penny and it is really not going to affect the bottom line of those liquor corporations , but it is going to make a tiny bit of difference in our persistent pursuit of the eradication of fetal alcohol syndrome in our society today . 
I do not know what else I can say to the government to make it wake up and take notice . 
We had a motion passed almost unanimously by Parliament . 
We have surveys showing that 90 % of Canadians absolutely support this small measure . 
We have had letter after letter from pediatric societies and from medical associations , from the Alberta Medical Association , the Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association and other organizations , asking why we are dragging our heels on this matter . 
I ask again today .  I plead with the government to do what is important for the children of this land and bring in this very important motion and ensure that we do everything we can to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome . 
Mr. Jeannot Castonguay ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to begin by praising the efforts expended by the hon. member in seeking an approach to the very serious problem of fetal alcohol syndrome . 
I share her concerns about the necessity of taking steps to address one of the major avoidable causes of congenital defects and developmental delay in Canadian children . 
FAS results in irreversible disabilities associated with social , emotional and financial difficulties for those with the syndrome as well as their families and caregivers . 
They require ongoing support and our interventions must be as effective and efficient as possible . 
Our government acknowledges the complex and urgent nature of this issue . 
The multi-faceted strategy includes a study of the effectiveness of warning labels as a total approach to FAS . 
Hon. members will recall that Motion M-155 , passed by this House in April 2001 , called upon the government to consider the advisability of requiring all alcoholic beverages to carry a visible and clearly printed label warning that drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause birth defects . 
As has already been reported to the House , the information we have obtained so far has not allowed us to conclude that labels warning of the dangers of alcohol use would have the impact we all want to see , namely a change in the risky behaviour of drinking during pregnancy . 
We are , however , continuing to consult the most reliable studies and to examine the opinions of experts in this field . 
Our objective is to apply measures that make the most efficient use of our resources while obtaining outcomes that are as positive as possible , ultimately . 
The Government of Canada has been proactive in its response to FAS-related issues . 
In 1999 funding was increased by $ 11 million in order to expand the number and scope of community projects under CPNP , the Canadian prenatal nutrition program . 
We have provided funding for preventive , educational and public awareness activities , early intervention , the development of practical tools for the CPNP , the establishment of strategic project assistance fund , an FAS web site , monitoring , and coordination and collaboration . 
Funding was also used for early detection , diagnosis and training , including the development of a training manual entitled A Manual for Community Caring . 
A national survey of health care professionals was undertaken to identify knowledge and attitudes with respect to FAS and the use of alcohol during pregnancy . 
Health Canada will publish its findings in a number of formats that will be used to improve the education and training of health care providers . 
Health Canada is also working with representatives from Canadian diagnostic centres to prepare recommendations for standardized guidelines with respect to diagnosis and patient referral . 
This measure is the first stage in a process that will lead to the collection of data on the incidence and frequency of FAS in Canada . 
We have also formed a national advisory committee that will provide valuable recommendations on the issue of FAS , including the use of labels to warn about the risks of alcohol use , as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy . 
In the December 2001 budget we announced an additional $ 25 million to treat FAS on reserves , in cooperation with our first nations partners . 
The Minister of Health has promised to develop a national action plan on FAS in cooperation with our many partners . 
The minister is currently bringing together participants from all the parties in Canada , working in this area , to create a viable action plan . 
This plan relies on a comprehensive coordinated and cooperative approach that will bring together the best evidence and experience available on the most effective strategies for preventing FAS . 
In this context , we will continue in our efforts to combat FAS and to provide support to people , their families , care providers and communities . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis : 
Mr. Speaker , I feel sorry for the parliamentary secretary . 
He must be embarrassed after reading such drivel from the Minister of Health and her departmental officials . 
We have heard that all before . 
What the member forgets to mention is that this issue was studied long before my motion came on the books and long before Parliament gave almost unanimous support for a simple measure to put warning labels on alcohol beverage containers . 
I do not know how the member can stand in his place , look anyone straight in the eye and say what he just said with any kind of integrity . 
He should go back to the Minister of Health and the department and say that this is outrageous . 
This kind of dictatorship is unacceptable . 
What is going on with the government ? 
Is it that much in the pockets of the brewers in this country ? 
Is it that dependent upon the alcohol industry for donations ? 
Are payoffs going on ? 
What is stopping the government from taking one small step toward the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome ? 
Mr. Jeannot Castonguay : 
Mr. Speaker , I shall repeat what I said to be sure that you understood . 
The Minister of Health has promised to develop a national action plan on FAS . 
This plan relies on a comprehensive , coordinated and cooperative approach that will bring together the best evidence and experience available on the most effective strategies for preventing FAS . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted . 
Accordingly , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24(1) . 
( The House adjourned at 6:55 p.m. )
