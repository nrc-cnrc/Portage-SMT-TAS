the house resumed from april 9 , 2003 , consideration of the motion that bill c-420 , an act to amend the food and drugs act be now read the second time and referred to a committee . 
ms. diane bourgeois ( terrebonne -- blainville , bq ) : 
mr. speaker , this morning we are beginning the last hour of debate at second reading of bill c-420 , an act to amend the food and drugs act , put forward by our hon. colleague from the canadian alliance . 
let us remember that in 1997 the house of commons standing committee on health was given a mandate to study all aspects of the issue of legislating natural health products . 
the committee was charged with holding consultations , making analyses and formulating recommendations concerning the legislative and regulatory regime governing traditional medicines , homeopathic preparations , and vitamin and mineral supplements . 
the committee was also expected to consult broadly with stakeholders , including associations , individuals representing consumers , manufacturers , distributors , growers , importers , exporters and retailers . 
we see that this bill , like the committee 's mandate , has reached a great many individuals who were very concerned about the regulation of natural health products . 
the committee held many hearings , heard many witnesses , and came to the realization that regulation of natural products was very controversial . 
many of the witnesses lobbied to have the regulations governing natural health products changed . 
consequently , the committee members said that it was more than time to review the entire issue , which they did . 
the same year , a health canada survey showed that 56 % of canadians had used natural health products in the previous six months . 
thus we can see that canadians and quebeckers are taking more responsibility for their own health and in many cases , this leads to increased interest in and demand for natural health products . 
the committee concluded -- it set out parameters -- that natural health products have their own unique characteristics and must not be treated strictly as either food or pharmaceutical products . 
moreover , the committee said that natural health product regulations must not unduly restrict access by consumers . 
in addition , it concluded that the authority for decision-making must be given to a regulatory body that has dedicated expertise and experience with natural health products and that natural health product regulatoryapproaches must respect diverse cultural traditions . 
these four principles listed by the committee led to the request for the creation of another committee , which could draft legislation on the matter . 
the bill before us today does not in any way reflect the safeguards or points of reference the committee set out . 
the standing committee on health would have liked the current act to be changed because , as it now stands , a natural product can be considered a food or a drug . 
the standing committee on health , which received the mandate to study the act , said that natural foods should come under a third category . 
they have their peculiarities and particularities and , thus , an act respecting food and drugs should not include them . 
unfortunately , the bill before us does not correspond with what the standing committee on health had decided . 
what we are saying is that a third category absolutely must be created for products that should truly be identified by skilled people . 
currently , everyone -- whether at health canada or in the general public -- claims to know the benefits or inconveniences of natural health foods . 
unfortunately , far too often , people do not know what impact these might have . 
in 1997 or 1998 , the standing committee on health had said it would be better if the legislation required us to form a committee with specialists . 
thus , a third category must be created for natural health products . 
this is one of the conclusions of the report of the standing committee on health .  again , to the committee , natural products are neither food nor drugs . 
the report stated that regulations alone are not sufficient and that statutory amendments should be made as soon as possible . 
the report also indicated that the majority of witnesses who appeared before the committee had reached this same conclusion .
