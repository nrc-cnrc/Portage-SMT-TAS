all research projects are subject to an assessment of their scientific and public value . 
there are conditions and criteria to ensure that , ultimately , this bill will take into consideration the provisions included in previous legislation . 
it also takes into account changes that have occurred over the last century . 
however , there is also a legislative provision so that individuals who do not wish to release such data will be protected for life . 
i think that , consequently , this is an acceptable compromise . 
mr. gerald keddy ( south shore , pc ) : 
mr. speaker , it is a pleasure to rise to speak today to bill s-13 .  it is a bill on which many members of parliament have been lobbied . 
certainly , there is a need to open up the census information . 
i do not think there was an intent , at least the professional panel never found an intent , under the original wording to protect information in perpetuity .
