The three files tplm, cbk and tdx, together, constitute a single TPLM model.
You must keep them together in a directory called NAME.tplm for the model to
work properly.  They cannot be used compressed.

To use this model in any Portage program, provide the directory name NAME.tplm
anywhere you would normally provide an LM file name.
