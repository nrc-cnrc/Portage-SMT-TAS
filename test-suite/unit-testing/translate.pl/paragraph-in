Forget Hollywood, Disneyland and Silicon Valley. Get ready to see a very different California. Deep in the grip of an epic drought, the Golden State is looking a lot like the Dust Bowl these days. And there's no shortage of finger-pointing and drought shaming.
A drought of historic proportions and the hottest year ever recorded have compelled California to impose unprecedented water consumption reductions.  Celebrities and ranchers alike have been accused of stealing water. Things aren't going well as California siphons off massive amounts from its few remaining wetlands and its sluggish rivers. Things are so bad that it's reaching down deep to drain its aquifers of water that's sat undisturbed since
the end of the last Ice Age, some 20,000 years ago.
Nick Eyles in California.
RUNNING ON EMPTY is the story of a natural disaster and how Californians are responding as they face a water level that is dropping to zero. Suddenly, hard questions are being asked. Where did all the water go?  Who's fault is it? And what needs to change to save California from itself?
RUNNING ON EMPTY, and its host Canadian scientist Nick Eyles, take a road trip to examine how California drained its oasis dry and ignored decades of accepted water wisdom. Now, the state is facing a stark, new reality - there simply isn't enough water to go around.
