                     PORTAGEshared toy experiment data

This directory is not a real unit test suite, it simply holds the data for
running the toy experiment using our experiment framework.  See
framework/frameword-toy.pdf for details.

The *.al files come from three days of preprocessed Canadian Hansard
proceedings: House of Commons Debates, Oct 8, 9 and 20, 2003.  These were
originally downloaded from the website of the Parliament of Canada,
