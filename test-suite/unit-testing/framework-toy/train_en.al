37th PARLIAMENT , 2nd SESSION EDITED HANSARD -- NUMBER 136 
OFFICIAL REPORT ( HANSARD ) 
Wednesday , October 8 , 2003 Speaker : The Honourable Peter Milliken 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Prayers 
The Speaker : 
As is our practice on Wednesday we will now sing O Canada , and we will be led by the hon. member for Sackville -- Musquodoboit Valley -- Eastern Shore . 
STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
Mental Health 
Mr. Dominic LeBlanc ( Beauséjour -- Petitcodiac , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to acknowledge the dedicated work of Robert MacKay of Grand Barachois , New Brunswick , in promoting awareness and compassion for those Canadians who suffer with mental illness . 
Robert has shown much courage and determination in addressing the many difficulties facing Canadians who live with mental health challenges . 
He has appeared at the New Brunswick legislature to call for stronger client-run and family-run programs and he has campaigned for an end to the many discriminations faced daily by people with these illnesses . 
Robert MacKay is a man of courage and determination . 
I salute his devotion to these people who are in such need of our support and compassion . 
Infrastructure Funding 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay -- Columbia , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , under the regime of the former finance minister , Canadians pay $ 7 billion in federal gasoline taxes each year . 
This averages out to $ 222 per Canadian , of which only $ 9 is directed back to infrastructure funding . 
For years the Canadian Alliance has attempted to get the former finance minister to treat municipalities with respect . 
He changed the meaning of the phrase `` all politics is local '' by attaching federal and provincial strings to municipal infrastructure spending . 
Now that he is one of two prime ministers in Canada , he has been embarrassed into supporting the Canadian Alliance motion calling on the federal government to initiate new discussions with provinces and territories to provide municipalities with a portion of the federal gas tax . 
Last month the Liberal leader was very vague and noncommittal when he announced he would consider such a transfer . 
In contrast , the Canadian Alliance is specific . 
We would give annually $ 2 billion of tax room to municipalities so they could make intelligent local decisions about their infrastructure requirements . 
World Sight Day 
Mr. Gurbax Malhi ( Bramalea -- Gore -- Malton -- Springdale , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the worldwide economic cost of blindness and low vision has been estimated to be $ 25 billion U.S. , according to Vision 2020 . 
A major object of Vision 2020 is to prevent the world 's blind population swelling from its present level of 45 million to the projected total of 72 million . 
All of Canada 's World Sight Day organizers support this goal through ongoing programs . 
Christian Blind Mission International provides funds and personnel to restore and save sight and enable those who are permanently disabled . 
ORBIS operates the world 's only flying eye hospital . 
The Canadian National Institute for the Blind provides Canadians who are blind , visually impaired and deaf-blind with a variety of services , including orientation and mobility training , vision rehabilitation , technical aids , counselling and referral , and career development and employment . 
I would like to invite all my fellow MPs to mark World Sight Day on Thursday , October 9 , at 12:30 , with a gathering outside on the steps in front of Centre Block . 
World Sight Day 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Oak Ridges , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , World Sight Day will be celebrated on October 9 in over 100 countries , including right here on the steps of Parliament Hill . 
With vision loss affecting 180 million worldwide , organizers of this year 's World Sight Day on Parliament Hill are asking for greater support in combating the tragedy of avoidable blindness . 
It is estimated that 80 % of the world 's blindness is avoidable : either preventable or curable . 
In fact , both the causes and cures are known and we are even aware of what steps to take . 
The Canadian National Institute for the Blind and its sister blindness organizations , both in Canada and worldwide , require our resources to ensure that blindness treatment and prevention are indeed a part of national health programs . 
In Canada , the leading causes of blindness , which are macular degeneration , glaucoma and cataracts , are all age related . 
As the Canadian population ages , there will be a higher demand for resources to meet the needs of blind , visually impaired and deaf-blind Canadians . 
I would therefore invite all of my colleagues to participate in World Sight Day activities planned for Thursday , October 9 . 
Activities begin outside on the steps of Parliament Hill at 12:30 and are followed by a reception in the Commonwealth Room . 
Robert Short 
Hon. Andy Scott ( Fredericton , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , everyone in Canada was saddened to learn of the tragic deaths of two of our Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan on Thursday , October 2 . 
One of the soldiers , Sergeant Robert Short , was from Charters Settlement , just outside Fredericton . 
This tragic event has affected people across our country . 
Yesterday , in Pembroke , Ontario , more than 3,000 civilians and soldiers paid tribute to Sergeant Short and Corporal Robbie Beerenfenger . 
This Saturday , approximately 400 members of Sergeant Short 's battalion at CFB Gagetown will gather at a graveside ceremony . 
Not only was Sergeant Short a soldier , he was a friend , a father and a husband . 
I offer my sincere condolences to his family and friends . 
The community of greater Fredericton and in fact the entire country share in their sorrow . 
Canada 's military personnel make an invaluable contribution to help ensure that our world is a safer place . 
Their sacrifice is immense . 
I pay tribute to all of them . 
Papal Anniversary 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , October 16 will mark the 25th anniversary of the election of Karol Wojtyla to the papacy as Pope John Paul II , making him the third longest serving pope in the 2,000 year history of the Catholic church . 
Since that time , he has been perhaps the most active apostle of the Christian message of hope and human dignity ever , travelling on over 100 foreign missions and testifying in person to hundreds of millions , on every continent . 
A personal witness to the great horrors of totalitarianism in what he calls the `` century of tears '' , the Pope has fearlessly spoken truth to power . 
His message of solidarity and freedom was the spiritual spark that led to the fall of the Iron Curtain , and it energized the spread of democracy from Latin America to the Philippines . 
He has continued to preach his message of the divine origin of human dignity against post-modern distortions of freedom , the excesses of materialism , and the culture of death . 
Now coming to the end of his service , he offers a heroic witness . 
Burdened by crippling infirmities , he is a sign of hope to the elderly and the disabled . 
On behalf of all Canadians , let us offer to John Paul II our gratitude , our prayers and our congratulations on this , his anniversary . 
Oktoberfest 
Mrs. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to extend an invitation to all Canadians to visit my community of Kitchener to celebrate Oktoberfest . 
This is North America 's largest Bavarian festival and it celebrates Kitchener 's German heritage . 
People can come and polka the night away at one of the city 's festhallen , join in the spirit of gemütlichkeit at the Oktoberfest Thanksgiving Day parade , and enjoy numerous cultural events . 
We are especially proud this year to host a Canadian great , Stompin ' Tom Connors , as part of this year 's festival . 
The past 35 years have seen Oktoberfest host thousands of visitors from around the world . 
This year over 700,000 people will enjoy the festival and $ 18 million will be injected into our community . 
It is a demonstration of Canadian hospitality of which Kitchener is very proud . 
I invite all hon. members to join me as we tap the keg and welcome everyone to this great Canadian festival . 
Ein Prosit . 
Breast Cancer Foundation 
Ms. Christiane Gagnon ( Québec , BQ ) : 
Today I am proudly wearing the pink ribbon of the Breast Cancer Foundation which recently announced at a press conference I attended some facts about its most important fundraising activity . 
For seven years now , the foundation has organized the CIBC Run for the Cure in a number of cities , including Quebec City for the first time this year .  This event gives thousands of people an opportunity to walk or run to raise funds for this cause . 
Because each week 100 women in Quebec are diagnosed with breast cancer and 28 die , and because everyone is affected , the foundation deserves our support for its mission to finance research , develop prevention programs , and offer various support services to women with breast cancer . 
Last Sunday , the Quebec City Run for the Cure was a great success with 1,200 registrants and over $ 113,000 raised . 
The Bloc Quebecois congratulates everyone associated with this event and sends its wishes for a speedy recovery to all women with breast cancer . 
Izzy Asper 
Mr. John Harvard ( Charleswood -- St. James -- Assiniboia , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to Israel `` Izzy '' Asper . 
His death marks the passing of a remarkable man . 
He was a man of great empathy and compassion who was passionate about his city of Winnipeg , and he gave to it with his time , energy and money . 
Izzy was a visionary who believed in Winnipeg and he leaves his fingerprints all over it . 
An amazing philanthropist , Izzy was a patron of the arts , sports and education . 
He gave to them all and challenged others to do the same . 
However , the legacy that he leaves with us is not only his philanthropy but his spirit , humanity and friendship . 
Izzy Asper was a champion of the west , a talented businessman and a clever attorney . 
He was a proud and loyal Liberal , but perhaps above all , a loving father and husband . 
Izzy was a man who never forgot where he came from and never compromised on where he was going . 
His death is stunning . 
Winnipeg and Manitoba have lost a giant of a man whose legacy is almost everywhere in the city of Winnipeg . 
He will be greatly missed . 
On behalf of my colleagues , I offer my condolences . 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency 
Mrs. Lynne Yelich ( Blackstrap , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , add another well-heeled Liberal to the growing list of ACOA Atlantic innovation fund recipients . 
John Bragg , uncle to former Nova Scotia MLA Ross Bragg and well known Liberal Party supporter , recently received an innovation fund grant for his company , Oxford Frozen Foods . 
In addition , Mr. Bragg has been listed by Canadian Business Magazine as one of Canada 's hundred richest people . 
On top of that , Mr. Bragg recently contributed $ 50,000 to the next Liberal leader 's campaign . 
Corporate welfare is alive and well in Canada and the Liberals are responsible . 
Why are taxpayer dollars being exposed to a risk that should be shouldered by one of the wealthier businessmen in Canada ? 
While the government does play a part in promoting economic growth , that role should not be picking winners and losers through grants . 
Izzy Asper 
Ms. Anita Neville ( Winnipeg South Centre , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday one of my constituents passed away . 
I know I speak for all Winnipeggers when I say we profoundly mourn the passing of Israel Asper , one of the most ardent supporters of Winnipeg . 
Izzy was an unusual constituent . 
His support was constant . 
His comments and his advice were pithy , forthright and always wise . 
I shall miss our conversations about his vision for Winnipeg and Manitoba . 
For Izzy truly loved and championed his hometown . 
His legacy is everywhere , in the arts , in education , in sports and in his beloved Jewish community . 
What an extraordinary life he led , a lawyer , a media tycoon , a businessman , a politician , a jazz aficionado , a builder of Israel , a philanthropist , a devoted family man and most recently , the champion of the Canadian Museum of Human Rights to be built at the historical Forks in Winnipeg . 
He will be profoundly missed by his family . 
I offer my deepest sympathy to Babs , David , Gail and Leonard . 
Pesticides 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy -- Royal , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the environment commissioner warned of a major environmental health crisis over government mishandling of pesticides . 
The government has ignored the commissioner 's call for an overhaul of the way pesticides are handled in this country , an appeal that she has made four times since 1993 . 
The Liberal government has failed to ensure that current pesticides meet basic standards . 
It has only re-evaluated 2 % of the current pesticides , leaving well over 400 that need to be addressed . 
In each case the pesticides that have been reviewed either have been pulled off the market or have had further restrictions added to them . 
What is more , the government is irresponsibly registering over 50 % of all new pesticides with temporary permits , skipping critical steps in their evaluation . 
The Prime Minister is leaving a toxic legacy that he should be very ashamed of . 
His legacy will not be one of protecting the health and safety and the environment of Canadians . 
Congregation of Sisters of Sainte Anne 
Mr. Roger Gaudet ( Berthier -- Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to draw the attention of the House to a decisive event in the history of the municipality of Saint-Jacques de Montcalm . 
It was 150 years ago , on August 23 , 1853 , that Mother Marie-Anne and her 27 followers arrived in Saint-Jacques de Montcalm , after a long and perilous two-day voyage from Vaudreuil , where the Congregation of the Sisters of Sainte Anne had been founded in 1850 by Esther Blondin , who later took the name Marie-Anne . 
This exceptional woman was beatified by Pope John Paul II on April 29 , 2001 . 
A dinner in honour of the anniversary of the arrival of the Sisters of Sainte Anne was held on September 6 .  More than 400 people attended this event to commemorating the congregation 's 150 years of history . 
The Saint-Jacques boarding school , founded in 1853 , eventually grew into the Collège Esther-Blondin in 1996 , a private secondary school offering an international education to girls and boys , at last fulfilling Mother Marie-Anne's dream of coeducational schools for poor rural children . 
In recognition of this great religious figure -- 
The Speaker : 
The hon. member for St. Catharines . 
St. Catharines Canadian Polish Society 
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( St. Catharines , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to offer my congratulations to the St. Catharines Canadian Polish Society on the 75th anniversary of its founding . 
The St. Catharines Polish Society 's first meeting took place in May 1928 .  Its charter was granted on November 17 , 1928 . 
Mr. S. Konopka , Mr. L. Skoczylas , Mr. A. Shynel , Mr. A. Dutka and Mr. A. Glowacki were named charter members . 
Members decided that the club needed its own hall or home .  An empty lot off Facer Street was bought in March 1929 for $ 200 . 
Everyone 's hard work paid off and on October 11 , 1942 Dom Polski was officially opened . 
In September 1979 Polonia Park became the official name of the farm property that had been acquired for use by the club . 
In January 1988 then president Leo Skorski introduced a new undertaking that would see the club construct the I. Paderewski Society Home for seniors , which opened in March 1991 . 
The club continues to focus on socio-cultural and recreational activities . 
Congratulations to all those who have played a part in the success of the St. Catharines Canadian Polish Society . 
Violence Against Women 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , missing women and unsolved women 's murders , especially those working in the high risk sex trade , seem to be a low priority across Canada . 
In Vancouver a horrific 61 unsolved murder cases built up before it became an issue . 
In Edmonton there have been 22 cases . 
Now in Winnipeg the tragic death of Valicia Solomon has focused attention on 13 unsolved murders on the books there and has raised the spectre of either a serial killer or 13 murderers being on the loose . 
Is there a systemic problem in law enforcement with a blind spot to missing and murdered women ? 
Is the federal government paying attention to these disturbing numbers ? 
Women victims seem to be a low priority until we reach a critical mass of dead bodies . 
Women in Winnipeg and across Canada want to know , what is the critical mass necessary before this government takes action to better protect women 's lives ? 
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
Gasoline Taxes 
Mr. Stephen Harper ( Leader of the Opposition , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last night the House finally passed an Alliance motion to give a share of federal gas taxes to the municipalities . 
The motion was passed with a majority of the House , with the vast majority of Liberal members supporting it , with the vast majority of the cabinet supporting it , despite the longstanding opposition of the heritage minister , finance minister and Prime Minister . 
My question is very simple . 
Could the Prime Minister now clarify for us , is it now the policy of the federal government to give gas taxes to municipalities or is it not ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member would read the motion , we said we were to discuss it with the provinces . 
I read the motion . 
It was his party 's motion and if he does not read his party 's own motion , what can I do ? 
The motion says that we should engage in a discussion with the provincial governments about it . 
Of course I do not mind discussing it with the provinces . 
Some provinces might not be in agreement . 
If all the provinces were to be in agreement , it might be easier . 
What would be the reaction in Quebec where there is a law that prevents the municipalities from accepting money from the federal government ? 
Mr. Stephen Harper ( Leader of the Opposition , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am glad to see the Prime Minister read the motion , even if he did not vote on it . 
I will point out that it does say to initiate discussions with the provinces and territories to provide the municipalities with a share of federal tax . 
My question is very simple . 
Has the Prime Minister contacted the provinces ? 
When will he do so ? 
When will he initiate these discussions ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , even before , I met last week with Premier Charest and we discussed that . 
I met with Premier Doer in Winnipeg and we mentioned that . 
It is possible when I met a few days ago with Premier Campbell we might have discussed that . 
I have very good relations with the premiers . 
Federal-provincial relations are very difficult and it is very rare that they want to return money to the federal government . 
Mr. Stephen Harper ( Leader of the Opposition , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not know what to make of that answer other than maybe the Prime Minister should be golfing full time rather than being Prime Minister if that is his attitude . 
There is a serious fiscal disequilibrium in the country between the federal government that has these massive tax revenues and provinces and municipalities that need gas taxes to do the essential jobs that are given to them . 
We have proposed , and many others have proposed , roughly 3¢ or more a litre of federal gas tax to go to the provinces . 
I ask the Prime Minister again , what share does he have in mind and when is he going to actually contact the provinces , take his job seriously and have a serious discussion on a motion -- 
The Speaker : 
The right hon. Prime Minister . 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am always smiling when the hon. Leader of the Opposition talks about the problem of leadership . 
I think he will be the sixth leader of the opposition before I leave . 
The wedding is being reorganized again and they will have a new name . 
This is a problem that is serious . 
We said we would discuss it with the provinces .  I know the provinces are not unanimous on it . 
We will discuss it . 
The Minister of Finance is meeting on Friday with the ministers of finance from the provinces . 
Probably some of the ministers of finance will talk to him about it . 
It is a process of consultation . 
A decision will come in due course and probably he will not be -- 
The Speaker : 
The hon. member for Edmonton Southwest . 
Technology Partnerships Canada 
Mr. James Rajotte ( Edmonton Southwest , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , corporate welfare is alive and well in the Liberal government . 
Fred Bennett , former director at Industry Canada , has publicly stated that officials in the department deliberately set up loan programs in such a way that money would likely never be repaid . 
Why are programs such as Technology Partnerships Canada designed in such a way to ensure that taxpayers ' money is never repaid ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I can tell the member that last fiscal year total receipts from companies in which investments had been made through TPC were almost $ 19 million . 
That is double the amount from the last fiscal year and repayments continue to accelerate . 
We negotiate terms which involve repayment of TPC investments . 
TPC is one of the ways in which we invest in innovation . 
That is obviously something with which the hon. member does not agree . 
We believe in innovation on this side of this House . 
Mr. James Rajotte ( Edmonton Southwest , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let us review these repayments . 
First of all , an $ 8 million loan to Western Star Trucks ; repayment , zero . 
An $ 84 million loan to Pratt and Whitney ; repayment , zero . 
An $ 85 million loan to Bombardier ; repayment , zero . 
The fact is , and the minister knows this , less than 2 % of TPC loans have been repaid since 1996 . 
Why is the government giving away taxpayer dollars with no intention whatsoever of recouping them ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member should know that these investments are often made in pre-competitive research and development for emerging sectors of the economy . 
It takes a while to get these products to market and for the companies to be in a position to repay . 
Let me quote from Mr. Bennett 's book , which he published a couple of years ago on this subject , called A Call to Account . 
He said : 
My belief is that the deals are now structured in such a way under the new TPC program .. the repayment terms are clear . 
TPC is now working very well . 
Taxation 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier -- Sainte-Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , by voting in favour of the Canadian Alliance 's motion , the government is supporting the next Liberal leader 's wish to provide a portion of the federal gasoline tax directly to the municipalities , without going through Quebec . 
By voting in favour of interference , does the Prime Minister realize that his government , encouraged by his successor , has just given the green light to even greater encroachment in Quebec 's jurisdiction ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I can read the motion : `` That , in the opinion of the House , the government should initiate immediate discussions with the provinces and territories to provide municipalities with a portion of the federal gas tax . '' 
I stress the word discussions . 
We are talking about discussions . 
I said earlier that some provinces are in favour , while others are not . 
These discussions will allow us to see if we can find a solution acceptable to the federal government , the provinces and the municipalities . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier -- Sainte-Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Quebec 's Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , a federalist , has already responded to this proposal by saying that the increasing federal interference is proof of the fiscal imbalance and the abuse of federal spending powers so Ottawa can dictate to the provinces and Quebec . 
Since the government has given the go-ahead to implement the plan of the new Liberal leader , a man who wants the federal government to deal directly with the municipalities , will the Prime Minister admit that his government is preparing to tell Quebec what to do within its own areas of jurisdiction ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the motion says that we will talk with the provinces . 
I am well aware that Quebec has legislation that says that the federal government cannot give money to a municipality without provincial government approval . 
Obviously , the aim of these discussions will be to see if we can find a solution to that problem . 
But , without discussions , we will never know . 
The municipalities want us to help them , and the provincial governments want a different formula . 
If we talk , we can find a solution . 
If we do not talk , we will not find a solution . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the problem is that the resolution on which the government voted yesterday is being interpreted by the real decision maker , who is not here .  He is elsewhere , and has announced his intention to bring together the municipalities and the provinces in order to discuss transfer of the tax . 
I am asking the Prime Minister if there is not a danger of his successor being even more centralist than he has been and putting heavy pressure on the provinces by sitting them down directly with the municipalities and holding out money as the incentive ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very surprised , happy even , to be told by the hon. member for Roberval that I am such a nice Prime Minister , one who is always in favour of the provinces , which my successor may not be . 
I thank him for that . 
It is a point of view I have not heard for ages . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister has a gift for interpreting things a little differently than intended . 
What I said was that we thought centralist tendencies had gone as far as they could go with him , and now we find that the other one is worse . 
That is what we are learning . 
I have this question for the Prime Minister . 
With the federal approach of sitting the municipalities down with the provinces to distribute the money , are we to expect that later on -- for example in connection with education -- they will be calling together the school boards and the provincial governments , while Ottawa puts more money on the table ? 
Is that how they are going to do things in future ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I see clearly that the member for Roberval is seeking my assistance in this matter . 
All I could do to help would be to suggest he sit down quietly and read the resolution calmly . 
He would then see that it is a matter of holding discussions with the provinces and the municipalities . 
There is nothing to worry about . 
The government and the Province of Quebec will be at the table for the discussions , as will the governments of the other provinces . 
Also , I am not about to go over to the Bloc Quebecois , no worry about that . 
I am capable of being a federalist prime minister with the flexibility he has already attributed to me . 
Foreign Affairs 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou -- Antigonish -- Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadians are being treated to the spectacle of two parallel governments and two competing prime ministers . 
To make matters worse -- 
Some hon. members : Oh , oh . 
The Speaker : 
Order . 
I know all hon. members are looking forward to the clarification the hon. member is offering in his question . 
We will want to hear the hon. member for Pictou -- Antigonish -- Guysborough who has the floor . 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
Mr. Speaker , we now have two different versions of what is factually correct about the Maher Arar case . 
The Solicitor General says that no information was passed to the Americans . 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs says that he believes Colin Powell 's version , that the Americans received information from Canadian authorities . 
Which is it ? 
On which minister 's report is the Prime Minister basing his decision not to have a public inquiry ? 
Hon. Wayne Easter ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I answered this question before a committee several times yesterday . 
Clearly , the RCMP is a very highly respected organization and has tremendous integrity . 
I have been assured and I have said that the RCMP was not involved in the decision made by the United States in this matter . 
I know that the member and the party opposite do not like to hear those facts , but those are the facts and we are standing by those facts . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou -- Antigonish -- Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Solicitor General would not know a fact if it bit him on the rump . 
The Solicitor General was quoted as saying that rogue elements in the RCMP passed along information to the Americans . 
Since then he has reversed himself , he has covered up , and now he claims the RCMP were not involved . 
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told our foreign minister that the RCMP did disclose information on Mr. Arar . 
The foreign affairs minister went so far as to state that `` Mr. Powell spoke truthfully to me '' . 
Again , my question is for the Prime Minister . 
Who does he believe and who should Canadians believe ?  The Solicitor General of Canada or the U.S. Secretary of State . 
Hon. Wayne Easter ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think I heard that question coming from the rump over there in the corner . 
This is a very serious matter . 
We recognize that . 
We have talked to the RCMP extensively . 
I have said to Canadians and to the foreign affairs committee that we do not talk about operational matters within the RCMP . 
I have outlined very clearly that the RCMP was not involved in the decision by United States authorities to arrest and deport Mr. Arar . 
Could I be more clearer ?  I could not . 
Taxation 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg -- Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , perhaps the minister of immigration would be better advised to be working on a biometric scan that could tell the difference between the two Liberal caucuses or the Alliance and the Conservatives . 
My question has to do with the way in which everyone in the House , with the exception of the Bloc , appears to have embraced -- 
Some hon. members : Oh , oh . 
The Speaker : 
Order . 
The hon. member for Winnipeg -- Transcona is an experienced parliamentarian . 
I am sure he realizes that these kinds of statements provoke disorder in the House , and to assist the Speaker he would want to get right on with his question , so we can have an answer . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie : 
Mr. Speaker , I was referring to the fact that everyone seems to embrace the proposal made months ago , if not years , by my leader , Jack Layton , with respect to the gas tax . 
Some hon. members : Oh , oh . 
The Speaker : 
Order . 
I know it is Wednesday and the owls have come home to roost . 
However , the hon. member for Winnipeg -- Transcona has the floor and we will want to hear his question . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is , which policy does the government intend to follow ? 
That advocated by the leader of the NDP or the member for LaSalle -- Émard who has made it contingent on provincial participation which is the way that the Liberals always avoid having anything they promise really happen . 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member should read the motion . 
We talk about a discussion with provincial governments and the municipalities before coming to a conclusion . 
Some provincial governments have already expressed the opinion that we should not proceed . 
However , we will discuss that with them . 
We will try to convince them and find a solution . 
We are not doctrinaire like the NDP . 
It is always doctrinaire and always in a corner . 
Citizenship and Immigration 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg -- Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we invite the Prime Minister into the corner . 
We might have a few elbows for him . 
My question has to do with what I referred to earlier allegorically , and that of course is the ID card . 
The minister of immigration persists in this idea , in spite of the fact that all parties seem now to be against it . 
Would the Prime Minister tell us if he will tell the minister of immigration to stop this dumb idea or have a scan done on him to see why it is that he cannot hear anything ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thought it was supposed to be a supplementary to the first question . 
That means that the member was happy with the answer I gave him . 
In regard to his question , there is a discussion taking place . 
Eventually , there will be a conclusion . 
The minister of immigration is discussing a possibility that some people think is good and others think is not good . 
We have not reached a decision . 
I guess that the leader of the NDP or the second leader of the NDP is not in agreement with the minister of immigration . 
Technology Partnerships Canada 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , over the summer CSL subsidiary Canadian Shipbuilding &amp ; Engineering Ltd. was given a $ 4.9 million grant from Technology Partnerships Canada . 
The new Liberal leader appears to have benefited directly from the TPC grant , so much so that the ethics counsellor was consulted before the grant was made . 
Given that there is a common clause in most government contracts that no member of Parliament should benefit from grants and contributions , can the Minister of Industry advise the House whether the CS&amp;E contract contains such a clause ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is well known that the entire business enterprise of the former finance minister was in a blind trust . 
It was operated entirely at arm 's length from the minister during the time he was in cabinet . 
He respected all of the ethical guidelines and more . 
That is typical of his conduct throughout the past 10 years . 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is a serious matter . 
It is serious enough that the Minister of Industry needs to address it in a better manner than he did . 
We already know that political pressure was applied from at least one member of Parliament to approve the grant . 
I am sure this must only be a coincidence , but on June 7 the Minister of Industry endorsed the new Liberal leader and 12 days later the Minister of Industry gave the Liberal leader 's company a $ 4.9 million grant . 
Will the Minister of Industry stand up today and table the TPC contract with CS&amp;E so that we can all see it ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member has sunk to a new low , a low which day by day does discredit to himself and his party . 
This investment was made after due diligence by officials acting in good faith by investing in Canadian research and development to advance innovation , create and maintain jobs , and attract investment in the country . 
We believe in investing in the future of our economy and not playing these little political games . 
Taxation 
Mr. Pierre Paquette ( Joliette , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if it truly wants to help the provinces , the federal government should change the equalization formula , as demanded by the coalition of provinces . 
Incidentally , all these provinces , even those with Liberal governments , agree that the current situation is unacceptable . 
Why is the government interfering in provincial jurisdictions instead of listening to the provinces , which are unanimously calling for changes to the equalization program ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the equalization program is one of our government 's most costly at more than $ 10 billion a year . 
It is not hard to reach a consensus among the provinces on asking the federal government for an increase in funding . 
It is simple , and I fully understand that they would prefer us to levy taxes so that they can spend the revenues . 
Mr. Pierre Paquette ( Joliette , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the real problem is that the federal government has the same tax fields as the provinces , but not the same responsibilities . 
Not only has this government never stopped encroaching , but can it deny that things will be worse with the future prime minister , who is already talking about negotiating not between two levels , but three ? 
Hon. Stéphane Dion ( President of the Queen 's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is always the same thing with the Bloc Quebecois . 
Recently , their great guru , Jacques Parizeau , said that the Canadian federation was the most decentralized in the world , but they are still going on about centralization . 
They have no evidence that it exists , but they continue to scare Quebeckers with the risks that centralization would entail . 
They are unable to provide any evidence to that effect . 
Canada remains one of the most decentralized federations , owing to the fact that Quebeckers and other Canadians have created a great federation with , among other things , an equalization program that provides the Government of Quebec with $ 5 billion a year . 
Technology Partnerships Canada 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Lansdowne Technologies is a subsidiary of Canadian Shipbuilding &amp ; Engineering which in turn is a subsidiary of the new Liberal leader 's shipping empire . 
According to its website , one of Lansdowne 's specialities is government procurement , fancy that . 
In fact , Public Works Canada has transacted over $ 12 million in business with Lansdowne . 
Is that not nice ? 
Can the Prime Minister explain why a CSL subsidiary receiving over $ 12 million in government business was not included in the new Liberal leader 's blind trust declaration ? 
Why the omission ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have always said and I repeat that when the former finance minister , the member for LaSalle -- Émard , became minister , he met with the then registrar general who became the ethics counsellor and put his assets in a blind trust like all of us had to do . 
This arrangement was made between himself and this government official . 
Every time there was a problem the ethics counsellor was consulted . 
I have not been informed of any conflict of interest except for the opposition 's habit of throwing dirt all the time . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am saying that the Prime Minister should be aware of this fact . 
This is a $ 12 million omission from the blind trust declaration . 
Will the Prime Minister take this issue seriously ? 
Lansdowne is engaged in government procurement . 
It is engaged in arranging contracts with government . 
My question again to the Prime Minister is : why is Lansdowne not included in the blind trust declaration of the former finance minister ? 
Why that $ 12 million omission ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , every time the opposition had problems like that it communicated with the ethics counsellor . 
Why does it not do that ? 
It just wants to raise it in the House of Commons in order to throw dirt as it likes to do . 
However , the people of Canada do not buy it . 
Business Development Bank of Canada 
Mr. Paul Crête ( Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today the Business Development Bank of Canada is making the news again , as we learn that the management of the bank has spent close to $ 1 million on two galas and one day of training . 
We will recall that the current head of this institution , Michel Vennat , is the same person that the Prime Minister appointed to cover up the Grand-Mère scandal . 
Will the Minister of Industry intervene with the bank and take drastic measures to put an end to this squandering of public funds ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the BDC is a Crown corporation operating at arm 's length from the government . 
It is operating in a business environment , and managers report to the board of directors . 
I expect that BDC officials will report to the board on the issue raised by the hon. member . 
Mr. Paul Crête ( Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , could the minister tell us why the bank suddenly becomes an independent organization when it comes to preventing the squandering of public funds , but the Prime Minister felt free to press and intervene directly with the bank 's president at the time to squelch the Auberge Grand-Mère issue ? 
Is that not a double standard ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Yes , Mr. Speaker , this is clearly an independent agency of the government , a Crown corporation . 
It has its own powers , and managers report to the board of directors . 
The member will have to ask the president and the board of directors for details . 
Health 
Mr. Rob Merrifield ( Yellowhead , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday Dr. Naylor said that the handling of SARS was a national embarrassment . 
That was what we said last spring . 
In his report it states : 
-- Health Canada personnel .. largely invisible [ that is on page 31 ] .. deficiencies in data acquisition and sharing [ that is on page 201 ] .. significant gaps and inconsistencies with respect to information on SARS [ that is on page 202 ] . 
Will the minister finally apologize for her government 's inadequacy in dealing with SARS ? 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Health , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very amused , if not impressed , by the selective reading by the hon. member for Yellowhead of Dr. Naylor 's report . 
Let me focus on what Dr. Naylor said . 
He said that all levels of government need to work together to renew our public health infrastructure . 
I have made a commitment to Canadians on behalf of the government that that is exactly what we will do . 
Mr. Rob Merrifield ( Yellowhead , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , 44 deaths is not light reading . 
I would like to quote from page 205 that says : 
In 2002 , Health Canada informed airport authorities that it would be transferring airport quarantine responsibilitiesto Canada Customs . 
These Customs staff were never trained for the job . 
This comes right out of his report . 
Why were those Customs staff never trained to do the job ? 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Health , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we had quarantine officers on the ground in airports such as Vancouver and Toronto . 
There is no question that we are working closely with the CCRA to ensure that people receive the training that is required . 
We have already indicated that we will increase the number of quarantine officers we have , not only at airports but at ports . 
Again , I think Dr. Naylor and his committee have made very sensible and responsible recommendations on which we as a government will be acting . 
Trade 
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( St. Catharines , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , January 1 , 2004 , represents an important milestone in the trade and economic relationship between Canada , the United States and Mexico . 
This date marks the 10th anniversary of the North American Free Trade Agreement , making North America the largest free trade area , with about one-third of the world 's GDP . 
Could the Minister for International Trade advise the House of what is being done to ensure that the North American region remains the most dynamic in the world ? 
Hon. Pierre Pettigrew ( Minister for International Trade , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday in Montreal I had a very interesting and productive meeting with my colleagues , Ambassador Zoellick of the United States and Secretary Canales of Mexico . 
We agreed on a number of practical steps to enhance trade and investment in North America that will increase the transparency and efficiency of NAFTA 's chapter 11 , establish a North American steel trade committee that will promote more openness and integration in the North American steel market and reduce exports related transaction costs in the NAFTA region . 
It is a work in progress , and we will continue . 
Foreign Affairs 
Right Hon. Joe Clark ( Calgary Centre , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
Did Secretary of State Colin Powell tell the Minister of Foreign Affairs that Canadian sources gave the United States information that led to the deportation to Syria of Mr. Arar ? 
While he is at it , would he tell us whether Mr. Powell said that Canadian source was the RCMP ? 
Hon. Bill Graham ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I had a conversation with Secretary Powell and I raised this matter . 
I protested strongly to the United States that when Canadians are in the United States they should be treated as Canadians and returned to Canada . 
In the course of that discussion , he said to me that advice from his officials was that this was inappropriate in terms of international law by the United States and it was covered by arrangements . 
That was his advice to me .  This is what he was told by his officials . 
Secretary Powell and I always have the frankness of accords . 
He knows very strongly that Canada is of the position that when Canadians are in the United States they should be treated as Canadians and returned to this country , and the Solicitor General and I work on that premise . 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland -- Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with all due respect to the Minister of Foreign Affairs , that was not the question . 
The question was , did Colin Powell indicate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs , in a discussion with him , that information that came from Canadian sources resulted in Mr. Arar 's incarceration for a year in Syria ? 
Hon. Bill Graham ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in my conversation with Secretary Powell , he said that the American authorities had acted within their jurisdiction to take the steps they did based on information which they had received which justified the steps that they took . 
That is the information which he told me . 
That is what he gave me and of course that is what he was operating under . 
Secretary Powell was perfectly frank with me . 
He operates on the basis of advice from officials like every other secretary of state in the world . 
Infrastructure 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , after nine years of creating potholes on the road to Damascus , the new Liberal leader says he now wants to pave it . 
As finance minister , he hiked the gas tax but did not give a penny to cities . 
Last September he opposed 10 year targets , but now he says he does not . 
My leader , Jack Layton , has been clear on the stance of supporting cities . 
Some hon. members : Oh , oh . 
The Speaker : 
Order , please . 
We have been through this once already . 
The hon. member for Windsor West has the floor . 
We will want to hear his question . 
Mr. Brian Masse : 
They may be a fans of the Who . 
I am a fan of the Guess Who . 
My question is for the sitting finance minister . 
Is the position of the Liberal government that sharing the gas tax means Canada does not need a permanent infrastructure program ? 
Is that the real agenda ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
You know , Mr. Speaker , if this Layton fellow ever shows up in here , he has already missed the one byelection in his province in which he could have offered himself , perhaps we will need biometrics to identify him at the door when he gets here . 
I would suggest the hon. member look at the record of the government that established the first infrastructure program in 1993 , and year after year have renewed it in order to contribute to the building of strategic and municipal infrastructure across this country . 
That will continue . 
Government Assistance 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister has not even placed a phone call to Nova Scotians 10 days after hurricane Juan ripped through our province . 
He cannot be unaware that many desperate citizens have been forced to exhaust their limited resources to replace food lost in the power outage and to repair homes exposed to the elements . 
I ask the Prime Minister this .  Will the federal government provide immediate financial assistance to Nova Scotians on CPP disability or other vulnerable pensioners to ensure they are able to purchase the basic necessities of daily life ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien ( Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am supposed to meet with the Premier of Nova Scotia tomorrow morning . 
She cannot say I do not pay attention to Nova Scotia . 
That day the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans rushed to Nova Scotia . 
They were the first to arrive . 
We had more than 1,000 soldiers doing their job . 
The work of the federal government was well done . 
Of course , as I was departing for the west at that time , I could not be there . 
We have a big country . 
When we are in Vancouver it is difficult to have breakfast there and then lunch in Halifax . 
Health 
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the environment commissioner 's report says that the government is moving too slow on evaluating older pesticides causing health and environmental problems . 
It says that the process for evaluating new pesticides is flawed and deadlines are not being met to get these products on the market . 
The commissioner identified 406 pesticides which must be evaluated . 
In 15 years only 6 have been evaluated . 
What is taking so long ? 
What is the problem ? 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Health , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I indicated yesterday , we have re-evaluated some 61 active ingredients . 
Of these , some have been phased out by their manufacturer . 
Others have been withdrawn from the market or are currently in the process of being phased out . 
I want to reassure all Canadians that we take the regulation of pesticides very seriously . 
In fact the commissioner acknowledges that progress has been made . 
Do we need to make additional progress ? 
Yes . 
We now have new legislation . 
Regulations will promulgated in the spring of 2004 , and with additional resources we will do an even better job in protecting health . 
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the commissioner says that only 6 out of 406 have been evaluated , so denying the problem does not mean there just is not one . 
The government has been warned four times that its pesticide evaluation process is broken . 
It has done nothing . 
I quote the commissioner who says , `` For an issue that touches health , this is unacceptable .. Canadians have a right to expect better answers '' . 
When will the government speed up the evaluation process of these pesticides ? 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Health , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we are fully aware of the challenges , both around re-evaluation of existing pesticides and the evaluation of new pesticides to be introduced into the market . 
My colleague the Minister of Agriculture and I are putting additional resources into the evaluation and re-evaluation of pesticides .  We have new legislation . 
The new legislation will be in full force and effect in the spring of 2004 . 
I can reassure Canadians that we take our obligations in relation to their health and safety very seriously . 
Foreign Affairs 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois-Rivières , BQ ) : 
It is becoming increasingly clear from the replies he has given in the Arar case that the Solicitor General does not take this House seriously . 
What we are asking of the Solicitor General is not whether the Royal Canadian Mounted Police took part in the decision by the Americans to deport M. Arar to Syria . 
The real question is very simple : did the RCMP send information on Maher Arar , a Canadian citizen , to the American authorities -- yes or no ? 
Hon. Wayne Easter ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I reject entirely the premise of the hon. member . 
We take this issue very seriously and we always have . 
As a matter of law and practice , and the hon. member should know this , the RCMP does not discuss operational matters in public , nor should a Solicitor General and I do not intend to do that . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois-Rivières , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are playing a very odd game . 
The government is using the RCMP for obscure purposes and the RCMP is agreeing to play along . 
Neither the government nor the future prime minister want to answer our questions . 
That is an example of the democratic deficit . 
I ask the Solicitor General once again if information concerning Maher Arar was sent to the Americans by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police . 
Hon. Wayne Easter ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me expand a little further on the reason why neither I nor the RCMP talk about operational matters . 
We do it to protect the privacy of individuals involved and to protect the integrity of investigations that are ongoing . 
That is why it is necessary to do it . 
The fact of the matter is that in this country we operate on the principle of innocence . 
Health 
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich -- Gulf Islands , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development had some very harsh words for the health minister in her latest report . 
The commissioner 's report says that Health Canada is not properly managing pesticides and cannot determine what the health risks of certain pesticides are . 
The sole purpose of the Pest Management Regulatory Agency is to manage pesticides and determine what in fact their health risks are . 
The minister will tell us , `` Well , maybe next year , 2004 , I will have some more resources or some new regulations '' . 
This government has been in power for 10 years . 
Why is it not doing its job now ? 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Health , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I have made plain , we are doing our job . 
In response to earlier Auditor General 's reports , we have acted . 
We have new legislation , modern legislation . 
The regulations will be in full force and effect under that legislation in the spring of 2004 . 
However let me reassure all Canadians that those pesticides which are presently on the market are rigorously assessed in relation to health risk and environmental risk and there should be no misunderstanding about that important point . 
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich -- Gulf Islands , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is not good enough . 
This minister always wants to tell us , `` in a timely fashion , maybe next year , we'll get to it later '' . 
Health Canada continues to renew temporary registrations for pesticides without knowing what the risks are . 
Sixty per cent of pesticides are rushed into the market without proper testing . 
How can this possibly be good for Canadians ? 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Health , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member discusses temporary registration . 
All registration decisions , whether temporary or full , are based on rigorous scientific evaluation of the health and environmental risks posed by pesticides . 
Let me reassure everyone that at no time is a temporary registration granted without a clear indication that the risks are acceptable . 
International Aid 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , China has recently announced that it would send three astronauts into space . 
If this country can spend that kind of money , it definitely does not need our aid money . 
I have called before and I am calling again . 
Will this government stop its aid flow immediately to China and redirect it to needy areas such as Africa ? 
Hon. Susan Whelan ( Minister for International Cooperation , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have said it before in this House , and the hon. member is well aware , that CIDA 's primary mandate is to reduce poverty through sustainable development . 
China has over 240 million people who are classified as being the world 's poorest . 
Our programming in China involves projects that help reduce poverty , that ensure sustainable development and that improve human rights . 
It is very important that we deal with 20 % of all the world 's poor people , and the hon. member should be well aware of that fact . 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadians are generous but they are not stupid . 
India has officially called on us to halt our aid to it .  The reason for this is because it can take care of its own problems . 
Why does this minister continue an aid policy that targets countries that no longer need our help , while ignoring the needy regions of Africa and Latin America ? 
Hon. Susan Whelan ( Minister for International Cooperation , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is very pleased to hear how far India has come in terms of its own development . 
The announcement by the government of India highlights that its ability to take a leadership role in its own development is very important . 
We will continue to work toward reducing poverty for sustainable development around the globe to ensure that all countries , including Canada , will see the benefits of those results . 
The hon. member should be well aware of that . 
Cloning 
Mr. Réal Ménard ( Hochelaga -- Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Quebec health and social services minister Philippe Couillard has taken a stand against Bill C-13 , the cloning bill , arguing that this bill clearly encroached on Quebec 's jurisdictions . 
Will the Minister of Health listen to her counterpart in Quebec and withdraw from an area that does not concern her by dividing her bill in two , to ensure that the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces are respected ? 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Health , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member and I have discussed this matter for some time and he knows that my answer to this question is no . 
My Quebec counterpart and I have had very fruitful discussions on this issue . 
Mr. Couillard is well aware that there are equivalency provisions in the legislation , except for the criminal prohibitions , that would permit the province of Quebec to enact an equivalent regime as it relates to the challenge of infertility . 
I look forward to both my officials and myself being able to carry on these discussions with the Quebec government in the weeks ahead . 
Veterans Affairs 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , according to The Sports Network , the Toronto Maple Leafs have spent more money on defence than the government . 
The finance minister has denied Veterans Affairs the funds needed to extend the VIP to those widows whose husbands died before May 12 . 
As I said , May 12 is the blackest day in the history of this country . 
Why will the Minister of Finance not do the right thing and give the Veterans Affairs minister the money that is needed to treat all war widows equally ? 
Hon. Rey Pagtakhan ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Science , Research and Development ) , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , perhaps I should remind the hon. member that Veterans Affairs Canada delivers many programs for veterans , their families and surviving spouses . 
We spent $ 1.6 billion on pensions and allowances for veterans and their families , one-third of which went to surviving spouses . 
We spent $ 650 million on health care benefits , of which $ 185 million went to the VIP . 
We will continue to do more . 
The Environment 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie -- Bathurst , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sure that the government is aware by now of the demonstration that took place in Belledune last Sunday . 
Two thousand people protested against the construction of an incinerator in Belledune without any independent environmental impact study . 
My question is for the Minister of Transport . 
People are wondering if the land on which Bennett Environmental is building the incinerator in Belledune harbour is owned by the federal government or is otherwise connected with the government . 
Could the Minister of Transport tell us whether the land is owned by the federal government or not ? 
Hon. David Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would think this is really an Order Paper question . 
I will endeavour to get an answer for the hon. member . 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton -- Melville , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , real criminals are still on the loose because of cutbacks in DNA analyses at RCMP labs and yet at the same time the federal government continues to spend millions registering the guns of law-abiding citizens . 
We fully expect the minister to stand and continue his song and dance about how wonderful the registry is but this is the question : Will the minister please explain why registering firearms is a higher priority than uncovering DNA evidence that would put real criminals behind bars ? 
Hon. Wayne Easter ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it has been a little while since we heard the song and dance from that member opposite on the same old issue on which he continues to have a real problem getting his facts straight . 
If he would look at yesterday 's Hansard he would see , in response to a question from the member for Crowfoot , where I talked about the forensic labs and said that we were increasing FTEs in Regina and that we were doing a better job of turnaround times . 
Those are the facts . 
We are doing a good job on the forensic labs as well as on gun control . 
ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
Government Response to Petitions 
Mr. Rodger Cuzner ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36(8) I have the honour to table , in both official languages , the government 's response to 13 petitions . 
Committees of the House 
Health 
Ms. Bonnie Brown ( Oakville , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the sixth report of the Standing Committee on Health . 
Pursuant to its order of reference dated Thursday , November 28 , 2002 , your committee has considered Bill C-260 , an act to amend the Hazardous Products Act with regard to fire safe cigarettes , and agreed on Tuesday , October 7 , 2003 , to report it to you with amendments . 
Procedure and House Affairs 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present the 46th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding its order of reference of Tuesday , October 7 , 2003 , in relation to Bill C-49 , an act respecting the effective date of the representation order of 2003 . 
The committee has considered Bill C-49 and reports the bill with an amendment . 
I would like to thank the committee and , before it , the subcommittee , which worked on the important matter of reorganizing our electoral boundaries following the last census . 
Public Accounts 
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the 22nd report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts . 
In accordance with its order of reference of Tuesday , September 23 , 2003 , the committee has considered Vote 20a -- Auditor General under finance in the Supplementary Estimates (A) for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 2004 , and reports the same . 
Criminal Code 
Mrs. Carol Skelton ( Saskatoon -- Rosetown -- Biggar , Canadian Alliance ) 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-454 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( section 606 ) . 
She said : Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to reintroduce my private member 's bill which would amend certain provisions of section 606 of the Criminal Code relating to plea bargaining . 
It would ensure that when a plea bargain is used for a serious crime the Attorney General of Canada must approve it in writing . 
My bill sends a clear message to Canadians that there will be a new level of accountability in our justice system . 
It also sends a message to the legal community that Canadians , while supportive of plea bargains , believe they are all too common and often favour the criminal . 
I am confident all members will support it when given the opportunity . 
( Motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
Petitions 
Marriage 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton -- Melville , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have three petitions containing thousands of names and they are in regard to the traditional definition of marriage . 
A recent court decision has redefined marriage contrary to the wishes of Parliament and now the government wants Parliament to vote on new legislation but only after it has been approved by the Supreme Court . 
This is a dangerous precedent for democracy in Canada . 
Elected members of Parliament should decide the marriage issue not appointed judges . 
They therefore ask Parliament to immediately hold a renewed debate on the definition of marriage and to reaffirm , as it did in 1999 , its commitment to take all necessary steps to preserve marriage as a union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
I cannot go through all of this but there are people from throughout Saskatchewan . 
Hundreds of different towns are represented here . 
I will simply submit these without going through a list of all the different places the petitioners come from but there are thousands of names . 
Mr. Gurbax Malhi ( Bramalea -- Gore -- Malton -- Springdale , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I as well will state that the undersigned citizens to this petition I have draw the attention of the House to the following : that marriage is the best foundation for families and the raising of children and that the definition of the institution of marriage as being between a man and a woman is being challenged . 
Marriage is the lifelong union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
Foreign Affairs 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to table petitions duly certified from close to 1,000 Canadians calling upon Parliament to ensure that Canada not participate in a star wars missile defence program , condemning George Bush 's destabilizing plans , and calling upon us to work with our partners in peace for more arms control and peacefully bring an end to the production and sale of weapons of mass destruction and any material used to build them . 
Marriage 
Mr. Joseph Volpe ( Eglinton -- Lawrence , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I also have a series of petitions duly certified according to the appropriate standing order . 
There are some 50,000 drawn from my riding and other areas in and around the great metropolis of Toronto and they express the concerns of many of our citizens regarding marriage . 
I will read their petition : `` Whereas marriage is the best foundation for families and the raising of children -- 
The Speaker : 
Order . 
I appreciate the hon. member 's concern , but I am sure he knows the rule that reading of petitions is not permitted . 
He will want to give a succinct summary of the petition . 
Mr. Joseph Volpe : 
Mr. Speaker , I thought you might grant me a little more indulgence inasmuch as I have 50,000 . 
I can present them either singly or in a batch , but I thank you for drawing this to my attention . 
The petitioners are concerned about the definition of marriage and pray that this Parliament will pass legislation to recognize the institution of marriage in federal law as being the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
I thank you for your attention , Mr. Speaker . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta -- South Richmond , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have three petitions to present today . 
The first petition has to do with the definition of marriage . 
The petitioners ask that Parliament confirm the traditional definition of marriage and provide constitutional protection for same . 
Religious Freedom 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta -- South Richmond , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition I have to present today concerns the addition of sexual orientation as a protected category under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
The petitioners express concern that religious freedom may be impacted by this inclusion and call on Parliament to protect the right of all Canadians to their religious beliefs . 
Search and Rescue 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta -- South Richmond , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the third petition I have , over 1,000 petitioners have signed on . 
They are expressing concern about the government 's handling , so to speak , of the purchase of a replacement hovercraft for Sea Island in Richmond . 
They note that the 20-year-old hovercraft that is being touted and is probably going to be purchased as a replacement hovercraft is certainly unsuitable for the task at hand . 
They call on Parliament to ensure that when a replacement hovercraft is made available , and they want that to happen soon , it is one that is going to be capable of doing the job . 
Rural Route Mail Couriers 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I too am pleased to table a petition from people mainly in the riding of Longueuil .  The petitioners are asking Parliament to repeal subsection 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act so that rural route mail couriers can benefit from decent conditions . 
Marriage 
Mr. Janko Peric ( Cambridge , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , it is my privilege to present to the House a petition dealing with marriage and signed by some 130 constituents from my riding of Cambridge . 
The petitioners wish to draw to the attention of the House the fact that the institution of marriage has always been defined as the union of one man and one woman and was upheld as such by votes in this House . 
The petitioners pray and request that the Parliament of Canada respect and uphold the current understanding of marriage as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
Health 
Miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I know you and I and Polonius would agree , would we not , that brevity is the soul of wit . 
I have 22,803 petitions here from people from all across the country . 
They are talking about preventatively using vitamins and supplements for health . 
I know we all understand that and appreciate it , but they are saying that they not only should be just as recorded by a pharmacist , as quoted in subsection 118.2(2)(n) of the Income Tax Act , but also that these vitamins and supplements should be GST exempt . 
There are thousands here . 
There are thousands more coming . 
I will be delighted to present them when they arrive . 
Stem Cell Research 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg -- Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have three different petitions to present today . 
The first one calls upon Parliament to focus its legislative support on adult stem cell research to find the cures and therapies necessary to treat illness and diseases of suffering Canadians . 
Child Pornography 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg -- Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the second submission is a group of petitions . 
I will present them all at once .  The petitions call upon Parliament to protect our children by taking all necessary steps to ensure that all materials which promote or glorify pedophilia or sado-masochistic activities involving children are outlawed . 
Bill C-250 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg -- Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the third petition refers to Bill C-250 and it calls on Parliament to use all possible legislative and administrative measures to preserve and protect the criminal code . 
Agriculture 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I rise to present a petition from citizens of Peterborough County and surrounding areas who have been hard hit by the BSE crisis . 
The petitioners point out that the Canadian beef cattle , dairy , goat and sheep industries are in a state of crisis and that in fact this is affecting the entire rural area . 
The aid package to the industry is inadequate in that it does not deal with the disastrously low prices experienced and the imminent collapse of various sectors of the rural economy . 
The petitioners call upon Parliament to open the American border to Canadian cattle now and as soon as possible develop a long term solution and economic relief that is fair and reflects the importance of these industries in Canada . 
Child Care 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I have a second petition from a large number of members of the Catholic Women 's League . 
The petitioners point out that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that childhood is entitled to special care and assistance . 
The members of the National Council of the Catholic Women 's League of Canada passed a resolution in support of a national strategy on child care , their resolution 89.4 . 
They know that the Government of Canada has offered to increase finances toward a national day care strategy but they suggest that the implementation of improved child care over the next five years has met with various obstacles , and so they request Parliament to give priority to accessible , quality child care for all children . 
Bill C-250 
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris -- Moose Mountain , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Madam Speaker , I have two petitions . 
Like Canadians from coast to coast to coast , these people are petitioning the government . 
In the first one , the petitioners do not want the passing of Bill C-250 because of their fear of infringement of their own private rights . 
Marriage 
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris -- Moose Mountain , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Madam Speaker , the second petition is another huge one in which the petitioners want the government to make sure that it continues to treat marriage as a union of one man and one woman , exclusive of all others . 
Religious Freedom 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I have two petitions . 
The first has to do with the hate law . 
The petitioners want to draw to the attention of the House that we are all appalled by hate motivated attacks and believe promoting hatred toward a person or group is wrong . 
The petitioners pray upon Parliament to take all necessary measures to protect the rights of Canadians to freely share their religious and moral beliefs without fear of prosecution . 
Stem Cell Research 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , the second petition has to do with stem cell research . 
The petitioners draw to the attention of the House the fact that Canadians support ethical stem cell research , which has widely shown encouraging potential to provide cures and therapies for Canadians . 
The petitioners therefore call upon Parliament to focus its legislative support on non-embryonic stem cell research to find the cures and therapies necessary to treat the illnesses and diseases of Canadians . 
Marriage 
Mr. James Lunney ( Nanaimo -- Alberni , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Madam Speaker , I have three petitions . 
The first is on the subject of marriage . 
There are approximately 150 signatures from Nanaimo , Parksville , Qualicum and Lantzville , all in my riding . 
The petitioners are calling upon the House to recognize that marriage is the traditional foundation for families and for the raising of children . 
They are disturbed by recent decisions taken in the House and they call upon Parliament to honour the commitment of June 1999 calling for marriage to continue to be recognized as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
Genetically Modified Organisms 
Mr. James Lunney ( Nanaimo -- Alberni , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Madam Speaker , the second petition is on the subject of genetically modified foods . 
Again , this petition originates in my own riding in the communities of Parksville , Qualicum , Port Alberni , Nanoose , Bowser and even in Victoria . 
The petitioners are calling on Parliament to recognize that seeds and living organisms are part of our collective biological heritage . 
They object to commercialization and patenting of life forms . 
They predict devastating consequences for farmers and have concerns about production costs increasing and seed varieties and production techniques being limited . 
They are concerned about a very real threat to the rural way of life . 
The petitioners are calling on Parliament not to promote policies that heighten poverty or threaten the environment and increase hunger throughout the world . 
Health 
Mr. James Lunney ( Nanaimo -- Alberni , Canadian Alliance ) : 
The final one , Madam Speaker , is on Bill C-420 , natural health products .  There are approximately 350 signatures here . 
They come from my own riding , from the communities of Nanaimo and Parksville , and also from Alberta , Ontario and other communities across the country . 
The petitioners are calling upon Parliament to recognize that Canadians deserve freedom of choice in natural health products . 
They object to the restrictions that Health Canada is currently placing on natural health products by arbitrarily classing them as drugs as soon as a health claim is made . 
The petitioners are calling upon Parliament to recognize the weight of modern scientific evidence which confirms the mitigation and prevention of disease , many diseases and disorders , through the judicious use of natural health products and therefore ask that Parliament support Bill C-420 and implement changes that will enhance the availability of natural health products for all Canadians . 
Marriage 
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo -- Cowichan , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Madam Speaker , I have three petitions from both my riding of Nanaimo -- Cowichan and Ontario . 
The petitioners are calling on the government that in matters of important social policy , such as the definition of marriage , that this not be settled by an unelected judiciary but indeed by Parliament and are asking that Parliament reaffirm the traditional definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
Ms. Marlene Catterall ( Ottawa West -- Nepean , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I am pleased to present four petitions representing approximately 1,500 signatures from constituents and others calling upon Parliament to take all necessary steps within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to preserve the definition of marriage in Canada as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
Assisted Suicide 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Madam Speaker , I have several petitions here today .  These petitions are all duly signed off by the Clerk . 
One of them has to do with concerns that we maintain the sanctity of life , and the petitioners are urging Parliament to prohibit assisted suicide or euthanasia . 
Marriage 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Madam Speaker , I have two more petitions on the definition of marriage . 
The petitioners , with a slight variation in the type of petition , ask Parliament to recognize the institution of marriage in federal law as being the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
Religious Freedom 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Canadian Alliance ) : 
The last two petitions , Madam Speaker , have to do with the changes to sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code . 
The petitioners are concerned about their freedom to express and to share their religious beliefs without fear of prosecution and they ask Parliament not to change or add individuals or groups to sections 318 and 319 of the code . 
Questions on the Order Paper 
Mr. Rodger Cuzner ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I ask that all questions be allowed to stand . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : Is that agreed ? 
Some hon. members : Agreed . 
Motions for Papers 
Mr. Rodger Cuzner ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I ask that all Notices of Motions for the Production of Papers be allowed to stand . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : Is that agreed ? 
Some hon. members : Agreed . 
Government Orders 
Income Tax Act 
The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-48 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act ( natural resources ) , as reported ( without amendment ) from the committee . 
Hon. Ralph Goodale ( for the Minister of Finance ) 
moved that the bill be concurred in . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
Some hon. members : Agreed . 
Some hon. members : No . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : All those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
Some hon. members : Yea . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : All those opposed will please say nay . 
Some hon. members : Nay . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : In my opinion the yeas have it . 
And more than five members having risen : 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : Call in the members . 
The division on the motion stands deferred . 
Criminal Code 
The House resumed from September 29 , 2003 consideration of the motion that Bill C-46 , An Act to amend the Criminal Code ( capital markets fraud and evidence-gathering ) , be read the second time and referred to a committee . 
Mr. Paul Crête ( Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak today on Bill C-46 . 
The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of the bill in principle , but reserves its decision on the division at third reading stage until we see how the government reacts to our amendments . 
I would remind members that , as early as the fall of 2002 , the Bloc Quebecois urged the federal government to tighten the provisions of the Criminal Code so that the authorities would have better tools at their disposal to fight corporate fraud . 
The Bloc is therefore delighted that the government has given in to our pressures and has taken our opinions into account and retained some of our suggestions . 
We do , however , find it unfortunate that not all of our suggestions were accepted . 
For this reason , we advise you that , barring major amendments at third reading , we could decide to vote against it , even if we do agree with the principle at this second reading stage . 
These major reservations , however , relate to an aspect of the bill that we shall be trying to amend at the committee stage . 
We find it difficult to understand that this bill could provide that a federal attorney also has jurisdiction to prosecute Criminal Code offences concerning capital market fraud . 
This is especially worrisome to us since the federal government has publicly announced its intention of establishing a Canadian securities regulator . 
Having a Canadian Securities Commission was one of the obsessions of the former finance minister , soon to be the prime minister of Canada . 
And this would be done despite the fact that jurisdiction over this area is clearly indicated , despite the fact that the securities commissions in each province have made their choice clear . 
The former finance minister , the member for LaSalle -- Émard , seemed intent on getting his way on this . 
We are concerned about what Bill C-46 will turn out like if it is not amended in order to ensure clear respect of Quebec 's jurisdiction . 
For us , regulation of securities clearly falls under the jurisdiction of the Government of Quebec . 
We therefore disagree with the federal government 's intentions in this regard and want to be sure that no encroachments of jurisdiction will result . 
But , I want to talk in general terms about this legislation . 
This enactment amends the Criminal Code by creating a new offence of prohibited insider trading and creating a new offence to prohibit threatening or retaliating against employees for disclosing unlawful conduct . 
The enactment increases the maximum penalties and codifies aggravating and non-mitigating sentencing factors for fraud and certain related offences . 
In other words , the allowable sentences are being increased so as to deter people from committing this kind of offence . 
Furthermore , in keeping with the Criminal Code , the enactment provides for concurrent jurisdiction for the Attorney General of Canada to prosecute those offences , taking into consideration the reservations I mentioned earlier . 
In addition , the enactment also creates a new procedural mechanism by which persons will be required to produce documents , data or information in specific circumstances , to make it easier to build a solid case , without getting lost in a legal labyrinth when information is quickly needed to serve as evidence , and to ensure that any necessary changes can be made as soon as possible . 
Clearly , this bill follows on the heels of recent corporate scandals in the United States . 
We only need mention Enron . 
These scandals have made us aware of how fragile our financial system is and how much we rely on it . 
During the 1930s , before the crash , many of our parents and grandparents grew up believing that the stock market was undoubtedly a bit corrupt . 
After the crash , this sector had to rebuild a more honest , proper and appropriate image or reality . 
But recent scandals have tarnished the reputation of the financial sector , which desperately needs an unassailable , solid image . 
Investments take a beating when we can no longer trust the institutions charged with ensuring the transparency of financial transactions . 
The result is fewer transactions and disinterest on the part of investors . 
We must remedy such situations . 
Although at first we thought that only large investors were affected by a stock market crisis , that is not the case . 
As I was saying , the biggest players on the stock markets are the pension funds . 
As a result , if a pension fund suffers large losses , it is the small investors who can lose their life savings and see their retirement projects go up in smoke . 
That is why it was time for the federal government to intervene in this matter . 
The Bloc Quebecois has been speaking out on this subject for over a year . 
It is a question of ensuring that , at the end of the day , the people who have invested in the pension funds and who do not necessarily have day to day control over what happens to them , the people who trust the companies who administer the funds , will not have the surprise of finding themselves , at retirement , with assets that are not what they might have expected . 
This situation has been begging for a solution . 
For example , in 1998 , the Canadian trusteed pension funds held assets of more than $ 500 billion . 
Of that $ 500 billion held in pension fund assets , about $ 115 billion was invested in Canadian stocks and some $ 57 billion in foreign stocks . 
Four million Quebec and Canadian workers contribute to these funds . 
Only the financial assets of the chartered banks exceed the capital held by the pension funds . 
That illustrates the importance of this market , the importance of assuring these small investors , those who invest trustingly , through their pension funds , that their money is well invested . 
In addition , analysts have recently observed that trusteed pension funds tend to favour investment in stocks rather than in fixed interest securities . 
It is all the more important to ensure the validity and security of the system . 
In light of the previously mentioned figures , it is clear that a financial crisis would have a direct impact on the retirement incomes of millions of households and it is precisely those households that we have to protect . 
Fortunately , to date , Canadian markets have been relatively spared from professional misconduct , except for the cases involving CINAR and Nortel . 
In the CINAR case , the Bloc Quebecois condemned it in this House and revealed that there indeed had been major fraud within this company . 
Today , the company has started up again with new directors , but we do not know the full story , because the federal government signed an agreement through Revenue Canada to put out the fire . 
It was clear in this situation that interests close to the Liberal government were called into question , as were some people who were friends of the current regime . 
A way was found to prevent them from getting the sentences they deserve and that should have been handed down in these cases . 
Nonetheless , the CINAR and Nortel crises , and everything that happened in the United States , should encourage us to ensure that our legislation is well drafted and stronger , in order to discourage cheats who might want to abuse the system . 
However , the Bloc Quebecois feels that despite the fact that our securities regulation systems are , in the opinion of many experts , much more comprehensive than what existed in the United States before the financial crisis , it is nonetheless important to send a clear message to corporate directors that financial misconduct constitutes a serious crime that is not acceptable in our society . 
Let us learn from what happened in the United States . 
The messages were not clear enough .  People had a field day and thought they could do all kinds of things like artificially inflating companies , and conducting all kinds of financial transactions that eluded pension fund administrators . 
By the time a scandal breaks , it is too late for people who invested in these companies in good faith , thinking these were rather sound investments . 
We are not talking about investments in high risk areas . 
That is not how it was presented to the people who invested in good faith . 
In the United States , a really fraudulent system was set up . 
Here , in Quebec and Canada , this did not happen because we were better protected to begin with ; still , there are lessons to be learned , to ensure that in the future the system will be much more efficective than it is right now . 
That is why , in the fall of 2002 , the Bloc Quebecois called for major changes to be made to the Canadian Criminal Code in order to provide the appropriate authorities with better tools to fight crimes of a financial nature . 
What are these changes the Bloc Quebecois is calling for ? 
In a nutshell , since the fall of last year , we have proposed adding a section to the Criminal Code that would make insider trading a criminal offence in order to send a clear message to company directors that the use of confidential information obtained in the performance of their duties for the purpose of making profits or avoiding losses would not be tolerated . 
The idea is to avoid situations where , having heard that a transaction is about to take place , a person lines her own pockets during the time when no one else , or almost no one else , is aware of the transaction . 
Perhaps we thought for a long time that it was enough to rely on the good faith of people . 
We are realizing that we need measures , actions and stiff penalties to prevent insider trading . 
Such offences are one of the most tragic ways that investors ' confidence in the system can be shaken . 
These offenders figure , `` Others in the company , such as executive officers , stand to profit , while I , by the time news of the transaction reaches me , will not have the chance to buy and sell shares the usual way , since the game will be almost over and what could be gained will already have been gained because others have beat me to it , using information before they should have to pocket piles of money '' . 
This way , they make profits or avoid losses at the expense of other investors who do not have access to the same information . 
This sums up my point . 
We wanted this provision to be added after section 382 of the Criminal Code . 
It would have created an offence of insider trading , which would have carried a maximum sentence of ten years ' imprisonment so that people would be well aware of the consequences they could face before they decided to engage in such a behaviour . 
Then , should they be found guilty of such an offence , they would have to pay dearly . 
We see that the government accepted our suggestion and included a new offence of insider trading in the bill . 
We are pleased about that . 
The Bloc Quebecois also proposed that a new offence be created for securities fraud . 
This offence , which would be patterned on the measures adopted in the United States and which would also carry a ten-year prison term , would prohibit fraud when selling or buying securities . 
The Bloc also proposed two amendments to section 397 of the Criminal Code . 
This section clearly stipulates that fraud is committed by someone who : 
(a) destroys , mutilates , alters , falsifies or makes a false entry in , or  (b) omits a material particular from , or alters a material particular in , 
a book , paper , writing , valuable security or document . 
These provisions could have applied to falsified financial statements . 
It was noticed when gathering evidence , particularly in the American cases , that documents had disappeared and that the tools needed to punish those who had made these documents disappear were not available since no punishment was provided for in the Criminal Code . 
Furthermore , subsection 2 makes it a specific offence if documents are falsified with the intent to defraud creditors . 
This makes it even more relevant . 
In both cases , the sentence is five years . 
We , in the Bloc Quebecois , believe that this kind of sentence is not harsh enough to have a deterrent effect . 
Consequently , we propose that the maximum sentence be increased to ten years so that the message is clearer .  People must understand that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated and that those who are caught will have to pay a very high price . 
Finally , we suggest that a third paragraph be added to section 397 . 
This paragraph would deal with falsification of documents with intent to defraud stockholders . 
We think that stockholders , whose investments are not secured , unlike most creditors , constitute a category that is more vulnerable because they have no way of recovering their investment . 
Consequently , we cannot see why there is a specific offence of fraud that creditors might be the victims of , and there is no similar offence concerning stockholders . 
We are trying to correct this situation and we hope that the bill will correct it . 
Thus , the bill contains provisions on insider trading . 
As I said , the Bloc is pleased to see them included in the bill . 
It also prohibits threatening or retaliating against employees for disclosing unlawful conduct or for assisting law enforcement officers to investigate cases of capital market fraud . 
These employees also need to be protected against intimidation . 
Of course , when a scandal occurs , when we learn suddenly that someone , particularly if it is at the top level , has committed fraud , we can be sure that some people in the company will keep a low profile . 
If we want them to have a lawful conduct , we must provide these employees with the leeway and the protection they need to be able to act . 
These employees often have a key role to play in disclosing scandals in companies , but they may be intimidated or threatened , including through measures against their job or their livelihood . 
Someone may suggest that , if a certain document is found , perhaps they will lose their job and will be made to pay the price . 
People must be protected from this ; otherwise the threat can be such that some may cave in . 
Even if it cannot be justified , some do it . 
Moreover , at the present time we do not have the necessary tools . 
They must be given adequate protection . 
Creation of a new offence of threat or reprisal relating to employment would encourage people with inside information to co-operate with law enforcement officials and would punish those threatening or making use of reprisals . 
This offence would be punishable with up to five years ' imprisonment . 
Obviously , we are in favour of this provision too . 
Some of the provisions regarding insider trading , threats or reprisals were requested by the Bloc Quebecois and we hope they will be made into law . 
To strengthen penalties in cases of fraud on financial markets , and to make sure that the punishment fits the crime , the proposed reforms would increase maximum sentences for existing fraud offences , and would establish aggravating circumstances , which the courts should take into consideration in sentencing . 
Maximum sentences would rise from 10 to 14 years for the present fraud offences under the Criminal Code , and for those affecting the public market . 
Maximum prison sentences for market manipulation offences would increase from 5 to 10 years . 
The proposed reforms would also include a list of specific aggravating circumstances allowing the courts to impose stiffer sentences for the most serious offences . 
Factors such as the extent of the economic impact or any negative impact on investor confidence or market stability could lead to increased sentences . 
The message is very clear , if you work in that sector and if you act illegally in such a way that it has a major impact on investors ' confidence , you deserve to be penalized accordingly . 
On this side , we want to send a clear message to people who work in that sector , namely that there is no room for fraud because too many people are involved . 
Also , we are talking about the money of too many people -- who often are not the direct investors -- who can lose their savings because of this type of behaviour . 
Moreover , a person 's reputation and standing in the community or work environment , which have always been considered mitigating factors that can reduce penalties , could not apply in such a case . 
It would not be possible to say that the person in question was generously involved in various volunteer activities or that sort of thing . 
If a crime of this nature is committed , such factors cannot be used to reduce the penalty . 
Finally this is a sector in which these factors are often used to minimize the impact of a crime when the wrongdoers are found out , because they are often people with important positions or philanthropic activities . 
But the philanthropic aspect does not , in our opinion , justify reduced penalties . 
And now , the improvements : this bill provides for improved evidence-gathering procedures . 
Some sections have the effect of compelling professionals not to respect their duty of confidentiality . 
Under certain circumstances , this bill can compel a professional to produce documents and even prepare documents that may concern confidential matters , which could certainly come under someone 's privacy . 
Therefore , even though these sections provide that orders to produce may be subject to certain conditions in order to protect privileged communications such as lawyer-client privilege , the fact remains that some confidential information could be divulged , under certain circumstances . 
Thus we might wonder if the fact of compelling a professional to communicate confidential information could undermine the confidential relationship between clients and professionals . 
I think that this is one idea we should explore in committee in order to ensure that the planned measures maintain the necessary balance in this regard , while still ensuring that the bill will have a dissuasive effect . 
We also ought to mention section 487.015 of this bill , which is an attempt to respond to this concern by enabling anyone named in an order under the two preceding sections to apply to a judge for an exemption from the requirement to produce any document , data or information referred to in the order . 
If a person says he does not want to provide the information and has good reason not to do so , he may go before the judge and obtain an exemption . 
So this is a kind of safety net for the protection of the information , but it does not automatically lead to the protection of such information ; the judge is called upon to assess the appropriateness of the request . 
It remains to be seen what criteria judges will use for denying the disclosure of confidential information . 
It will therefore be important at committee stage for witnesses to tell us what these criteria might be , and for us to study the proposals and suggestions . 
We will need to see whether it is appropriate for them to be incorporated in the act , or as regulations , or whether we need to take some other form of action to ensure that there is a clear understanding of the leeway available for obtaining authorization not to transmit this personal information . 
Clause 487.013 allows the banks to disclose confidential information such as the account number , status and type , and the date on which it was opened or closed .  As well , they can provide the account holder 's date of birth , currentaddress and any previous addresses . 
We must point out immediately that this information is an integral part of a person 's private life . 
When they are requested , the individual 's privacy is of necessity being encroached upon . 
It is incumbent upon us to question just how necessary this breach of privacy is to the objective of this bill . 
Quebec and Canada have workable laws to protect privacy . 
These could still be improved , but it is important that the principle be respected . 
We would be very pleased if the clause by clause study of the bill , and the contributions of those appearing before the committee could cast some more light on this , so that we can shape the bill accordingly . 
Finally , I will address the charges by federal prosecutors . 
As I said at the start , this is where we in the Bloc Quebecois have a problem , and this is why . 
The regulation of financial markets is an area that comes under the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces , as does the administration of justice . 
Under this bill , the Attorney General of Canada would have concurrent jurisdiction with the provinces and territories to prosecute certain criminal fraud cases , including the proposed new offence of illegal insider trading . 
Federal involvement in this area would supposedly be limited to a narrow range of cases that threaten the national interest in the integrity of capital markets . 
These limits need to be very precisely defined . 
There may be a way to vote in favour of this bill , if we receive enough guarantees on this point and on the whole issue of federal prosecutors . 
According to information released by the federal government , the Government of Canada will work with the provinces to ensure proper and efficient concurrent jurisdiction by establishing prosecution protocols . 
But between statements of good faith by the federal government and reality , there is often a grey area . 
I understand that measures to protect provincial jurisdictions should be adequate , clear and precise , and meet the approval of the Government of Quebec and the other provinces . 
For many years , the federal government , through the former finance minister , the member for LaSalle -- Émard , wanted to implement a Canada-wide securities commission , and thereby intervene directly in provincial jurisdiction . 
We have to make sure that the federal government does not achieve through the back door what it has so far failed to do through the front door . 
We now see what the hon. member for LaSalle -- Émard thinks about transferring money to the municipalities . 
In a very roundabout fashion , he is proposing direct involvement in the municipalities in full view of the provinces . 
He is blackmailing the municipalities , saying that if they want money , they must tell their province to sign the agreement . 
This amounts to political bargaining , which is unacceptable and does not respect areas of jurisdiction . 
So , if this can be done with the sales tax , it may be possible to do it indirectly through this bill . 
We must ensure that this is not the direction we are heading in . 
Consequently , we cannot support these new provisions . 
They confirm , in our minds , the federal government 's new desire to get involved in the securities sector , which is the responsibility of Quebec and the provinces , as I just demonstrated . 
Overall , however , this bill respects a number of the Bloc Quebecois ' proposals . 
It will provide our system , in Quebec and Canada , with the tighter controls it needs , at a time when people have lost confidence , to some extent , in the markets and the securities sector . 
So , we must send a clear signal . 
This bill contains some interesting measures to reinforce a system that , fortunately , in Quebec , was already better than the Canadian system . 
The only thing left to do is ensure that Quebec 's jurisdiction is respected . 
If so , the Bloc Quebecois will vote in favour of this bill at second reading . 
Once there have been consultations and once the committee has heard from witnesses , if we are assured that Quebec 's constitutional jurisdiction will be respected , we will vote in favour of the bill at third reading . 
We will thus have helped create legislation to build an even better securities sector , and we will have also made a satisfactory contribution to the Quebec and Canadian economies . 
Mr. Pierre Paquette ( Joliette , BQ ) 
Madam Speaker , I will begin by congratulating the hon. member for Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques for his presentation . 
This is no easy subject . 
In these 20 minutes he has managed to explain in layman 's terms the key principles of the bill we have before us . 
I would like to revisit one particular aspect , the one crucial for us , namely the regulation of financial markets and the recurring plan of the federal government to create a Canadian securities commission . 
I imagine that everyone is well aware that the present finance minister has sought the advice of Harold MacKay in this undertaking -- the selfsame Harold MacKay who authored the MacKay report , which led to Bill C-8 , a bill we passed after the last election . 
Mr. MacKay proposed the creation of a wise persons ' committee to advise the minister on the best route to take to regulate the securities market across Canada . 
This wise persons ' committee should soon submit its recommendation , which , as on many issues , is likely to be along the lines of establishing a Canadian securities commission . 
Membership would be voluntary , to put pressure on the provinces and Quebec as well . 
The Ontario Securities Commission clearly supports this initiative of a Canada-wide securities commission . 
The federal government 's game plan will be to make sure all the provinces are onside , so as to isolate Quebec , and say , `` Look , we are not forcing you to get onside , but since you are alone on your side , this will be a problem '' . 
I would like to ask the hon. member this : based on the questions he raised and what I just said , is the danger with Bill C-46 not a classic in terms of federal government interference , using a real problem and real concerns of the public -- in this case , small investors and future retirees -- about losing a portion of their savings because of financial fraud ? 
This is a real problem . 
We see it in the municipalities , which have financial needs with respect to infrastructures , we see it with child poverty . 
So , in response to a real problem , a real concern , a solution , be it legislative or financial , is proposed along with a slew of terms and conditions that result in us living in an increasingly centralized country , while what the Fathers of Confederation had in mind was a confederation . 
Without the guarantees the hon. member referred to , Bill C-46 may well become another part in this huge puzzle of the federal government intended to centralize Canada and make it a unitarian state . 
That is my question for him . 
Mr. Paul Crête : 
Madam Speaker , I thank the member for Joliette for his question and , particularly , for remembering the full name of my riding , like you , Madam Speaker ; what a performance . 
More seriously , indeed , with regard to the issue of the Canada-wide securities commission and the fact that the federal government is saying that membership would be voluntary , this is strangely reminiscent of how the federal government has operated in recent years , rolling over everything in its way . 
It is the same thing with the social union . 
But things have been different here in the last 10 years or so . 
Before , when there was a debate in the House of Commons , people would limit their comments to the potential benefits of adopting this kind of behaviour , and not get into whether it was really our responsibility . 
Since the Bloc Quebecois has been here , we have been asking questions and discussing them publicly . 
I believe that , on the issue of the securities commission , if the Bloc Quebecois had not been here for several years to provide the momentum and follow Quebec 's position in this sector , perhaps the securities commission would already exist today . 
But we must keep in mind that the federal government is constantly launching the attack , constantly introducing new initiatives . 
This is why we are waiting to make a final decision on this bill . 
In the absence of a clear signal on the part of the federal government that the other improvements in the bill are accompanied by a respect for Quebec 's jurisdiction , the Bloc Quebecois will not vote in favour of the bill , clearly showing its opposition to such an encroachment on Quebec 's jurisdiction . 
That being said , we have contributed to other improvements because we thought it was the right thing to do . 
We do not believe in legislation based on a worst case scenario ; we believe it is important to have the best legislation possible providing the best economic framework possible . 
Our interesting suggestions were taken into account and we are very happy about that . 
One of the reasons we will delay our final assessment is the current behaviour of the federal government in several files . 
A case in point , which I will not belabour , is the issue of the transfer of the gasoline tax to the municipalities . 
That is another example of a pan-Canadian vision of things shared for the most part by the prime minister in waiting , the member for LaSalle -- Émard . 
His goal is very clearly to keep on denying the reality of what Quebec is . 
I would rather we recognize that the various securities commissions across Canada already have a mandate , that they have a jurisdiction and that they are able to get along . 
If they need a federal interlocutor at the table as a witness to listen and give additional information on the legislation , or if we want to amend the Criminal Code , should we not consider the advice of each provincial securities commission and include it in the bill ? 
Indeed I hope they will come before the committee and say that , given their point of view and the responsibility they have under the Constitution , they will help produce legislation , under the Criminal Code -- a federal jurisdiction -- which will respect the jurisdiction of the provinces over securities commissions . 
As a consequence , the Bloc Quebecois ' contribution has been to put forward the best possible amendments to the bill . 
Let us hope that the federal government will listen to our demand , which would allow us to vote for the bill at third reading , provided the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces is respected . 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( New Brunswick Southwest , PC ) : 
Madam Speaker , I was reading the latest edition of Business Week on this very topic and I wanted to bring some timely information to the House . 
I have a question for the member . 
I am fascinated by the federal and provincial jurisdiction in this area . 
My understanding is that Bill C-46 would give added strength to the federal government but recognizing that jurisdiction is provincial , not taking away from the province . 
I know that is a sensitive issue in the province of Quebec . 
However my understanding is that it would strengthen the federal role but would not diminish the provincial role . 
Is that his understanding of Bill C-46 ? 
Mr. Paul Crête : 
Madam Speaker , we are indeed casting a critical eye on this bill . 
We must ensure that , within the federal jurisdiction , we have the best legislation possible and that the Criminal Code is strengthened . 
Potential defrauders must know that if they engage in illegal activities , they will have to pay the price . 
That is the federal government 's responsibility . 
We must ensure that we have the best legislation possible in that area but , at the same time , we must ensure that the provincial jurisdiction with regard to securities is respected . 
Indeed , we have seen over the last few years that there is no consensus in Canada on the issue of transferring this responsibility to the federal government . 
Earlier , my colleague from Joliette talked about a committee that will have to make recommendations on this subject . 
We must simply ensure that , through Bill C-46 , we are not doing now what the member for LaSalle -- Émard wants to do when he becomes prime minister , which is encroaching on provincial jurisdictions . 
We hope that the final version of Bill C-46 will respect Quebec 's jurisdiction while including in the Criminal Code the tools needed to reassure investors , particularly small investors , as to the safety of the system governing the whole issue of security trading . 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( New Brunswick Southwest , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to put a few points on the record in regard to Bill C-46 , an act to amend the Criminal Code in relation to capital markets fraud , and to enable the authorities to investigate , prosecute and imprison for wrongdoing . 
A short time ago I was talking about an article I happened to be reading in the latest edition of Business Week . 
The bill is in response to what has happened in the United States and , to a lesser degree , obviously , to what has happened in Canada . 
The United States congress , which is the equivalent of our Parliament , recently passed a bill called the Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002 that will tighten up the criminal code in relation to some of the wrongdoings in the business world , and in the investment world in particular . 
One of the famous cases , which I am sure everyone has heard about , was Kozlowski of Tyco International , an individual who was reported to have stolen $ 170 million from the company he represented as chief executive officer . 
In addition to that , there were unauthorized loans and bonuses to fraud investors of that company of another $ 430 million . 
The trial is underway in Manhattan as we speak . 
That is not the only case . 
There have been many . 
We have all heard of the Enron scandal where individuals cooked the books and used accounting deceptions and procedures to make it appear as though the company was making money instead of losing money . 
As a result of that , companies like Enron and WorldCom have gone broke and the employees and shareholders have been left penniless , with the exception of the chief executive officers of those companies . 
Some of those trials are still ongoing and we have yet to know what the outcome of those will be . 
The most famous example of alleged wrongdoing in the marketplace is Martha Stewart . 
The article I was reading from the latest edition of Business Week talks about some of the improprieties that might have been conducted by Martha Stewart and her company in terms of insider trading . 
I only have to remind the House of when the bubble burst for Dotcom and how some of the investment companies themselves worked the system to drive up the initial price offerings of companies , only to cash in the initial offerings that they received at brokerage houses . 
It was discovered there were no earnings behind those inflated prices , no history of earning money and no potential to earn money . 
As a result of that a lot of people suffered needlessly . 
Innocent investors suffered . 
You and I know some of those people , Madam Speaker . 
They are our friends and neighbours who were , the term which is often used is not very sophisticated , sucked into that type of investment thinking they were good investments but which were not good investments . 
The bill before us now would attempt to crack down on some of that illegal activity . 
It would increase the maximum sentences for existing fraud offences , establish a list of aggravating factors to aid the courts in sentencing , allow the courts to issue production orders to obtain data and documents from persons not under investigation and establish concurrent federal jurisdiction to prosecute certain capital market fraud cases . 
That is where the act would have to work in conjunction with the provinces , which would have the lead in any of those prosecutions because of the jurisdiction the provinces enjoy in these areas . 
One point I briefly touched on was insider trader . 
This is where people within the industry provide information to allow their friends to buy shares at a particular price , knowing full well the price will be driven up by a certain announcement , an approval or whatever . 
Bill C-46 creates a new criminal offence of insider trading . 
It is already illegal . 
It would create a new criminal offence with harsher penalties . 
This is a topic that members have heard me speak to time and time again in the House . 
In fact I have a bill before the House now , Bill C-241 , entitled the whistleblower 's bill . 
It would provide whistleblowers within the public service a level of protection . 
When they see something wrong within government , public servants can in fact blow the whistle . 
In other words , they can report that wrongdoing knowing full well that their jobs will be protected . 
They will not be run out of the government or dismissed from the government or treated unfairly in any way for uncovering wrongdoing . 
One thing Bill C-46 would do is provide whistleblowing protection to employees who expose wrongdoing under federal or provincial law . 
A new criminal offence of employment related threats or retaliation would carry a maximum term of five years . 
In other words , people within the corporate structure could in fact be prosecuted under criminal law for subjecting their employees to that type of harassment or punishment simply because they were reporting wrongdoing . 
I think that would allow many more people to come forward when they see that happening within capital markets or within investment houses . 
One of the best examples of that I believe was with one of the top executives of Merrill Lynch .  Knowing full well what was going on within Enron , he was very reluctant to classify Enron as a good buy in the investment market . 
He was punished by his own company . 
He was ostracized and humiliated . 
Eventually he had to leave the corporation simply because he was telling the truth . 
This type of legislation would protect individuals like him . 
The current maximum sentence for fraud and fraud affecting the public market would rise from 10 years to 14 years . 
The sentences would be stiffened up . 
The maximum term for fraudulent manipulation of stock exchange transactions would rise to ten years from five years . 
The other component of Bill C-46 , which I never thought of myself until going through this legislation and understanding some of the work the committee did and how it actually arrived at this specific component , is it adds a list of specific aggravating factors that would result in harsher penalties , such as the extent of economic damage caused or the impact on market stability . 
Again , if we look at Enron , it is the biggest corporate collapse in the history of the United States . 
The penalty for that would be much more severe because a lot of hardship was imposed on an awful lot of people , not only its employees but individual investors who had put their entire life savings into some of Enron 's stock . 
They wreaked havoc on the lives of a lot of people , including some of their employees . 
Those types of aggravating factors would be considered when sentencing was handed out . 
A person 's reputation and status in the community or workplace can no longer be considered as a mitigating factor in lower penalties in cases where those who commit capital markets fraud rely on those very factors to carry out their crimes . 
Let us take the example of Martha Stewart . 
I hate to pick on her . 
I am not sure that is fair . 
However , we could argue that Ms. Stewart has done some good in the community , even though we do not see all of it . 
No one would argue that in terms of donations or sponsoring specific groups . 
What now will happen is her profile in the community will no longer be considered a factor in terms of the sentencing . 
In other words , all the good we do will not be part of the sentencing . 
We will be treated as harshly as the next person , despite some of the public good we may have done . 
If we look at the Enron case , that was the defence some of the executives used ; look at the public good and how well they had behaved themselves in the community in terms of charitable donations , et cetera . 
This would discourage that . 
In other words , it really boils down to the fact that they can not hide under that cover . 
They would be sentenced on the severity of the offence they perpetrated and could not hide under the cover of a public name or having done public good in the past . 
We support the bill and hope that it can be strengthened as we go along . 
Normally this would be left up to our justice critic to debate this but our justice critic now just happens to be our party leader . 
I am not sure where it is in terms of parliamentary committee . 
I do know the Senate banking committee spent about a year looking at the bill . 
During its study , it examined other jurisdictions like the United States . 
The U.S. Congress passed a bill , which mentioned earlier , about a year ago now . 
Some of the things that were recommended are not in this bill , and I just want to put those on the record . 
There are obviously a lot of good things in the bill , but some things have been left out and here are just a few of them . 
Code of ethics -- 
Hon. Don Boudria : 
Madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
I apologize to the hon. member . 
For greater clarity , although it has been discussed by House leaders and perhaps alluded to , I want to confirm to the House that the reference for Bill C-38 , presently scheduled to be debated tomorrow , is reference to committee before second reading . 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
Madam Speaker , I am as puzzled as I think you are by that intervention . 
I do not think I am alone in that . 
However we respect the House leader for standing up and doing his best to provide clarity , if nothing else . 
I was talking about some of the things that were left out of the bill such as : board and audit committee members being independent ; limiting non-audit services that auditors could provide to their clients ; and requiring an organization 's chief executive officer and chief financial officer to certify that the annual financial statements fairly represent the organization .  In other words , to ensure that the information that executives are presenting is true , fair and accurate . 
Another recommendation was to prohibit compensation committee members from being a member of management and require them to have expertise in compensation and human resources . 
This is the human side of it and I think it would go a long way . 
This is not just about investors or capital markets . 
It is about the kinds of wealth that capital markets can create provided that we have confidence in those capital markets . 
That confidence has been tarnished in recent years for the reasons we have outlined , and which most members have . 
To get back to a level of respectability , when we and our neighbours invest , we need to be confident that the accounting information and the recommendations we receive from stock brokers and others is accurate and not tainted . 
If the information is tainted and not represented properly by those representing the company , we need to know there will be consequences for those people such as stiffer sentencing and prison time , as some Enron and Tyco executives will serve if proven guilty . 
I think we all support this type of legislation . 
It is a little slower coming to the House than it was in the United States of America , but I think we have had a chance to identify some of the weaknesses in its legislation . 
I know our party is prepared to support the government on this initiative . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville -- Musquodoboit Valley -- Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Madam Speaker , with the trade deals that we enter into with the United States and Mexico in terms of NAFTA , can the member see any problems with this type of legislation in the event of the NAFTA rules or any kind of trade rules which may affect or protect foreign companies from this type of legislation ? 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
Madam Speaker , I guess it is all a question of sovereignty . 
Criminal activity is criminal activity and they really cannot be protected by trade agreements . 
I understand the angle the member for the NDP is taking . 
We have heard that argument before . 
I think that has been addressed by the trade minister and by the government , maybe not completely to his satisfaction . 
However I know , when we talk of wrongdoing and criminal offences , no trade deal in the world can protect individuals from that type of wrongdoing . 
It is not so much the interpretation of a particular trade rule or an agreement . 
It is very much about criminal activity . 
When that can be identified , they are prosecuted and they would not be immune regardless of what trade deal it might be and regardless of what jurisdiction in which type of activity would take place . 
I am pretty confident there is really no argument in terms of protection of these wrongdoers . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
Before I proceed with more questions and comments , it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows : the hon. member for Renfrew -- Nipissing -- Pembroke , National Defence . 
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I am pleased to participate in this debate on Bill C-46 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( capital markets fraud and evidence gathering ) . 
This is a very important piece of the puzzle that is needed in Canada to reassert and re-establish confidence in capital markets . 
The stories we hear about Enron and WorldCom in the United States create some questions in our minds as to what this means for Canada . 
We have heard of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation in the United States and many wonder why we are not implementing similar legislation . 
A number of us on this side of the House decided to pursue this question . 
The capital markets provide the lubrication for the efficient operation of Canada 's economy . 
If the markets are threatened , the economic growth in Canada is impeded . 
Fewer jobs are created and the economic well-being of Canadians is attacked . 
When we look at what has gone on in the United States with Enron and WorldCom and the response in terms of the congressional and legislative approach in Sarbanes-Oxley , we need to understand that Canada has a different set of capital markets . 
Canada has a different mosaic in terms of the jurisdictions that are involved in the capital markets . 
We need to design our own solutions here in Canada . 
Bill C-46 is a very good start . 
It deals mostly with the enforcement and compliance components of dealing with capital markets fraud . 
Bill C-46 introduces new measures to strengthen enforcement against serious capital market fraud offences , measures previously outlined in budget 2003 . 
This legislation tackles capital market fraud by creating a new Criminal Code offence of improper insider trading . 
It also protects employees who report unlawful conduct within their corporation from retaliation by creating a new employment related intimidation offence . 
Bill C-46 also raises the maximum sentences for existing fraud offences and establishes aggravating factors to assist the courts in determining a sentence that would reflect the seriousness of the crime . 
It also enhances the evidence gathering tools available to investigators by amending the Criminal Code . 
These are very important measures supported by the six integrated market enforcement teams that will be established across Canada over the next two years . 
These teams will be comprised of RCMP investigators , forensic accountants , lawyers and other investigative experts . 
These teams will be responsible for tracking down corporate criminals and deterring future occurrences of these crimes . 
This is a very important enforcement and compliance measure which I certainly support . 
Canada is exposed to economic crime along the lines of Enron and WorldCom . 
In fact , many would argue that we have had some occurrences of that already . 
Many members in the House and many individuals across Canada are familiar with Bre-X Minerals . 
YBM Magnex , Philip Services , Livent Inc. , Laidlaw , Cinar and Castor Holdings were fairly sizeable market frauds perpetuated here in Canada . 
We need to deal with this in Canada as well . 
When we look at the approach to dealing with this type of economic fraud in Canada , we find that there is quite a quilt of different players and different jurisdictions . 
For example , the Canadian Public Accountability Board has been set up to monitor the independence and the role of auditors when they examine financial statements . 
This body , which is actually chaired by the former governor of the Bank of Canada , will establish the rules by which audit firms can engage in non-audit work , such as tax work or management consulting , for audit clients of listed companies . 
It will set these guidelines in the sense of when auditing firms will be seen to have crossed the line of conflict of interest . 
It will also ensure that the firms that are auditing public companies have established mechanisms for quality control , for professional development . 
It will have the authority to delist auditors who fail to comply with the rules that have been established by this particular entity . 
Our group that looked at this believes that this needs to be given a chance to work . 
We have confidence that it will work and it will deal with the question of auditor independence and auditor quality control . 
When we look at the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation that was passed in the United States , there are many important best practices that are established in Sarbanes-Oxley dealing with the separation of the chairman and CEO roles , the question of the independence of directors and a host of other issues . 
What we need to do here in Canada is make sure that we pick those best practices that were established and where there is general consensus within the financial and investor community , these best practices should be adopted , whether they are in Canada , the United States or anywhere . 
There is an important tool in Canada to show leadership in this particular area , and that is the Canada Business Corporations Act . 
The Canada Business Corporations Act affects many companies in Canada . 
In terms of the breadth of coverage of the Canada Business Corporations Act , it is something like 17 % of all companies in Canada . 
It is quite a sizeable grouping of companies that are incorporated under this federal statute .  It is through this act that the federal government can exert some leadership by building into the Canada Business Corporations Act some of the best practices that most observers would conclude are the best practices in terms of corporate governance and a host of other items . 
One of those is the splitting of the chairman and CEO roles . 
It is probably more advantageous to separate those roles so that the chairman operates more independently and can act on a more objective basis on behalf of all the shareholders .  We have the question of the independence of the boards of directors . 
Too often we find that the board of directors is selected indirectly by the executive management group of corporations .  They ultimately can become beholden to the management of the company . 
It seems to me that we need to have independent directors on the boards of public companies and we need quite a large number of them . 
Let us look at the audit committees . 
Probably most public companies today have audit committees . 
It is quite important that these audit committees have directors that are well versed in financial reporting and financial affairs so that they can diligently do their work , listen to the reports of the external auditors and the internal auditors and take the steps that are necessary to protect the interests of the shareholders and other stakeholders . 
In Canada , as I said earlier , there are a number of jurisdictions involved in dealing with corporate governance . 
For example , the federal government is responsible for the regulation of trade and commerce . 
It is responsible for banking and the incorporation of banks . 
It is responsible for patents and copyright . 
It is responsible for peace , order and good government and other matters not exclusively assigned to the provinces . 
By the same measure , provinces are responsible for the incorporation of companies with provincial objects . 
They are responsible for property and civil rights in the province . 
They are responsible for the management of lands and resources and generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province . 
As I said earlier when I gave the percentage of 17 % , that is the percentage of listed companies that are federally incorporated . 
In fact the Canada Business Corporations Act applies to roughly 40 % of all corporations , listed or not , in Canada . 
One of the aspects that our little group on this side of the House looked at was whether we need to differentiate the rules on corporate governance as they relate to large corporations and small corporations . 
We felt that we should . 
How to define large corporations versus small corporations is something that needs to be looked at in more detail . 
Our group felt that large corporations have the breadth of resources , the scope of management and the scope of operation that they could be expected to have corporate governance at a higher level than some small companies that are restrained simply by the economies of scale , the very size and scope of their operations . 
In Canada we need to ensure that we have capital markets that are operating efficiently and effectively . 
We also have players that monitor and regulate the securities industry . 
There are securities commissions in every province across Canada . 
One initiative that our government has been pursuing for some time is to have a national securities commission or regulator that would bring all the provincial securities commissions under one roof . 
This would be the most cost effective and the most efficient way of doing it . 
If a company wants to list in Canada , right now it has to go to all the various provincial securities regulators . 
A national securities agency would be very efficient and effective . 
Unfortunately the politics , as they sometimes do , get caught in the middle of this . 
Certain provinces want to see that happen and others do not . 
However , in terms of corporate governance and in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness of capital markets , having a national securities regulator would certainly go a long way to improving our corporate governance in Canada and would restore more confidence in the capital markets . 
One of the securities commissions that plays a very lead role across Canada is the Ontario Securities Commission , simply because of its size , the number of listings , the number of companies in Ontario , the Toronto Stock Exchange being in Toronto , and much of the activity that takes place in Ontario and the large concentration of industrial activity . 
The Ontario Securities Commission falls under the Ontario Securities Act . 
This regulatory body is responsible for overseeing the securities industry in Ontario . 
It plays quite an important role in monitoring the compliance in corporate governance and financial reporting . 
One thing we learned from the financial debacles in the United States and Canada , whether it was Enron , WorldCom , Livent here in Canada , or Bre-X , is the importance of financial reports that are accurate and reflect economic reality . 
The public companies especially have to come up with quarterly reports . 
There is huge pressure on management to show continued growth and earnings per share . 
Sometimes they are caught in a situation where they perhaps have to compromise their principles and distort the economic realities so that their shares can keep moving forward , especially if they have executive compensation schemes and stock options . 
Stock options for executives is something that is here to stay . 
Our group on this side looked at the need for those stock option schemes and the way that executives and the management team are compensated to be clearly transparent . 
If the president has a number of stock options , it should not be hidden away in note 25 of the annual report . 
It should be highlighted , perhaps in the chairman 's report or the president 's report . 
It should be fully disclosed so that all shareholders are aware of the extent to which the management team participates in the profitability of the firm . 
The group that we assembled would like to see some of the best practices of corporate governance incorporated into the Canada Business Corporations Act . 
There should be sanctions for failure to disclose financial information in a responsible and accurate way , especially for the CEO and the chief financial officer . 
If it is shown that the CEO and the chief financial officer misrepresented the financial statements of the company , there should be severe sanctions for that because there are many Canadians -- directly or indirectly , through the stock market , pension plans or mutual funds -- who are relying on the integrity of the financial reports . 
Right now , under the Canada Business Corporations Act , the sanctions for misreporting financial information is minimal . 
We would like to see that beefed up along the lines of the measures that were introduced by the Ontario Securities Commission and along the lines of the legislation before us here today in terms of the Criminal Code . 
In Ontario the penalties in the budget measures act of 2002 increased the fines and maximum prison terms for general offences , such as misrepresenting corporate financials from $ 1 million to $ 5 million and prison sentences from two years to five years less a day . 
The American equivalent , increased by the Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002 , is a fine of up to $ 5 million and/or up to a maximum prison sentence of 20 years . 
As I said earlier , we believe that the Canada Business Corporations Act could be amended to increase both the fines and prison terms so that they are more in line with those of the Ontario Securities Commission . 
That would mean a fine of up to $ 5 million and/or a prison sentence of up to five years less a day . 
Bill C-46 is an important bill and I want to talk about why we should support it in the House . 
It is part of a thrust of initiatives that must be looked at in a coherent way in Canada . 
We cannot just say Sarbanes-Oxley . 
It would not apply in Canada . 
If we were to legislate Sarbanes-Oxley here in the House of Commons , it would be thrown out because we do not have that kind of constitutional power . 
However , by the same token , the Canadian Public Accountability Board must do its job in ensuring that auditing quality controls are good and that there are no conflicts . 
The Ontario Security Commission must pushing for strong rules in terms of good corporate governance , independent directors , separation of duties between the chairman and the CEO. There must be a requirement for good , honest financial reporting and severe sanctions . 
The Canada Business Corporations Act must incorporate the very best practices and ensure that if CEOs and chief financial officers do not play by the rules they will either go to jail or will pay heavy fines . 
Then Canadians would be protected , the capital markets would be efficient and effective , and people would have confidence in the capital markets in Canada . 
In conclusion , this is a bill worthy of the support of the House . 
We should be pushing and promoting these other measures , especially the Canada Business Corporations Act amendments . 
I am confident that our government will bring forward those solutions in the not too distant future . 
Business of the House [ Business of the House ] 
Mr. Paul Harold Macklin ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , discussions have taken place between all parties , as well as the member for Churchill , concerning the taking of the division on Motion No. 197 scheduled at the conclusion of private members ' business later this day .  I believe you would find consent for the following motion .  I move : 
That at the conclusion of today 's debate on Motion No. 197 , all questions necessary to dispose of the motion be deemed put , a recorded division deemed requested and deferred to Tuesday , October 21 , 2003 , at the end of Government Orders . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
The House has heard the terms of the motion . 
Is it agreed ? 
Some hon. members : Agreed . 
( Motion agreed to ) 
Criminal Code 
The House resumed consideration of Bill C-46 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( capital markets fraud and evidence-gathering ) , be read the second time and referred to a committee . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville -- Musquodoboit Valley -- Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Madam Speaker , the hon. member who spoke previously talked about his judgment .  In many cases I respect his judgment . 
I have a couple of questions for him on this particular legislation . 
He did not quite clearly say what would be the governing body that would oversee these companies , corporations and businesses alike who commit these types of acts . 
Would it be a branch of the RCMP or would it be a separate organization on its own that would have complete authority to go in to do audits , checks and bring charges forward ? 
There is the other concern about whistle-blower protection for employees . 
As we know , there have been a few major cases in the United States , a tobacco company and Enron , for instance . 
How does he foresee the bill protecting employees who use their initiative to blow the whistle on these particular types of corporations ? 
His government entered into NAFTA talks with the United States , Canada and Mexico . 
Does he foresee any problems with those trade deals when it comes to enacting this type of legislation on a domestic basis ? 
Mr. Roy Cullen : 
Madam Speaker , with respect to the first question as to which body would be responsible for enforcement , we need to differentiate between civil and criminal enforcement , and compliance and sanctions . 
Bill C-46 deals with criminal behaviour in terms of fraudulent activity , misrepresenting financial information , insider trading and protecting whistle-blowers . 
That is precisely one of the aspects with which the bill deals . 
It deals with criminal sanctions and calls for prison terms and fines . 
Market enforcement teams would be established across Canada , as I said earlier , over the next of years . 
They would be composed of RCMP investigators , forensic accountants , lawyers and other investigative experts . 
The teams would be responsible for tracking down corporate criminals and deterring future occurrences of these crimes . 
On the civil side , we have the Ontario Securities Commission that has sanctions of prison terms and fines for CEOs and chief financial officers who misrepresent economic realities in the financial statements . 
We have the Canada Business Corporations Act which could also have some civil penalties . 
The point we have also made is that if we were to increase the sanctions under the Canada Business Corporations Act , the member is absolutely right to note that we would have to have the teeth and resources to monitor compliance and then we would have to have the resources to prosecute where companies were not following through on their responsibilities under the Canada Business Corporations Act , or indeed under the rules of the Ontario Securities Commission . 
But the Ontario Securities Commission would be something with which they would deal . 
As Canadians , we should be monitoring how effective and productive these different players are in dealing with these issues because we will gain some experience and knowledge of how it is all working as we move forward . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Madam Speaker , does the member foresee any kind of problems in the future regarding the trade deals we have signed in terms of many companies and corporations being of an international or multinational type basis ? 
Does he see any problems in initiating this type of domestic law when it comes to these trade deals ? 
Mr. Roy Cullen : 
Madam Speaker , I guess in a word , no . 
However , to add to that , the intent in the world community of financial players is to have some element of harmonization around these rules . 
For example , in Canada we have companies that are cross-listed on the TSX and also the New York Stock Exchange , and they could be on other exchanges as well . 
I know there is a lot of discussion going on now on how this can be harmonized to the extent possible . 
If anything , there will be a push toward harmonization . 
A company reporting in Canada and listed on the TSX and the New York Stock Exchange will have the same requirements so that it does not have to go through the motions once or twice . 
The member is aware that under the WTO there is a move afoot on financial services to free up the trade in financial services . 
Our government is very much involved with that WTO initiative . 
I think it is ongoing and it will be a positive step when it comes to fruition . 
I do not see any conflicts in terms of trade rules . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville -- Musquodoboit Valley -- Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Madam Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to speak on behalf of my party and the hon. member for Regina -- Qu'Appelle to Bill C-46 . 
Bill C-46 is the sister bill to Bill C-45 , the Westray bill . 
I want to say at the outset that my party supports the bill in principle , although we would have liked a few amendments and further discussion in committee . 
I consider the bill to be important legislation and something that is long overdue . 
Our research department has indicated to me that David Lewis , Ed Broadbent , Tommy Douglas and others of our party asked for corporate accountability for a long time . 
Now we are starting to slowly see a bit of that . 
We have to give credit where it is due , which is to the media for the way it covered the Enron story and the Bre-X story . 
Canadians are saying that enough is enough . 
Canadians are concerned about where their investment dollars go . 
Workers and their families are concerned about where their pension dollar goes . 
Nothing can make people more sick to their stomach in terms of our own money than when we see the head of Enron living in a lavish mansion in Florida , with I do not know how many rooms , while the workers at Enron have lost all their pensionable savings . 
How that can happen in a free and open democratic society like the United States is beyond me . 
The question is , can it happen here ? 
Without legislation it probably could . 
We are hoping this particular bill has teeth . 
In order to have teeth , as my hon. colleague said earlier , we must ensure that the authorities who oversee and regulate this type of legislation , whether it be a commission , the RCMP , domestic police services or whoever , have the final authority to investigate , bring charges and make them stick . 
They will also need the resources because we know these corporations have deep pockets . 
They could tie up cases of this type in the courts for a long time .  It is just the way the legal system is sometimes . 
We must ensure that the people who will be prosecuting these companies or corporations in the future have the resources and the technical ability to carry it through . 
Otherwise , this will fall like a deck of cards . 
Another concern is the protection of employees . 
Although the bill does discuss whistleblower protection , we do not think it goes far enough . 
Clause 6 of Bill C-46 makes threats and retaliation against employees an offence punishable either as an indictable offence , which carries the maximum sentence of five years , or as a summary offence . 
It is quite curious that the government is introducing a law that exposes an employer who makes threats to a punishment that is less than that of extortion . 
This is especially worrisome when the purpose of clause 6 is to deter employers from committing economic extortion . 
What we mean by that is that the threat will always be there for employees . 
What will happen to an employee who decides that someone in the legal or political world needs to know that what is happening in the company is simply not right ? 
Many people will hold back because they do not want to lose their jobs . 
As well , if people are in a particular trade or in the financial services world and they become blacklisted , who will hire them ? 
No one should be punished for telling the truth but a lot of people in the corporate world have that fear hanging over them . 
We also have it in the public service world . 
I will just go off track for a moment . 
It is interesting that the commissioner of the Coast Guard , Mr. Adams , would write a letter to all his employees and say that if any of them have contact with a member of Parliament the Coast Guard wants to know the details of any conversations . 
Why would the commissioner of the Coast Guard want to know about my conversation with an employee of the Coast Guard ? 
It is none of the commissioner 's business . 
In a free and open , democratic society , people , in my opinion , have the right to speak to their member of Parliament on any subject . 
To turn back to the corporate world , we want to ensure that when people within the corporate world see , hear or feel that something is drastically wrong they will be allowed to speak openly . 
If they are wrong , the court of public opinion will weigh heavily upon them , but if they are right , they will be doing our country a great service . 
As I said before , many of these corporations hire lot of people in this country , and thankfully they do , which is part of the good thing about businesses in this country working hand in hand with government to create a mixed economy , something I have always supported . 
However the reality is that we must protect people 's pensions . 
We must ensure they have proper working environments and reliable salaries and wages to base their living on . 
I come from the airline world . 
When Canadian Airlines merged with Air Canada I could not help but notice that Air Canada wanted to delay or hold back some of its employees ' pension liability funds .  We simply will never accept that . 
The 11th commandment in the world is `` Thou shalt not fool around with thy pension '' . 
A pension is what a lot of people work for , be they in the auto industry , the forestry industry , the airline industry or even members of Parliament for that matter . 
The fact is that when we leave our places of employment after many years of service we rely on that pension plan to ease ourselves into retirement . 
For anybody , be it government or business , to attempt to fool around with that pension plan is despicable and criminal . 
I am hoping the bill will deal with issues of that nature down the road . 
I think the essence of the bill is accountability , transparency , openness and fairness . 
It would ensure that when corporations show us their books and tell us that they were audited fairly by an independent agency that they will not be buffaloing , masking the figures or whatever , that those are the facts . 
Who will ever forget Bre-X ? 
I remember people telling me many years ago that I had to get into this Bre-X because it was so hot . 
They told me that I would be able to retire early if I invested in Bre-X . 
It was around $ 95 a share at that time . 
I possibly should have invested and left when it reached about $ 130 or $ 140 but I do not think I would have . 
I probably would have been like most investors , been a little greedy , held on and then lost everything . 
Why ? 
Because Bre-X and the people behind it lied to the investors and to the Canadian people . 
It was out and out fraud . 
How many people lost their shirts on that ? 
How many investors were shaken in the stock market because the stock market commissions were not able to or could not , for whatever reason , find out until it was too late ? 
This bill should send a clear warning to companies telling them that if they are thinking about attempting to defraud investors , to screw their employees and everything else , we will keep a very close eye on them . 
Again , we can only keep that close eye on them if we have the resources and the manpower to get that job done . 
It may be my perception but , like anywhere else in a capitalist society , people can make large amounts of money if they are smart , know the right people and have a lot of luck at the same time . 
The thing is that a lot of those companies in the United States , and the list goes on and on , are corrupt . 
They use smoke and mirrors . 
They have influence and conduct insider trading . 
It goes on and on , and a lot of them get away with it . 
However it appears that the United States is not afraid to go after the big guys . 
We saw the impeachment of Richard Nixon . 
We saw them go after Bill Clinton . 
We saw them go after the seventh largest corporation in the United States , Enron . 
The Americans do not appear to be afraid of these individuals , the amount of money they have or their influence . 
If they have done something wrong or it is perceived that they have done something wrong in the United States the government will go after them . 
The problem in the United States , as it is here , is that far too many companies get away with those kinds of things and that is completely unacceptable . 
I will give a quick analysis that was done by our research department . 
The integrity of our public markets and strong investor confidence has been an important issue for security regulators for a long time because these principles are the necessary foundation for any successful market . 
We in the NDP always question the market system of our economy . 
Many of us in the NDP like a mixed market economy , one with the private sector along with government . 
We think government could be an appropriate tool and an appropriate avenue to work with private business to develop the economy so that we can equally share our resources across the country . 
As our famous leader of the CCF , J. S. Woodsworth , once said `` What we desire for ourselves , we wish for all '' . 
If the market is perceived to be corrupt or influenced in any way , shape or form by some shady characters or some outside sources that makes investors very nervous and they will put their money somewhere else . 
The main contribution that Bill C-46 makes to this effort is to act as a greater deterrent to would-be insider traders and provide courts with the authority to compel the production of documents to determine the nature and extent of insider trading . 
Insider trading is a tempting way to take care of one 's friends . 
If we had a lot of stock , let us say in Air Canada , which I believe is trading now at anywhere between $ 1.10 and $ 1.30 , and we knew tomorrow that a big deal would be coming up for Air Canada that could raise the price of shares , would we not love to know that information beforehand so we could either buy more or sell out , depending on the circumstances ? 
There are not too many Canadians who would not love to have that type of information but that information , called insider trading , is extremely dangerous to the confidence of all other investors . 
What happens is that only a select few , those in the inner circle of whatever that kind of information will assist , will get it , while the vast majority of investors will be left out in the cold . 
That is simply wrong . 
I am glad to see that the bill actually tries to do something about that . 
The codification of aggravating sentencing factors and the elimination of mitigating factors , such as status and reputation , if those attributes were relevant to the commission of the offence , will develop a more consistent and certain punishment regime . 
That is something we support . 
If corporate criminals want to commit those kinds of act and break the trust of investors and ordinary Canadians , we believe they should be punished to the fullest extent of the law . 
We like the idea of punishment for fraud going from 10 years to 14 years , fraud affecting capital markets going from 10 years to 14 years and market manipulation going from 5 years to 10 years . 
I want to make sure that it just does not say `` Here is your 14 year sentence but , by the way , if you serve one-third of it , with good behaviour off you go '' . 
No .  We have to make a strong deterrent and make sure that 14 years means 14 years . 
I know of other concerns . 
Let us look at someone who commits a criminal act and gets eight years . 
I had an individual in my riding who had eight previous impaired charges and on the ninth one he actually killed someone , an 18 year old girl . 
He was sentenced to eight years but only served two of them . 
Many citizens in my riding , including myself , were extremely upset when that sentence was reduced . 
It is just like Bill C-46 on corporate crime . 
When the head of a major company , which employees thousands of people , defrauds their pension plans , he or she only gets a few years while the employees lose all their savings and lose everything , which means that if they had no private savings of their own and have no other means of supporting themselves they will then turn to the government for assistance . 
The government should try to prevent that by making sure that if the bill says 14 years , then that is what the person gets , not 3 years and not if they are really good in jail they can go early . 
That is nonsense . 
The NDP will ensure that further amendments come to this bill . 
We have always said that corporate accountability , business accountability , is extremely important . 
To the best of our ability we will make the government aware that any agencies or regulatory authorities must have the manpower and the resources to carry out identification and charging , to ensure that they have the wherewithal to carry through with those cases . 
As I said earlier , companies can be charged but when the companies have all kinds of money to fight these cases , they can tie them up in the courts for a long , long time with appeal after appeal . 
Our judicial system must have the authority , the manpower and the staying power to ensure that cases result in convictions . 
In the end we must protect the investors , protect our workers and protect fellow businesses not only in this country but around the world . 
If we prove to investors around the world who are looking to invest in Canada that we have a fair , transparent and open system , that would go a long way in building our economy in the future . 
There is still an unanswered question to which I have not received a satisfactory answer . 
It has to do with trade deals such as the WTO , NAFTA , or whatever they may be . 
Now that many of these companies are becoming very international in their nature , will this domestic law stand up to those trade deals in terms of people who own companies but do not actually reside in Canada ? 
Will we be able to bring them to court satisfactorily with these trade deals hanging over us ? 
Will those trade deals impede us from bringing this type of domestic legislation to the forefront ? 
I do not know , but I would like those questions answered . 
I am proud to say that our party will be supporting this bill in principle . 
Mr. Pierre Paquette ( Joliette , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his speech . 
First , he said that the New Democratic Party had a very broad vision of what the market rules are .  In other words , they needed to be limited to ensure that small investors , especially workers who invest their money in pension funds , are not swindled by financial or other harmful practices with respect to securities in particular . 
I want to know what he thinks about the suggestion from Mark Pieth , OECD 's expert on money laundering , who , after the Enron and other scandals , advised governments to work on regulations concerning the use of tax havens by their national companies . 
I would like to know if , in his opinion , beyond Bill C-46 , we should not be working on limiting the use of tax havens by Canadian and other companies . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , my hon. colleague from the Bloc Quebecois has raised a very important point about the extension of this bill in the consideration of tax havens around the world . 
The Bloc actually had a motion on this aspect , and I believe it concerned either the Barbados or the Bahamas , which we fully supported . 
The government did not , but we fully supported that motion . 
We know that companies have the ability to hide their money , to move it in all kinds of directions . 
That is something that as an international community we definitely have to work on . 
The House passed a motion a few years ago regarding the Tobin tax , a small , very minute tax on financial speculation in order to use that money for the common good of the world . 
There is one thing I will say to the Bloc member . 
One very successful pension plan is the one in Quebec . 
My father-in-law is now retired and that pension plan like anything else is probably not doing as well as it could be , but it has done extremely well for the people of Quebec . 
The people of Quebec should be quite proud of that pension plan because it was a very good thing . 
Not only my father-in-law but many people I have spoken to in Quebec rely upon that very seriously for their income . 
It is a very successful plan . 
If we had more plans like that throughout our country and around the world for families and employers and businesses , it would go a long way in alleviating financial concerns for people in their retirement . 
Mr. Paul Harold Macklin ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to make a few comments on my hon. friend 's commentary . 
I want to congratulate him on supporting this bill in principle . 
He made some comments that were directed toward the enforcement of this bill and ultimately how we make it function within our market process . 
He is likely aware of the integrated market enforcement teams that are being set up by the RCMP as a process of trying to put together a system that will adequately enforce these measures with skilled people who are up to date in the technology of the day and the ways in which one goes about this . 
With respect to funding , under that initiative there would be $ 8.1 million spent in this fiscal year , or at least designated for that purpose . 
In the subsequent year there would be $ 13.2 million and $ 17.5 million in each of the subsequent three years . 
If the member has any concerns about the fact that we are prepared to put our money behind the enforcement process , I think we are definitely prepared to do so . 
Does the member think that this is the right approach ? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , I certainly do not question the intent of the hon. member 's statement regarding the fact that money has been allocated to the integrated market enforcement team . 
He did not say whether it was new money or just readjusted money within the RCMP . 
Anybody who has followed the RCMP over the last few years knows that they are starved for resources . 
We are short approximately 2,000 RCMP officers in the country today . 
They simply do not have the ability to do all the tasks that we ask them to do . 
When we are setting up something new called an integrated market enforcement team , which includes RCMP investigators , federal lawyers , et cetera , I guess I can answer a question with a question , is it new money for this team or is it money that has been taken from somewhere else in the budget of the RCMP ? 
What has been cut or what has been overlooked in order to do this ? 
If he would like to say it is brand new money , then I would say good for him . 
But if it is money that has been taken out of a department that is already starved for resources , for example we have heard that they are contemplating closing the forensic labs in Halifax , Regina and Edmonton , that is something we simply would not accept . 
That is the kind of concern we have in terms of money going toward the agency . 
Is it new money out of the general overall budget or is it money that has been redirected within the existing RCMP budget ? 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if the member were to make one change to the bill that was substantive enough to get the support of the NDP , what change would that be ? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , there are all kinds of them but off the top , without having a chance to go through in my mind what it should be , I would say it would be to strengthen the whistleblower protection , make sure that it is stronger . 
There should be an ironclad guarantee , without consequences , that employees who blow the whistle , who state on the public record what has happened , are protected , that their families are protected , that their incomes are protected . 
Their salaries and their futures must be protected .  The people who tried to use economic terrorism against those employees , or groups of employees , the people who actually commit that type of infraction , the employers , must be dealt with severely and harshly . 
I guess that is the one thing . 
I should remind the hon. member that we support the bill in principle . 
We would like to see it go to committee so we can bring forward witnesses to see if we can make the bill even better than it is . 
Mr. Paul Szabo : 
Mr. Speaker , I am glad that the member raised the whistleblower aspect because it was a key issue in the Radwanski case . 
That is how Parliament was able to address that situation . 
I know that the member 's colleague in the NDP has been a very strong advocate for whistleblower legislation . 
I have a concern about whether or not the pendulum would swing too far . 
I think the member would admit that if due care was not taken in terms of whistleblower legislation , frivolous allegations could be made which might become public and which might damage the reputation or the productivity of the person the allegation was posed against . 
Is the member of the view that the whistleblower legislation has to be done carefully ? 
Should there be a review of the allegation by an independent tribunal to ensure it was not a frivolous and vexatious allegation in terms of the impact on others ? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , I agree with the hon. member . 
Frivolous accusations can destroy people 's careers . 
He is in the political world and knows very well what happens when people make frivolous accusations against politicians . 
Those allegations stick for a long time . 
We have to ensure that employees have a venue in which to be heard . 
They must have an opportunity to go to an independent third party with what they perceive to be the facts . 
We have to ensure that they know their comments will be held in private and they will not be punished in any way for bringing those allegations or concerns forward . 
We have to let them know that their allegations and concerns will be seriously investigated to ensure there is validity behind them . 
Mr. Pierre Paquette ( Joliette , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would simply like to point out that , in the debate on Bill C-46 , the Bloc Quebecois had made a certain number of proposals , in fall 2002 , following the Enron and WorldCom scandals and also our own scandal with respect to doctoring the books at CINAR . 
We had proposed tightening the Criminal Code . 
A number of the Bloc Quebecois ' proposals are now in Bill C-46 . 
We are very happy to see that , but , at the same time , we wanted to ask much broader questions . 
As I mentioned earlier in my question to the member from the NDP , it would be desirable in the follow up to Bill C-46 for a hard look to be taken at these issues , especially by the Standing Committee on Finance . 
I had already proposed that , but unfortunately , it still does not seem to top the list of priorities . 
We had also hoped that there would have been a very serious look at the use of tax havens by Canadian companies . 
We know that Barbados , for instance , a country with which the former finance minister signed a tax agreement , has become the third most popular destination for Canadian direct investments . 
We cannot say that , on the one hand , Canada will be very strict when it comes to financial practices and then , at the same time , legalize or tolerate jurisdictions that close their eyes to a number of these practices . 
Earlier I mentioned that the OECD lawyer , Mark Pieth , had suggested that the OECD member states should consider this . 
I think that this Parliament should seriously consider this over the next few months . 
The other aspect we must consider is the issue of responsible investing and measures benefiting investors and companies with responsible attitudes , not only in terms of their management practices , but also how they invest their funds . 
To this end , even if we agree in principle , Bill C-46 is at most a first step toward proper regulations on administrative practices . 
Bill C-46 contains a sticking point preventing the Bloc from voting in its favour . 
The extent of prosecution by crown prosecutors needs clarification . 
During discussions on the bill , we were told that there will be prosecution protocols . 
Clearly , we will never vote for a bill that could be a Trojan horse for an idea the federal government has long promoted , in Ottawa and Toronto , that being the implementation of a Canada-wide securities commission . 
We believe that this area comes under provincial jurisdiction , particularly in Quebec , and that our system is a good one . 
As proof , there have been no scandals , with the exception of CINAR , on the sort of scale seen in the United States , which does have a national securities commission . 
We feel that our system has worked well . 
As a result , Bill C-46 must not be used to implement any secret agenda . 
Accordingly , we will withhold our judgment until third reading . 
I wanted to speak because I thought it important to situate this debate on Bill C-46 . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) :

The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
I declare the motion lost . 
It being 6:24 p.m. , the House will now proceed to the consideration of private members ' business as listed on today 's Order Paper . 
Canada Pension Plan 
The House resumed from March 21 consideration of the motion . 
Mrs. Cheryl Gallant ( Renfrew -- Nipissing -- Pembroke , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my distinct pleasure to speak to Motion No. 197 regarding the treatment of worker 's compensation payments and consideration given to including these payments in the definition of pensionable employment within the meaning of the Canada pension plan . 
First , I would like to congratulate my parliamentary colleague from Churchill for bringing the motion forward . 
The treatment of injured workers is an issue of great importance to my riding of Renfrew -- Nipissing -- Pembroke .  So is the need to allow individuals the opportunity to accumulate the necessary savings to retire with dignity . 
The troubling aspect that the motion , by virtue of it coming forward , alludes to is the manner in which the Liberal Party administers the Canada pension plan . 
I believe I speak on behalf of members from all sides of the House when I suggest that the manner in which the Canada pension plan is administered , particularly to those individuals who through no fault of their own find it necessary to apply for CPP benefits , is done so in a callous and uncaring manner . 
Of all the casework that I deal with on behalf of my constituents in the riding of Renfrew -- Nipissing -- Pembroke , Canada pension plan cases make up the bulk of the complaints directed at the Government of Canada . 
It is a well known fact that it is not until the third appeal , after being rejected for benefits the first two times , is an application even seriously considered . 
The fact that Canadian citizens are treated so outrageously by their own government is a national scandal . 
I challenge the federal government to tell Canadians the number of applicants which are successful after a single CPP appeal , no matter how long that takes . 
I then challenge this heartless , uncaring government to tell Canadians how many people have died waiting for the benefits . 
Finally , Canadians would like to know why , if an appeal board finally grants a Canada pension , the government could not do a proper , thorough job in the first place and grant the pension when it was applied for , rather than putting individuals through the stressful process of fighting a huge , uncaring federal bureaucracy . 
I would like now to read into the record a letter that I received from a medical doctor on behalf of a constituent from the town of Renfrew , which is located near Ottawa , along the river , in my riding of Renfrew -- Nipissing -- Pembroke . 
It states : 
Dear Member of Parliament :  Mr. Constituent has made at least four attempts to the CPP tribunal board for acceptance of CPP benefits . 
He has been denied on all four attempts . 
There is sufficient evidence to support his claim that he is totally disabled . 
Once again we are writing to say that Mr. Constituent is totally disabled and has been for a period of twelve continuous months due to a re-injury of his back . 
He is unable to perform regular duties of full-time occupation for which he was employed prior to his injury date . 
Mr. Constituent is now very depressed due to lack of function and the inability to obtain any financial help . 
His wife is having to work two part-time jobs to make ends meet . 
He suffers from insomnia , as he can't shut off his mind due to financial worries . 
He has had to go on anti-depressant medication now to control this . 
I hope you can help this fellow obtain some sort of financial help . 
He is desperate . 
This individual eventually ended up on welfare , but not before he was forced to cash in all his RRSP retirement savings , which is an ironic twist to the motion we are discussing today . 
The letter I received was from his medical doctor . 
Unfortunately it is the front line medical providers who in many cases bear the frustration of a system that does not work . 
This is a real life situation that members of Parliament are called to act upon each and every day . 
I have no doubt that in the day to day responsibilities as an MP , the member for Churchill was approached by an individual whose only desire was to retire with dignity , and it was a genuine desire . 
I know the member for Churchill would agree with me , as do most reasonable Canadians , that the fair treatment of injured workers is all a question of priorities . 
The Liberal Party can find a billion dollars to waste on a useless gun registry . 
It can find billions of dollars to waste on its fat cat friends in big business in so-called forgivable loans to profitable companies that never seem to have to repay them . 
How about giving a few of these forgivable loans to the injured workers so that they can feed their families and put a roof over their heads ? 
If the government could experience the hardship it insists on inflicting on some of the more unfortunate in our society , maybe fairness would prevail . 
The expense claims of the former executive assistant to the heritage minister alone could feed a family of six in my riding for three years , as was pointed out to me by a family that is already scraping to make ends meet . 
It is all a matter of priorities . 
With the government , it is handout to friends . 
They are a greater priority than treating Canadians fairly . 
The one observation I would like to make , as a form of constructive observation , is whether reforming the CPP in the way the motion suggests is the most beneficial way of dealing with the issue of retirement benefits . 
In the province of Ontario workers ' compensation is not even available for certain classes of employment . 
In these cases the individual 's needs are provided for by private insurance companies that tailor policies to meet the specific needs of their clients . 
I believe we need to consider whether the CPP as it stands can provide the flexibility to respond to the different levels of government in different provinces which have constitutional ability in some of these areas . 
In closing , I would like to thank the member for Churchill for bringing forward her motion to allow me the opportunity to participate in the debate . 
Mr. Gérard Binet ( Frontenac -- Mégantic , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak to this motion urging the government to amend the definition of `` pensionable employment '' in the Canada Pension Plan to include worker 's compensation payments . 
I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House of some of the important provisions of the Canada Pension Plan and , in fact , of all Canadian income security programs , including the old age security program and the guaranteed income supplement . 
I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources Development , the hon. member for Shefford , explained the issue rather well during the first hour of debate on this motion . 
We are talking here about a plan , the Canada Pension Plan , but also about the Canadian income security program for the elderly , survivors and the handicapped , a plan that has been part of our heritage since 1927 when the federal government , under Mackenzie King , passed the first Old Age Pensions Act . 
Therefore , this debate should focus on the overall Canadian retirement income system , which is more than just the Canada Pension Plan . 
Contrary to what the member for Halifax suggested , the government respects the spirit of the plan , and I would even say that we have to take the old age security and the guaranteed income supplement programs as well as the Canada and the Quebec pension plans into account when we talk about the impacts on retirement income . 
Let me set the context .  The Canada pension plan was established in 1966 to guarantee a basic level of income to Canadian workers who become disabled or retire from work . 
The Canada pension plan also provides benefits to dependants of deceased contributors . 
Twelve million Canadians who work for an employer or are self-employed are covered by the Canada pension plan . 
The plan also protects migrant workers in Canada and Canadians working abroad . 
Canada pension plan retirement benefits are intended to replace about one quarter of a person 's income . 
Benefits are calculated mainly based on premiums paid and length of participation in the plan . 
The employee and the employer each pay half of the Canada pension plan premiums . 
Self-employed workers pay the whole premium . 
This is how the Canada pension plan is funded ; it is a contributory plan which takes income into account . 
The costs of the plan are covered by employees ' and employers ' contributions and by the return on investments generated by the Canada pension plan itself . 
Each month , millions of Canadians receive benefits from the Canada pension plan . 
During the 2002-03 fiscal year , 4.3 million Canadians received Canada pension plan benefits for a total of approximately $ 2.6 billion . 
During that period , the Canada pension plan paid 2.9 million Canadians a total of $ 15.1 billion in retirement benefits alone . 
In August 2003 , the maximum monthly retirement payment was $ 801 ; however , for various reasons , the majority of people do not receive that maximum . 
Pension benefits paid to Canadians average $ 455 a month . 
In this debate , we should not forget one fundamental principle ; the purpose of the Canada pension plan is to replace part of the income lost because of retirement , disability or the death of a salaried worker . 
This is why the amount provided by the Canada pension plan is based solely on employment income . 
If we depart from that principle and adopt the motion proposed by the member for Churchill , which would broaden the scope of the Canada pension plan so that workers ' compensation payments are considered pensionable income , where will we set the limits afterwards ? 
What will we do about future requests to include , as income , other forms of income support such as employment insurance or long-term disability benefits ? 
Because if we pass this motion , there will be a precedent . 
In the first hour of debate on this motion , the member for Dartmouth pointed out , and rightly so , that `` worker 's compensation is not considered pensionable employment for CPP purposes '' . 
However , she added : `` Since a retiree 's CPP eligibility is based upon months of pensionable employment , each month of work a person misses due to injury counts against them when the CPP eligibility is calculated upon retirement '' . 
She also said last March that she could not understand `` why the government has not already implemented this small but significant change to the CPP '' . 
I would like to take this opportunity to explain to the member why that is . 
It is because the legislation governing the Canada pension plan already contains provisions to exclude periods during which a worker cannot contribute to the plan . 
This means that low income months are not included in the calculation of CPP benefits and , therefore , have no negative impact on the retirement income . 
Contrary to what the hon. member has said , people will not lose retirement income because they were temporarily out of the work force due to an accident . 
The general 15 % dropout period allows people to deduct 15 % of their lowest earning years , for calculation of CPP benefits . 
Of course , one might well ask what happens when a person suffers severe and prolonged disability as the result of a work-related accident . 
What if the person is unable to make contributions ? 
The CPP legislation has a provision for persons with severe long-term disability to be eligible for CPP disability benefits , and thus their retirement income is protected . 
The CPP long-term disability program is the most important program of its type in Canada . 
In 2002-03 , CPP paid out $ 3 billion to 285,000 disabled contributors and 91,000 of their children . 
We have also made some positive tax changes for the disabled , and have helped national organizations for the disabled to strengthen their capacity and help advance an action plan for the disabled . 
In conclusion , I would like to respectfully point out one last statement by the hon. member for Dartmouth , in which she said the government `` treats injured workers as individuals who have deliberately opted out of the workforce '' . 
Nothing could be further from the truth . 
Our government believes it is important to create a wholly inclusive society . 
This means that it needs to ensure that the disabled can participate fully in the Canadian workforce . 
Our shared goal is to ensure that the disabled , including those who have become disabled in the workplace , benefit from the assistance they require in order to prepare for the job market , and to find and retain good jobs . 
This is within the context of a global skills and knowledge based economy with its challenges of competitivity . 
In order to ensure its future prosperity , Canada must benefit from the abilities and talents of all its people . 
Both our society and our economy will benefit . 
The change proposed in this motion , however , might run counter to the real needs of those it seeks to help , and might demand a major investment of new resources . 
That is why I cannot support the motion as presented . 
Mr. Sébastien Gagnon ( Lac-Saint-Jean -- Saguenay , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first I would like to thank my colleague from Frontenac -- Mégantic for reviewing the history of the system and explaning how it works . 
However , the purpose of the motion is not to question the program as a whole but rather to question its unfairness . 
Before I start , I would like to congratulate my colleague , the member for Churchill , for her initiative . 
It is a worthwhile one . 
The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of Motion M-197 .  I will read it for the benefit of those of are listening to us . 
That , in the opinion of the House , the government should amend the definition of `` pensionable employment '' in the Canada Pension Plan to include workers ' compensation payments . 
We support this motion . 
Why ? 
Because it is a matter of fairness . 
Why should victims of industrial accidents and occupational diseases be penalized when they are already penalized by negligence in the workplace , among others ? 
Why kick somebody who is already down ? 
As we know , it is already possible to exclude 15 % of the employment period as time absent from work . 
That actually does increase the average salary and , in turn , the amount of the retirement pension , as pointed out by my colleague . 
However , that is not enough . 
The situation must be corrected and , once again , I invite the federal government to follow the lead of Quebec . 
Since the 1920s , a social consensus has emerged in Quebec among employers , the state , workers as well as unions as a whole , making the employer responsible for industrial accidents . 
I would like to point out that a certain prerogative in the Quebec legislation is a determining element in the difference between what is done at the federal level and what is done in Quebec , and I quote : 
For the purpose of benefit calculation , the months included in a period where compensation is paid may be excluded from the contribution period . 
Such an exclusion must be to the advantage of the beneficiary of the benefit , i.e. increase the monthly average of pensionable earnings . 
Thus both calculations , with and without the exclusion , must be made to establish whether it is advantageous for the contributor . 
If the exclusion is favourable to the contributor , it will take effect , and the benefit will be financed in part by all contributors to the Quebec pension plan . 
Those are two major differences . 
The federal government is going after the workers , while Quebec is trying to help them . 
Which brings me to my next point . 
Why is the federal government hurting the workers instead of helping them ? 
Some would argue that this measure would incur expenses . 
Yes , it would increase social costs . 
But I would remind the House that the government has built up a $ 45 billion surplus in the EI account at the expense of the workers . 
Why not decrease EI premiums to avoid such unfairness ? 
This is a very simple solution that would bring us closer to a compromise and address the concerns of EI contributors as well as Canada pension plan contributors . 
If the federal government were sensitive to workers , it would try to eliminate such inequities in Canada . 
But this is not the only inequity . 
Let me give you some examples . 
The Saguenay -- Lac-Saint-Jean area is faced with some serious problems . 
Our young people are moving away , we are dealing with the softwood lumber issue , there are few jobs and businesses are closing down . 
Let us talk about employment insurance , another program that affects workers . 
Graduating students in the tourism or hotel industry who would like to lend a hand to the tourist industry in the regions cannot afford to take seasonal jobs , since they need to work 900 hours to qualify for EI . 
This is a serious inequity that has to be dealt with for our region to develop , stand out and increase its tourism productivity on a yearly basis . 
We have the same problems with the lumber workers . 
Again , these workers never wished for this lumber crisis . 
There are caught in the middle of a crisis involving two partners , the United States and Canada . 
But it must be understood that the federal government has the power to intervene to help these workers . 
And yet it is not doing so . 
The Bloc Quebecois has suggested to the federal government that it give loan guarantees to businesses so they can turn to secondary and tertiary processing , thus allowing industry to find other markets . 
We talked about businesses . 
Now let us talk about workers . 
The federal government could very well have helped workers between seasons by increasing the benefit period , but it did not do so . 
It could also have eliminated the two-week waiting period . 
This is a two-week period during which the worker does not receive any benefits . 
But it does not want to do that either . 
And there is another injustice in the fact that it did so for workers who were affected by the SARS crisis in Toronto . 
This is unacceptable . 
Why do it in one region and not in another ? 
There is another problem . 
Just recently , national unions released statistics , and I will refer here to another group that has been hard hit in our region , namely women . 
In 1996 , 48 % of women received employment insurance benefits . 
Today , that percentage has dropped to 36 % . 
Who instigated these drastic measures ? 
The former Minister of Finance , the future prime minister . 
I would like to give another example of an injustice suffered by the workers . 
My colleague , the member for Laurentides , and myself are currently promoting an anti-scab bill . 
This bill is important for workers across Canada . 
Indeed , there is a major difference between those workers who are governed by the Quebec labour code and those who are governed by the Canada Labour Code . 
Right now , in Canada , it is possible for businesses to hire replacement workers . 
In Quebec , we heard some witnesses , including those who spoke about the labour dispute at Cargill , in Baie-Comeau , which lasted three years . 
The federal government does not even want to recognize this , yet there is no cost attached . 
It is only a question of political will . 
According to the data , in Quebec , a labour dispute is solved twice as quickly as in Canada . 
The data is there , the benefits are there . 
Consequently , why is the federal government refusing to help workers ? 
Such a measure has been in existence in Quebec since 1977 . 
It was implemented when René Lévesque was in office . 
We have solved most labour disputes . 
I come back to my colleague . 
You know that , in Saguenay -- Lac-Saint-Jean , there are four members of Parliament . 
Three are in the Bloc Quebecois and one is in the government party . 
Unfortunately , he cannot express his views . 
Yet , we have the same workers , the same problems in the area , but this member is muzzled by his government , by the interests of the party in power . 
This is unfortunate . 
For the sake of justice , why would the government not have these people benefit from an appropriate pension plan , instead of penalizing people who are at an age where they should be thinking about retiring securely . 
These people have worked hard all their lives . 
The government , by using as an excuse a problem or an illness that that hits them at the age of 60 , for example , would penalize them in their pension plan . 
But I believe and I am convinced that they rightly deserve this pension . 
Simply for the sake of justice , let us show sensitivity to all these workers , let us provide them with all the dignity that they deserve . 
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin -- Swan River , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party to take part in the debate on Motion No. 197 , which would make workers ' compensation payments pensionable employment for CPP . 
I want to congratulate the member for Churchill for putting forth this motion . 
The issue is really about injured workers being prevented from contributing to CPP while collecting workman 's compensation . 
Let me begin by enunciating the arguments in support of the motion as presented . 
Allowing workers to continue making CPP contributions while injured most likely would result in larger CPP benefits upon retirement . 
After all , it is income . 
Another argument is that because CPP is calculated based on the number of months of pensionable employment , workers who are injured for significant periods of time receive significantly reduced CPP benefits upon retirement . 
Certainly this is a concern for a lot of workers , especially when people have been off work not for six months but for upwards of three to five years . 
The important issue here to recognize that it is income ; it is income not because workers do not want to work but because they are not able to work . 
The system really needs to treat this income from an income perspective and from a pensionable perspective as well . 
The 15 % dropout period in the CPP , which allows workers to exclude 15 % of their working months from CPP calculations , is not adequate for workers who suffer severe injuries that require lengthy rehabilitation . 
In Quebec , injured workers receive benefits through the CSST , the Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail . 
That allows them to continue making contributions toward the Quebec pension plan . 
Another argument in support of the motion is that in the federal public service pension plan workers who are absent due to injury or illness are able to , upon return to the workplace , make pension contributions retroactively in order to keep an unbroken record of pensionable service . 
That sounds pretty reasonable to me . 
With a rapidly aging population , Canada is faced with the challenge of ensuring that its senior citizens are able to live out their retirement years in dignity . 
Because we are talking about pensions , recent studies indicate that approximately 70 % of elderly Canadians are dependent on public pension plans . 
Progressive Conservatives have always viewed the CPP as a fundamental part of the Canadian social safety net , an obligation that governments must honour . 
In 1997 Ottawa and the provinces agreed to two major changes to the CPP . 
First , CPP funds were to be invested in the marketplace and managed by an arm 's length agency , the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board . 
The legislation creating the board was criticized for creating a weak governance structure without sufficient checks and balances . 
Second , premiums were to be increased more rapidly than previously planned , but capped at 9.95 % , the level needed to fund the plan over the long run . 
By 2003 this equalled an $ 11 billion increase in annual premium revenues . 
Policies must also be developed to enable a greater number of Canadian seniors in need of caregiving to remain in their own homes rather than in more expensive institutional accommodations where their independence suffers . 
A Progressive Conservative government would double the $ 800 value of the tax credit currently given to Canadians who care for low income elderly parents , grandparents or infirm relatives in their homes . 
In addition to that , a Progressive Conservative government would not raise CPP contribution rates beyond adequate levels to ensure the long term viability of the plan . 
A Progressive Conservative government would require that members of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board have pension fund or investment expertise . 
We would appoint a minister of state for seniors to ensure that the unique needs of seniors were properly addressed across government departments . 
We would appoint the Auditor General as the auditor of the CPP Investment Board . 
A Progressive Conservative government would redirect resources from within the existing budget of Human Resources Development Canada to process the current backlog of Canada pension plan disability applications . 
In 2000 the Liberal government announced an increase in the caregiver tax credit amount from $ 2,386 to $ 3,500 for the 2001 tax year . 
The Canada pension plan is financially sound and on track to provide retirement pensions in the future . 
This was the announcement made by federal and provincial ministers of finance on February 9 , 2003 , following the conclusion of their financial review of the Canada pension plan . 
As joint stewards of the Canada pension plan , ministers of finance are required by legislation to review the plan 's long term financial health every three years . 
In their latest review , they agreed that no changes to benefits or the contribution rates are required . 
The 9.95 % contribution rate should be sufficient to sustain the plan indefinitely . 
On February 28 , 2003 , the member for Cumberland -- Colchester , the PC critic for the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency , presented a private member 's bill that would see no application for the disability tax credit denied without it first being reviewed by a qualified medical practitioner . 
Reducing the debt ratio will free up resources that will also give governments greater freedom to respond to future pressures . 
For example , the federal government will face pressures from an aging population , either directly through seniors ' benefits or indirectly through demands from the provinces to increase transfers for health care . 
According to David Zussman , president of Public Policy Forum , as printed in the Ottawa Citizen on November 25 , 2002 , currently seniors ' benefits represent 2.3 % of the GDP and are projected to rise to 4.7 % of the GDP by 2040 . 
There are many other ways the government could ensure that we do not waste money so that there is more money for the CPP , for example , the failed long gun registry , which is into its second billion , and advertising contracts that we talked about in the House . 
The Privacy Commissioner 's waste of public tax dollars is another example . 
So there are many ways of finding resources to fund the Canada pension plan . 
In closing , I want to look at some of the arguments against the motion . 
First , disability benefits within the Canada pension plan already exist for people who are disabled on the job . 
Second , if we include workers compensation as income , where do we draw the line ? 
That question is often raised . 
What about employment insurance , CPP disability income , social assistance and other forms of income ? 
It is unfair to collect CPP premiums from people already facing a reduced income by way of workers compensation . 
However , if premiums were not collected to cover the increase in CPP benefits upon retirement , the CPP liability would increase . 
Another question often raised is , who would pay the employer 's half of the CPP premium for an injured worker ? 
That is quite common . 
The last comment I have is that the 15 % drop out period already exists as a provision for workplace absences . 
There are pros and cons in this debate . 
I have presented them this evening on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville -- Musquodoboit Valley -- Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , unlike my Progressive Conservative colleague , I would like to state that an NDP government , and that has a wonderful sound to it , would ensure that a motion of this nature , which , next to some of the motions I have presented , is one of the finest pieces of legislation to hit the floor of the House of Commons , is passed . 
My colleague from Churchill should be congratulated for her efforts on behalf of injured workers throughout the entire country . 
Anyone who has ever dealt with workman 's compensation , whether they live in the three territorial jurisdictions or the ten provinces , knows what a quagmire it can be . 
It is an absolute bureaucratic mess . 
All the member is doing is ensuring matters for people who are injured on the job . 
We know the statistics . 
Every day in Canada three people die on the job and hundreds are injured ; they should not be punished in their long term retirement plans by deductions of CPP . 
It naturally should be included . 
As my colleague from Dauphin -- Swan River said , it is part of a person 's income and should be considered as such when it comes to retirement benefits such as CPP . 
We know , of course , that this is a good motion . 
It is good for workers and good for their families , so the Liberals must be against it then , but what is new about that ? 
They have voted against every positive resolution we have ever presented . 
This is a pragmatic motion . 
We know there is a problem and we know the motion will address that problem . 
Does it address all the problems ? 
No , nor was the member indicating it would . 
This is just one small step toward fixing the problems . 
I know of what the member speaks . 
Five years ago , I presented Bill C-206 , the caregivers ' legislation , which , basically and briefly , stated as an example that if my wife and I had a child and we were both working , either one of us could take a year off work and get unemployment insurance , through maternity benefits or paternity benefits . 
However , what happens if the doctor diagnoses our seven year old child with cancer and says our child had six months to live ? 
What are we supposed to do ? 
I ask members to ask themselves what they as parents would do . 
Would they institutionalize the child ? 
Would they take time off work ? 
Would their company allow them to take time off work ? 
Would they suffer a financial loss because of it ? 
All of these questions go through the minds of Canadians every day . 
All my bill said was that if a physician stated that someone has a relative under palliative care , the caregiver should be able to take time off work to prevent that person from being institutionalized . 
The bill stated that the caregiver should be able to collect unemployment insurance for up to one year , like maternity benefits , which would allow the caregiver to have job security , flexibility and an income while caring for that person . 
For every dollar spent through the EI system , $ 4 would be saved in the health care system . 
Those are facts , right there on pages 184 to 188 of the Romanow report . 
The Liberals were against that but they did introduce a program , a very small one , a starter step , starting in January , for six weeks for children . 
I will give them credit for that . 
However , I will come back to my colleague from Churchill , Manitoba , the polar bear capital of the world , by the way . 
My colleague states very clearly that there is a need for this type of legislation . 
I know the member quite well . 
She does not throw out legislation willy-nilly just to have a conversation and tie up this full House we have tonight , standing room only of course . 
She thought this over very carefully . 
She has worked with various groups , organizations and individuals who have gone through this . 
She , being a good member of Parliament and a fine representative of her beautiful area of northern Manitoba , has said very clearly that she would like to introduce this into legislation . 
It has some merit , because the committee that deals with private members ' business has made it a votable item . 
The committee of her peers is not made up of fools . 
They are good people from all the respective political parties . 
They know the motion has merit . 
We are rather ashamed that the Liberals are against it , but we have not spoken to every one of them . 
Hopefully we can change their minds and work toward this motion being passed . 
No injured worker under any circumstance should have to suffer when it comes to CPP . 
We in the NDP have always stated that a pension plan is a cornerstone to retirement . 
Although the Canada pension plan has not done everything that we would like it to , it has prevented an awful lot of people from slipping into dire straits . 
The public pension plan is a very good idea . 
In fact , it is a social democratic idea . 
It was people like Stanley Knowles , M.J. Caldwell and J.S. Woodsworth , and the pages are looking at me wondering who were those great people . 
They were the founders of our party . 
They were the ones who fought for health care .  They were the ones who fought for pensions , long before it was ever cool to talk about these things . 
They knew the need was out there . 
If it were not for those great people , we would not have those things today . 
The New Democratic Party , and previously the CCF , has done terrific work . 
Although we have never formed a federal government , one day I hope I to sit in this House as a member of an NDP government . 
The reality is that this is the type of legislation people would see from a very progressive government , a social democratic government . 
Public health , public education , a publicly funded military , a publicly funded police force , a publicly funded system of roads and transportation are all social democratic ideas . 
We are very pleased when opposition parties right of centre , and the Liberals are the right of centre of party now , actually support some of those initiatives . 
They grew up in this country under those programs . 
Those programs were fought for by members of the New Democratic Party as well as many people in the social movement . 
Union members have died for these types of rights . 
If I can give the union movement a plug right now , if it were not for the unions , we would not have the concept known as the weekend . 
Having said that , this is a fine piece of legislation . 
It is worthy of further debate . 
It should go to committee so we can have a more constructive debate and dialogue on it . 
There are those who would oppose it in any way through lack of information , lack of knowledge or maybe they just do not like it . 
Maybe we can change their minds to vote for something to help injured workers in this country in their retirement plans . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
It being 7:09 p.m. , pursuant to order made earlier this day , all questions necessary to dispose of Motion M-197 are deemed put and a recorded division is deemed demanded and deferred until Tuesday , October 21 , 2003 , at the expiry of the time provided for government orders . 
ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS 
A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved . 
National Defence 
Mrs. Cheryl Gallant ( Renfrew -- Nipissing -- Pembroke , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as the member of Parliament for Renfrew -- Nipissing -- Pembroke which includes Base Petawawa , I am honoured to fill my role in defending the brave men and women who serve in the Canadian armed forces from the actions of a callous uncaring government . 
I want the military community in Canada , and particularly the families of each and every member who is part of Operation Athena , the current deployment to Afghanistan , to know that I will honour the deaths of their fallen comrades by holding the government accountable , particularly the Minister of National Defence , for their unnecessary and tragic deaths . 
The Minister of National Defence is hiding in his statements when he says now is not the time to raise these questions . 
When it comes to the safety of our troops , now is always the right time . 
Time and again the Minister of National Defence has demonstrated an absolute callous disregard for the safety of our soldiers . 
This was done when the minister ordered Canadian Forces logistics personnel in Afghanistan to give up their weapons .  It was done when the decision was made not to provide proper arid uniforms .  It was done when the decision was made not to provide the ballistic plates for the fragmentation protection vests until they were forced to . 
And now it has been done with ordering Canadian soldiers to patrol in a combat zone in the Iltis jeep that affords no protection to its occupants from landmines . 
The defence minister knew he was sending Canadian soldiers to their deaths when he went around making the statement `` expect casualties '' . 
The minister would not have been making that statement if he did not believe it . 
He was telling the families of our soldiers to expect casualties because he knew that the deaths were inevitable , given the state of some of the old equipment soldiers are expected to make do with . 
Pre-announcing casualties was part of an elaborate PR campaign to try to deflect criticism when bodies started to be shipped home . 
If the minister spent as much time securing equipment for our troops as he does as an apologist for our old helicopters and leaky second-hand subs , our soldiers would have the equipment they need . 
With a defence minister who is a pre-eminent armchair warrior , I know that he wants to deny the facts . 
The truth is , if our soldiers had the equipment they need , they would be alive today . 
Former U.S. ground commander Colonel Frank Wiercinski warned Canada that the Iltis jeep was a death trap for any soldier using it in Afghanistan . 
For Canadians who are unaware , the Iltis is a 25 year old vehicle based on a Volkswagen which at the time was built under contract by the perennial Liberal Party financial donor , Bombardier . 
To the credit of our allies the Americans , they told the Minister of National Defence to leave the Iltis jeep at home when the 3rd Battalion of the Princess Patricia 's Canadian Light Infantry were deployed to Afghanistan last year . 
Knowing that Canada is short of having the proper equipment , the Americans insisted on supplying armoured Humvees that provide some element of protection for the occupants from landmines . 
It is said that history repeats itself . 
We have a defence minister who is a modern day equivalent to Sam Hughes of World War I fame . 
The decision to provide our soldiers with a rifle that jammed more often than it was fired because it was provided by a `` friend of the party '' is still remembered by legions across Canada today . 
Helicopters , jeeps , leaky subs , we can take our pick . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence has four minutes to answer . 
Mr. Dominic LeBlanc ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thought that adjournment proceedings were to focus on questions that in the opinion of the member were not answered properly when they were first posed . 
This question was asked by the member for Renfrew -- Nipissing -- Pembroke on May 9 . 
However in her comments she chose to add a series of rather exaggerated and outrageous statements , but I will follow what I thought was the procedure and try to clarify for her , as we have many times . 
The hon. member 's question related to the theatre activation team that was deployed in April 2003 and was not permitted to carry weapons without the proper authorization given by the ISAF commander . 
This did not solely apply to the Canadian Forces but also to NATO 's own reconnaissance team . 
The responsibility to provide for the theatre activation team 's security rested with ISAF . 
Our advance team elements were protected at all times . 
That being said , it is important perhaps to remind the House and Canadians that it has never been more needed than to have Canadian participation to secure and rebuild Afghanistan . 
There are people who oppose the international community 's efforts in Afghanistan and who will try to dissuade us from our mission . 
The Canadian Forces will neither retreat from their mission nor will we retreat from our international responsibilities . 
The government and Canadians are fully committed to our mission in Afghanistan . 
The operation in Afghanistan is part of Canada 's broader commitment to the worldwide campaign against terrorism . 
The member referred to some of the tragic events of late last week and I think it would be important to paraphrase what Lieutenant-General Hillier said at this week 's memorial service for our fallen soldiers . 
He said , `` soldiers are tangible expressions of our nation 's beliefs and extend our values and ideals worldwide '' . 
I know that I speak for everyone when I say the professionalism and expertise of the Canadian Forces is also renowned worldwide . 
They are remarkable ambassadors and promoters of Canadian values and they are making us proud in Afghanistan . 
The House can rest assured that the priority of both the Canadian Forces and the government is always the security of our soldiers . 
This is certainly the case as the Canadian Forces prepared for their deployment last spring to Afghanistan . 
Every effort was made in the planning of our mission to provide for the safety of the troops and to ensure the success of the mission . 
That is exactly why we are providing our troops in Afghanistan with excellent equipment , such as remotely piloted aircraft that allow Kabul to be surveyed from the air , counter-bombardment radars , which detect incoming projectiles and new night vision equipment . 
Not only are our troops properly equipped for their mission but they have also received the best training possible . 
It is simply not accurate , or I find very responsible , to pretend that our troops were not secure when they were in Afghanistan last April , nor are they protected as they carry out their important mission there today . 
Mrs. Cheryl Gallant : 
Mr. Speaker , the government just does not get it . 
It keeps on passing the buck . 
The drones are not yet there flying and the night vision goggles still fog up . 
When it comes to the men and women who serve in our armed forces , in the eyes of this government they are nothing more than second class citizens . 
When the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment was deployed to Afghanistan the Minister of National Defence promised that `` No no effort and no money will be spared to protect Canadian Forces '' . 
More important , the Minister of National Defence made a promise to the people of Canada . 
In an interview with Craig Oliver he promised that he would resign if any Canadians died because they did not have the right equipment . 
It is time for that promise to be kept . 
A man of honour would do the right thing . 
The right thing is to step aside for a full , independent , public and complete investigation . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
The parliamentary secretary has one minute to conclude this debate . 
Mr. Dominic LeBlanc : 
Mr. Speaker , as usual the member is full of rather dramatic exaggerations . 
It is in fact her goggles that are fogged up , not the night vision goggles that are there . 
She talked about the Iltis jeep . 
General Leslie was on a patrol in Kabul in an Iltis jeep last Friday . 
To pretend that somehow this tragedy could have been avoided with different equipment is simply not borne out by the facts , and it is rather irresponsible for the member to make outrageous statements . 
She said that the minister pre-announced casualties and sent these soldiers to their deaths . 
That is disgraceful to ascribe that kind of comment to the Minister of National Defence and she should be ashamed of herself . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted . 
Accordingly , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24(1) .

37th PARLIAMENT , 2nd SESSION EDITED HANSARD -- NUMBER 137 
OFFICIAL REPORT ( HANSARD ) 
Thursday , October 9 , 2003 Speaker : The Honourable Peter Milliken 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Prayers 
Privilege 
Bill C-13 -- Speaker 's Ruling 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
I will now give the ruling on the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Mississauga South on October 6 . 
I thank the hon. member for raising the question , as well as the hon. member for Yellowhead for his comments . 
The hon. member for Mississauga South argued that , in light of the complexity of the bill and of the number of amendments which the House had adopted at report stage , members required a reprint of the bill in order to be able to properly conduct debate at third reading . 
He pointed out that this need was all the more pressing given that the bill had not been debated since April 10 of this year . 
The unanimous consent of the House was sought on March 31 and again on October 3 to permit a motion ordering a reprint of the bill to be put to a vote . 
The consent was denied . 
I would like to remind the hon. member that it is not the practice of the House to have bills reprinted at third reading . 
In this regard I refer him to the ruling by the Deputy Speaker on the same point concerning Bill C-13 on March 31 , at page 4922 of the Debates . 
As the hon. member is fully aware , the House may , if it chooses , order a reprint of the bill . 
The unanimous consent necessary to allow such a motion to be put without notice has so far not been forthcoming . 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I welcome and accept the ruling of the Chair on the question of privilege . 
I would simply indicate that it would be my intent to make recommendations to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs , with possible reference to a future modernization committee , on the point simply that denial of unanimous consent for a reprint in matters such as this would not be unreasonably withheld . 
Routine Proceedings 
Committees of the House 
National Defence and Veteran Affairs 
Mr. David Pratt ( Nepean -- Carleton , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the fourth report of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veteran Affairs . 
Pursuant to the order of reference of Friday , September 26 , 2003 , your committee considered and held hearings on Bill C-37 , an act to amend the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts , and agreed on Tuesday , October 7 , 2003 , to report it without amendment . 
Procedure and House Affairs 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present the 47th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding the associate membership of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates . 
If the House gives its consent I intend to move concurrence in the 47th report later this day . 
Overseas Memorial Sites Student Visits Act 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville -- Musquodoboit Valley -- Eastern Shore , NDP ) 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-455 , an act to provide for a program giving financial assistance to high school students visiting overseas military memorial sites . 
He said : Mr. Speaker , I wish to thank my seconder from Windsor -- St. Clair and the person from Brandon -- Souris who wanted to triple the bill . 
The bill would allow the government to simply look at a program , to work with the provinces , the school boards and various veterans organizations , such as the Royal Canadian Legion , et cetera , to see if it is possible to encourage and financially assist high school students , some time during their high school year , to visit an overseas military site . 
For those who were at Juno Beach for the opening on June 6 of this year , it was an extremely moving event to be with 900 veterans and their families . 
The reality is that many Canadian young people simply do not have a complete understanding of what our soldiers and their families went through during our various wars and conflicts . 
I think this would be a great way to assist those young people in acquiring a better understanding of what our most hallowed veterans and their families went through during those times of crises and it could lead to everlasting peace throughout this world . 
( Motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
Excise Tax Act 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) 
moved to introduce Bill C-456 , an act to amend the Excise Tax Act . 
She said : Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased today to introduce a bill whose purpose is to amend the Excise Tax Act so that disposable and fabric diapers are exempted from the GST . 
I think that it is totally unacceptable that children 's diapers should be taxed , as this is an essential need for families , children and also for parents . 
I believe that this measure can help families in a concrete way . 
I invite all my colleagues to support this bill . 
( Motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
Committees of the House 
Procedure and House Affairs 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I move that the 47th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs , presented to the House earlier today , be concurred in . 
( Motion agreed to ) 
Petitions 
Health 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon -- Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to present two petitions on behalf of my constituents of Brandon -- Souris . 
The first petition asks that medical expenses be a tax credit . 
They wish Parliament to take the necessary steps to change the Income Tax Act to allow receipts for vitamins and supplements to be used as medical expenses in personal income tax returns and again have them GST exempt . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon -- Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition , again on behalf of the constituents of Brandon -- Souris , is also with respect to their right to making informed choices and having access to non-drug medicinal products of their own choosing . 
They wish to provide Canadians with greater access to non-drug preventive and medicinal options . 
I present both of these petitions to the House . 
Marriage 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I present a petition on behalf of the citizens of the Peterborough area who point out that marriage is a unique social institution that provides a supporting relationship between a woman and a man and that marriage is an institution so basic to the human condition and the common good that its nature is beyond the reach of civil law . 
They call upon Parliament to take all necessary means to maintain and support this definition of marriage in Canada . 
Stem Cell Research 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have two brief petitions today . 
The first is on the subject matter of stem cells . 
Petitioners from across Canada , including my own riding of Mississauga South , would like to draw to the attention of the House that Canadians do support ethical stem cell research , which has already shown encouraging potential to provide cures and therapies for illnesses and diseases . 
They also want to point out that non-embryonic stem cells , also known as adult stem cells , have shown significant research progress without the immune rejection or ethical problems associated with embryonic stem cells . 
The petitioners therefore pray upon Parliament to focus its legislative support on adult stem cell research to find those necessary cures and therapies . 
Marriage 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition is in regard to same sex marriage . 
The petitioners would like to remind the House that on June 10 the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that the definition of marriage was unconstitutional pursuant to the equality provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
The petitioners also remind the House , however , that the federal government can invoke the notwithstanding clause to override that decision . 
The petitioners therefore call upon Parliament to invoke the notwithstanding clause , thereby retaining the traditional definition of marriage as being the legal union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
Search and Rescue 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta -- South Richmond , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition from the Wreck Beach community , friends and visitors in Vancouver . 
There are over 700 signatures on the petition . 
The petitioners call on Parliament to bring to the attention of the government the folly of purchasing a 20 year old British hovercraft as a replacement for the 045 Hovercraft at Sea Island base in Vancouver . 
They call upon Parliament to direct the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to purchase a new hovercraft , a vessel that would be capable of doing the medical evacuations that are sometimes required and capable also of serving as an adequate dive platform for the Coast Guard dive team . 
Foreign Affairs 
Ms. Nancy Karetak-Lindell ( Nunavut , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I present this petition on behalf of my colleague , the member for Western Arctic . 
It states that in the event the Government of Canada may be asked to support the U.S. national missile defence program to be operated by North American Aerospace Defence Command , this might be a step toward deployment of weapons in space and lead to a new arms race . 
Also , the international non-proliferation treaty and the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty were cornerstones of the arms control and disarmament regimes and have been long supported by Canada . 
The petitioners call upon Parliament to declare that Canada objects to the national missile defence program of the United States and also to play a leadership role in banning nuclear weapons and missile flight tests . 
Questions on the Order Paper 
Mr. Rodger Cuzner ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all questions be allowed to stand . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
Is that agreed ? 
Some hon. members : Agreed . 
Points of Order 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Earlier during routine proceedings the chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs tabled a report from the committee and then , under motions , sought concurrence for that report . 
I would like some clarification from the House as to whether or not the motion to concur in the report is debatable and , if so , why the Chair does not call for debate prior to asking for unanimous consent . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
To answer your query , in theory a motion of this kind is debatable but in practice it has not been the case for many years . 
I do not know if the member would like to pursue the matter with the hon. member for Peterborough in order to get the explanation he is looking for . 
Mr. Paul Szabo : 
Mr. Speaker , I raised the issue and it is important . 
I will pursue it , possibly again with the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs or others who may have some impact on the Standing Orders . 
I would remind hon. members that such a report and such a concurrence motion without debate was one of the reasons why the Lord 's Prayer was eliminated from the routine of this place without the knowledge of members of the House , so I will be pursuing it . 
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
Income Tax Act 
Hon. Denis Coderre ( for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance ) 
moved that Bill C-48 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act ( natural resources ) , be read the third time and passed . 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the legislation before us , Bill C-48 , implements a new federal income tax structure for Canada 's resource sector , to be phased in over five years . 
To begin , I want to give the House a sense of the overall importance of the resource sector , especially mining and oil and gas , to the Canadian economy as a generator of investment , exports and jobs for Canadians . 
In 2001 , for example , the sector accounted for almost 4 % of Canada 's GDP , with over $ 64 billion in exports and more than $ 30 billion in capital expenditures . 
As well , over 170,000 Canadians work in resource businesses . 
The potential for future resource development exists right across the country . 
While the mining industry is vital to rural and northern economies , the oil and gas industry is important to both the western and Atlantic provinces and the territories . 
Internationally , Canadian resource industries are large investors in innovative technology and they also play a significant role in the provision of exploration and extraction services . 
Overall , the changes in Bill C-48 will be positive , both for mining and for the oil and gas industry , but before discussing them , I want to briefly review the existing sector specific tax measures . 
As hon. members know , income earned in Canada from the extraction and initial processing of non-renewable resources has historically been subject to a range of targeted tax measures . 
For example , certain provisions determine the timing of deductions for capital expenditures .  They include Canadian exploration expenses , Canadian development expenses , Canadian oil and gas property expenses and capital cost allowances . 
These measures recognize the risks involved in investing in resource exploration and extraction and also play an important role in ensuring a competitive business environment . 
In addition , the resource sector is able to use flowthrough shares to raise capital for resource exploration and development . 
Individuals investing in flowthrough shares for grassroots mineral exploration are also eligible for the 15 % mineral exploration tax credit , introduced in October 2000 as a temporary measure to moderate the impact of the global downturn in exploration activity on mining communities across Canada . 
Another resource specific provision is the 25 % resource allowance .  This provision was introduced in 1976 primarily to protect the federal income tax base from what were rapidly increasing provincial royalties and mining taxes , which had been deductible for federal tax purposes . 
The resource allowance , however , is an arbitrary deduction that does not necessarily reflect the actual cost of royalties and mining taxes . 
Consequently , it can distort the returns from individual resource projects and the allocation of investment between projects within the resource sector and between the resource sector and other parts of the economy . 
As well , the complexity of the resource allowance calculation has meant substantial compliance costs for the industry and administrative costs for government . 
The economic conditions that led to the introduction of the resource allowance have changed significantly since the 1970s , leaving the original need for it less relevant . 
In today 's economic environment , there is greater pressure on producers to be efficient and on host jurisdictions to levy royalties at competitive rates . 
The government recognized that the resource sector tax regime is capable of generating even greater investment and jobs for Canadians . 
In designing a new tax regime for the sector , the government was guided by three main goals . 
First , the tax regime must be internationally competitive , particularly in the North American market . 
Second , it must be transparent for firms and investors . 
Third , it must promote the efficient allocation of investment both within the resource sector and between sectors of the Canadian economy . 
Following extensive consultations with the industry , and I underline extensive , the government announced in the 2003 budget that it intended to improve the taxation of resource income . 
Subsequently , on March 3 the Minister of Finance released a technical paper on the budget proposals . 
These proposals were reviewed in the course of extensive consultation with the industry and with the provinces .  In response to these consultations , some special transition measures were incorporated into the legislation before the House today . 
I would now like to briefly review the measures in Bill C-48 . 
The proposed new tax structure will ensure that the resource sector firms are subject to the same statutory rate of corporate income tax as firms in other sectors . 
It will also ensure that these firms can deduct their actual cost of production rather than an arbitrary allowance . 
Let me explain a little further . 
The first measure in Bill C-48 would reduce the federal statutory corporate income tax rate on income earned from resource activities from 28 % to 21 % by 2007 . 
This rate is often the first piece of information viewed by prospective investors . 
If Canada is to send a positive message to investors that it is competitive , then this uniform lower rate is indeed essential . 
The second measure would eliminate the arbitrary 25 % resource allowance and would provide a deduction for the actual amount of provincial and other crown royalties and mining taxes paid . 
This means that projects would now be treated in a more comparable fashion . 
This change would promote efficiency by ensuring that the investment decisions were based more consistently on the underlying economics of each project . 
It would also result in a simpler tax structure , streamlining tax administration and compliance . 
The government has recognized the particular circumstances of the mining sector in Bill C-48 by proposing a new 10 % mineral exploration tax credit and it will apply to both Canadian grassroots exploration and preproduction development exploration for diamonds , base or precious metals and industrial minerals that become base or precious metals through refining . 
It is proposed that these new measures be phased in over a five year transition period .  An exception is the new mineral exploration credit which will reach its full rate in only three years . 
The proposed implementation schedule provides a reasonable transition to an improved tax structure in a fiscally responsible manner . 
In addition to the resource tax changes , Bill C-48 includes measures that promote renewable energy and energy conservation projects by improving the treatment of Canadian renewable and conservation expenses , the CRCE . 
These expenses are fully deductible in the year that they are incurred and can be transferred to investors under a flow-through share agreement . 
As I clarified in the standing committee hearings , we are discussing federal tax changes only . 
To the extent that the provinces rely on the federal tax base though , if offsetting adjustments are not made , provincial income tax revenue from the resource sector may increase as a result of these changes . 
The international competitiveness of Canadian firms will be maximized where provinces provide a mechanism to return to the industry any provincial revenue gain arising from the changes to the federal tax structure . 
The new tax structure for the resource sector complements other measures in the 2003 budget .  We discussed these measures during the debate last spring on Bill C-28 , the Budget Implementation Act , 2003 . 
That bill eliminated the federal capital tax over five years , which will strengthen the Canadian tax advantage for investment in the capital-intensive resource sector . 
Together with the elimination of the federal capital tax , the new measures in the bill we are considering today will substantially reduce the effective tax rates , both for the mining and the oil and gas industries . 
For oil and gas , this reverses a current disadvantage relative to the United States . 
For mining it will build on an existing advantage . 
In both cases the changes place the Canadian resource sector in a markedly improved position to attract capital for exploration and development . 
Bill C-48 reflects the government 's ongoing commitment to an efficient and competitive corporate income tax system which plays an important role in creating a stronger and more productive economy . 
The resource sector attaches considerable priority to the delivery of these proposed changes . 
I cannot emphasize that enough for the members . 
During the finance committee hearings on Bill C-48 , the industry representatives and many committee members indicated that they considered the timely delivery of the legislation to be of utmost importance to their constituents and , indeed , to many provinces such as Alberta , Saskatchewan , Nova Scotia , et cetera . 
Given the benefits of these changes for the resource industries and the communities on which they depend , I would encourage all hon. members to give quick and speedy passage to Bill C-48 . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have two questions . 
Why did it take three years for the government to finally understand the logic of tax equity ? 
Why did it take between the budget of 2000 and the budget of 2003 for the government to finally realize one very simple principle : that we ought not to discriminate against particular sectors of the economy , in this case the energy sector ? 
Why the delay ? 
Second , why will it now take five years from this point to create equity for the men and women who work in the oil and gas , mining and forestry sectors of Canada ? 
There is an eight year gap between the general reduction in corporate taxes in 2000 and the full implementation of the changes to non-mineral resource taxation . 
What can possibly account for that ? 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert : 
Mr. Speaker , I would have expected the member to get up and actually praise the fact that the government has brought in Bill C-48 and that we are now ensuring that we have a competitive tax regime for the mining and the oil and gas sector . 
Clearly , we want to ensure on this side of the House that when we bring in legislation , we do it with the full support and concurrence of the major stakeholders , whether they be in the resource sector or with the provinces . 
The hon. member also knows that the government has been a leader in not only eliminating the deficit and paying down the national debt , but also ensuring that we have the necessary dollars to do these things and that we do not go back into a deficit . 
We have had now six balanced budgets or better . 
Rome was not built in a day . 
Obviously we are responding to the industry , to the provinces and we are doing it in what I believe is a timely fashion . 
We are implementing a phase-in over a five year period , again in concert with the consultations that we have had . 
I would assume , the member being from the province of Alberta which is obviously very supportive of this , that we can expect his support on this legislation . 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , that response was completely disingenuous . 
I have enough respect for the parliamentary secretary to know that he knows it is disingenuous to suggest that it will take the government eight years from the lowering of general corporate tax rates in 2000 to bring about full equity for the non-mineral resource sector because it wanted to consult `` with the stakeholders '' . 
In other words , the parliamentary secretary is trying to tell us that oil and gas companies were asking the government to do this as slowly as possible , that these companies , which are responsible for hundreds of thousands of jobs in our economy , asked the government to please let them consult over three years about whether they would ever get the tax equity with other corporations and that it should please take five years after that to implement it . 
This is utterly ridiculous . 
The other reason the member alluded to for the eight year delay in tax equity for this important sector was that it was necessary to do things in the context of fiscal responsibility . 
Once fully implemented the total static forgone revenue projection for this tax change will be $ 260 million a year . 
If I am not mistaken , that is about as much as the cabinet decided to spend on new jets . 
Where are the priorities ? 
If it is really about fiscal responsibility , why not cut the parties of the Minister of Canadian Heritage at Whistler and across the country ? 
Why not put the jets on hold ? 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert : 
Mr. Speaker , was that a question or an editorial comment ? 
I assume the member is supportive of the fact of a reduction from 28 % to 21 % by 2007 . 
The fact is the industry came forward .  The industry is obviously anxious to see the legislation go through . 
We do not want to wait . 
We need to get it through . 
Obviously , if the industry can live with this five year phase-in , although as I pointed out to the member that the exception of a new mineral exploration credit will only take three years , if the provinces can live with it , then I hope the member can live with it . 
I certainly respect the fact that the member is concerned about the legislation .  I thank him for the question . 
The reality is that after the consultations , after the discussion before the Standing Committee on Finance where no amendments were proposed , if we get this through in a timely fashion , we will be able to deal with the very issues with which that member has indicated he is concern . 
Mr. Serge Cardin ( Sherbrooke , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the hon. member opposite . 
When the government is considering changes of such magnitude , I presume it develops models and makes projections . 
Could the hon. member tell me what these projections are ? 
Can he confirm that all sectors in the natural resources industry , all the mines and the oil companies , will benefit from these changes ?  As far as the oil industry is concerned , we know for certain that a $ 250 million surplus will be created rather quickly . 
What will the impact be on each category of mines ? 
Will all of them benefit from these lower taxes or tax changes ? 
Can the hon. member tell us honestly if there will be differences and what they will be ? 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert : 
Mr. Speaker , there is nothing like asking a question when the answer is already known , and I assume the member knows the answer . 
Yes , overall this will have a positive impact on the industry . 
There is no question that some specific individual companies may benefit more than others . 
The industry accepts that . 
The Mining Association of Canada has made it very clear that even though some may not benefit initially and others may benefit greatly , it wants to see the legislation go through . 
It would not be fair to tell the member that everyone will benefit on day one .  Clearly , overall the vast majority will benefit significantly because of these measures . 
Mr. Joe Comartin ( Windsor -- St. Clair , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the process of developing the provisions of Bill C-48 , did the government take into account the impact of the continued burning of fossil fuels , whether it be gas , oil or coal ? 
More particular , has there been any meaningful consultation by the government with environmental groups that have positioned themselves in a very clear fashion about the continued and now expanded use of incentives for the oil and gas industry and the coal industry ? 
Finally , in developing Bill C-48 was any consideration given to the facts that have now come out in the Conference Board report of this past weekend .  That report states that of the 24 leading industrial countries in the world , Canada produces more carbon dioxide per capita from the burning of fossil fuels ? 
We are the absolute worst country out of those 24 countries . 
Have any of those factors been taken into account in coming up with these kind of subsidies for the continued subsidization of the oil and gas industry ? 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not quite sure that I understand the question . 
The fact is these are tax measures . 
I mentioned some environmental aspects , but this essentially is a tax bill . 
It is there to benefit provinces such as Nova Scotia and the oil and gas industry . 
It is to put Canada on an internationally competitive advantage with others , and in particular within the North American sector . 
He specifically asked about coal burning , et cetera . 
That is not specifically germane to this bill . 
I understand the member has concerns in that regard . 
However , as far as the specific tax measures and if one type versus another type was taken into account , the answer is no . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am rising to speak at third reading stage of Bill C-48 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act with respect to natural resources . 
For several years I have fought , on behalf of my constituents , to obtain tax equity for the natural resource sector . 
I represent a suburban constituency in Calgary where by far the single largest employer is the energy sector . 
Often the energy sector is depicted as some great bogeyman , a great polluter , that rapes the resources of the earth and gives nothing back to society . 
In fact , it is an absolutely vital element of our economy , both in terms of growth and employment . 
If it were not for the energy sector and if it were not for the remarkable technology and ingenuity that makes up our energy industry , we would not be able to live so comfortably in this cold northern climate . 
We would not be able to do the many things that we take for granted , all of which depend on energy . 
The oil and gas sector of our economy is directly responsible for over 60,000 jobs and indirectly creates hundreds of thousands of others . 
It is an industry that is too often and too easily dismissed or disregarded . 
When the government adopted income tax changes for corporations in its 2000 budget by reducing over time the general rate to 21 % , it failed at that time to provide tax equity for the natural resource sector , which includes more than just oil and gas companies . 
The natural resource sector also includes mining companies and forestry companies . 
I suppose the government 's view at that time was that it needed to encourage the new economy in Canada and thought it ought not to provide incentives for the continued growth in the traditional industries which have historically constituted the heart of the Canadian economy , that is to say , primary industries like mining , oil and gas , and lumber . 
That was a huge mistake . 
To this day an enormous percentage of our exports upon which this economy depends come from the oil and gas , mining and forestry sectors . 
Collectively , those sectors constitute the largest employers in the country . 
Most of the remote communities in Canada are created and sustained by the non-renewable resource sector . 
In a sense , our very claim to sovereignty -- including many remote parts of the country in the north and from Labrador to British Columbia to the territories -- is dependent upon the enormous investments made and risks taken by oil and gas , mining and forestry companies . 
This is a sector that we should not dismiss as part of the old economy and a threat to the environment . 
To the contrary , we should applaud people who work in these sectors for the enormous technological ingenuity that they have developed and applied in the past couple of decades to make the extraction of resources increasingly efficient and environmentally friendly . 
We should recognize the hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs for working families that these companies helped to create . 
That is why I strongly opposed the creation of a two tier tax system in the 2000 budget : one tier for most corporations and another tier for the natural resources field . 
Unfortunately , it took three years for the government to realize that this inequity was unjustifiable after vigorous lobbying on the part of companies in that sector . 
It was not until the 2003 budget that the government finally proposed to correct this fundamental wrong . 
Unfortunately , it has now taken five years for the government to implement the changes proposed in the 2003 budget , and this is really my concern . 
I will support this bill . 
I voted for it last night along with my colleagues in the official opposition , but it would be our strong preference to see these changes implemented in one fiscal year so that we could move the non-renewable resource sector taxation from 28 % to 21 % and adopt the exemption for provincial royalties and the credit for mining in one year . 
I cannot believe that we must wait five years for the government to do that technically . 
It is simply stringing out the process of corporate tax equity because it wants the revenue . 
It wants to make the process as slow as possible so it can continue to generate more revenue from this sector which already pays an enormous tax burden . 
Indeed , the ostensible fiscal cost of this tax change will be relatively modest . 
For the federal government , whose budget is over $ 160 billion , once fully implemented , this tax change represents only $ 260 million which , as I pointed out in my question to the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance , is a relatively modest amount of money when one considers the kind of waste that we see and the kind of misplaced priorities that we observe on the part of the federal government . 
I am pleased that the bill will take into account the costs that are borne by oil and gas companies in paying provincial royalties . 
Originally , before this bill was introduced , before the 2003 budget the federal government was playing hardball with the oil and gas sector , saying that it will give the sector tax equity at a 21 % rate , but the trade-off will be that it will take away the royalty tax credit , otherwise known as the resource allowance . 
Collectively these companies pay billions of dollars in royalties to provincial governments . 
These royalties are an important part of provincial revenue streams . 
We can see that now in places like Newfoundland and Labrador , and increasingly in Nova Scotia where the provincial treasuries have been enriched by new oil and gas royalty revenues coming on stream . 
It was fundamentally unfair for the government to spend three years playing cat and mouse with the energy sector saying that it will give the sector tax equity but only on the face of it , because it will take away the sector 's ability to deduct from federal tax the cost of provincial royalty taxes . 
I am glad to see that while the government has indeed eliminated the resource allowance here , it has offset the fiscal effect of that by creating in this bill a deduction for provincial royalties against federal taxes . 
That is absolutely necessary and we will be watching closely to ensure that it remains the case . 
Similarly , we are pleased to see that an enriched credit has been provided for mining companies to ensure that the loss of the resource allowance will not negatively affect them . 
I understand that the net fiscal effect on mining companies will be positive . 
They will not be net losers as a consequence of losing the resource allowance while moving the rate to 21 % . 
In closing , we support the principle of the bill . 
We regret it has taken so long to arrive . 
We believe that the eight year delay in arriving at tax equity for the resource sector reflects a basic bias that the government has against that sector of the economy , and we regret that . 
It will continue to be a priority for the Canadian Alliance to press toward lower tax rates across the economy generally , including the most productive sector of the economy , that is , the major employers in the corporate sector . 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the member 's comments on Bill C-48 . 
I would like to remind him that the enactment includes measures to implement a deduction for crown royalties and mining taxes , to eliminate the resource allowance , to reduce the corporate tax rate applicable to resource income , and to introduce a new 10 % tax credit for qualifying mineral exploration expenses . 
The member agreed with the changes but had some comments about delays . 
He concluded that he agreed with the bill in principle , which is what we do at second reading and did at second reading . 
This is third reading now . 
This is not the time to agree in principle . 
This is the time to agree with the bill , its provisions and its implementation schedule and details . 
I would therefore ask the member , is there anything in this bill , not just in principle but in detail , that he has a problem with and if he has one , how would he resolve it ? 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , yes , I do have a problem in detail with the bill , and that is the schedule for its full implementation . 
I must admit that I was not fully engaged with this bill at report stage . 
Had I been , I would have proposed an amendment to move the implementation phase from five years to one year , knowing of course that the amendment would fail . 
Knowing that we have a five year implementation scheme in the bill , I will support it nevertheless because I want the resource sector to receive full tax equity as soon as possible . 
Mr. Pierre Paquette ( Joliette , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened carefully to the hon. member 's remarks . 
I am a bit surprised at his conclusion that this reform is a win-win situation and that nobody will lose , when the Mining Association of Canada told the finance committee that it would be disadvantaged by this tax reform .  Not by the reduction in the tax rate from 28 % to 21 % , obviously , but by the changes in other tax rules . 
Gordon Peeling , the chairman and chief executive officer of the Mining Association of Canada , told us that if Bill C-48 were not amended , with the impact of this reform and other reforms announced by the government , like the capital tax , the effective tax rate of mining companies will increase by 3 % in 2003 , 7 % in 2004 , 10 % in 2005 , 19 % in 2006 and 29 % in 2007 . 
I cannot understand how the hon. member can suggest that this will be good for the mining industry . 
There is probably no mine in his riding . 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his comments . 
He is quite right .  There are no mining companies in my riding . 
However , there are many oil and gas companies . 
This is why I am so concerned about the oil and gas industry 's tax position . 
I have to admit that I am indeed not too familiar with the technicalities of this bill as they impact mining companies . 
This being said , I accept my colleague 's remarks . 
However , I want to say that the government has to address the mining companies ' concerns about the tax regime . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , one of the things that we have learned recently in the oil and gas industry is that the refinery in Oakville is to be closed by Petro-Canada . 
It will be closing up shop and producing dirty gas until 2005 , then importing gas from Europe and distributing it across its grid in Ontario , even though it could be an Esso product or something else . 
One of the things that it has chosen not to do is invest in improving the refining operation to ensure it as clean gas . 
I would like to ask the hon. member , would this guarantee that Petro-Canada will actually clean up its act , produce clean gas , keep the jobs and give something back to the community as well . 
Would that happen with this actual measure right here ? 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , I actually have to admit ignorance about the question the member is asking . 
It is in the interest of these companies economically to develop technology which is environmentally friendly . 
One sees the enormous progress they have made historically , but I cannot comment on the particular case the member has raised . 
Mr. Paul Szabo : 
Mr. Speaker , the member in response to a previous question referred to report stage and the possibility of getting an implementation schedule change . 
I am sure there is a good reason why we do not take the opportunity for doing those things . 
It is kind of sad that in this place sometimes we do not do things because we anticipate that it will not be passed in any event . 
It really is a disappointment because I believe the important thing is that the item be raised for consideration and shared with members and to explain the significance of the change whether or not it might have a likelihood of passing . 
In this place almost anything can happen . 
There is a full moon over Ottawa right now and I honestly believe that if we ask for it , we just might get it . 
On the schedule , I ask the member again , he knows that if someone had moved a motion or considered that same item in committee , another member would not have been able to do it at report stage . 
It bothers me that somehow members ' rights to make report stage motions may be superseded by the fact that someone frivolously raised issues in committee simply to frustrate the ability to do it at report stage . 
I wanted to raise that as a comment because it is an element of parliamentary reform that we ought to consider . 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , I accept the hon. member 's remarks and I agree with the concern he has . 
For instance , I am not a member of the natural resources committee and I am not apprised of its business . 
When amendments are considered there that I have not had the ability to consider or look at , even though the bill concerns me and my constituents , I am essentially put at a disadvantage when the bill returns to the House for consideration at report stage . 
I understand why the change in the standing orders was adopted three years ago following what some regarded as the presentation of some dilatory amendments at report stage . 
However , what is dilatory to the government constitutes legitimate opposition on this side of the House . 
I think we need to find a better balance in the standing orders so that members like myself can bring forward at report stage in the House substantive amendments which they were not able to address at committee . 
Mr. Pierre Paquette ( Joliette , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first I would like to congratulate the member for Calgary Southeast on his frankness and also on his good command of the French language . 
I am pleased to speak to Bill C-48 because the government is now trying to bring the House to adopt legislation that we feel is not fair for the majority of our natural resources industries , especially in the mining area . 
I appreciate the fact that it is quite a technical bill , but it seems to me that if we take a close look at it , it soon becomes obvious that it needs to be amended . 
Unfortunately , the Liberals did not want to listen to reason in the finance committee . 
In fact , in the mining sector , it is not only Quebec that is hurt by Bill C-48 , but also Ontario , Manitoba and the Atlantic provinces . 
It is very hard for me to understand that hon. members representing ridings in Ontario , Manitoba and the Atlantic provinces are not examining this bill to see how it will hurt the mines in their ridings , their regions or their provinces , just because it is rather technical . 
This is a bill that can be improved ; I will return to that later . 
Passage of Bill C-48 will lead eventually to some mines being closed and jobs being lost . 
Perhaps some communities will break up because a mine is often the only reason for a community 's existence . 
As we know , Bill C-48 restructures taxes in the natural resources sector . 
The argument put forward by the Liberal government -- and even by the Canadian Alliance , I have noticed -- is that Bill C-48 restores equity between the natural resources sector and other sectors of the economy . 
Thanks to the former finance minister and future prime minister , the other sectors have enjoyed a tax reduction in the 2000 budget , which lowered the tax rate from 28 to 21 % over five years . 
And that is the positive aspect of Bill C-48 . 
Now the natural resources sector , like all the other sectors , will benefit from the same reduction , although somewhat later . 
On that score , I agree completely with the hon. member who preceded me . 
Thus , Bill C-48 would lower tax rates from 28 % to 21 % over five years . 
The reform of corporate tax structures in the natural resources industry was delayed because it is a special kind of taxation . 
There is not just the rate of tax on profits . 
There are also a number of taxes imposed through royalties , for example . 
That was why the ex-minister of finance and future prime minister delayed the tax reform for natural resources . 
They tell us they held consultations . 
But this consultation must have been , like so many others done by this government , more public relations than true consultation . 
Thus , we find ourselves with a bill that is totally unfair and unacceptable to a certain number of businesses in the natural resources sector . 
Bill C-48 cuts the tax rate from 28 % to 21 % . 
As I mentioned , this is the good part of the bill , and the Liberals and the government refer to it repeatedly . 
But there are three other measures in Bill C-48 . 
We must consider the net effect of this reform , not just one part of this bill . 
I want to talk about the three other measures . 
Other than the tax rate on profits dropping from 28 % to 21 % , the bill will phase in a deduction for provincial royalties , related to the use of non-renewable resources . 
This is a new deduction . 
However , and this is the third measure , the current 25 % resource allowance will be eliminated . 
The allowance allows natural resource companies to deduct 25 % of their profits , on the extraction portion of their activities , prior to paying income tax . 
This 25 % tax credit on resources would be dropped and they would instead be able to deduct provincial royalties . 
The fourth measure is a new tax credit for qualifying pre-production mining expenditures , applicable solely to diamond mining and base metal mining . 
So , as I mentioned , we cannot talk only about the first part of the reform , to reduce the tax rate from 28 % to 21 % over five years .  The net effect of all four measures must be taken into consideration . 
However , according to the Mining Association of Canada , supported by the Quebec Mining Association Inc. , Bill C-48 will increase the effective tax rate of many mining companies . 
I am not saying that the entire industry will suffer as a result of Bill C-48 , but the effective tax rate of a large segment of this sector will increase under the proposed reform in Bill C-48 . 
Mature mines will be harder hit simply because these mines typically pay relatively low royalties in comparison to what other natural resource sectors pay , particularly oil and gas companies . 
This is easily understood . 
There has been competition between the provinces , as well as between Canada and other countries , which has led the provincial governments to reduce their taxes or royalties .  As a result , this sector pays lower royalties to use non-renewable resources , and will not benefit from Bill C-48 . 
However , oil and gas companies and the like will benefit greatly . 
I can readily understand the member for Calgary Southeast saying , `` There are oil and gas companies in my area , and they will benefit from this , so I am not looking any further than that '' . 
But I think that , if we really want this House to represent all of the interests of Canada and Quebec , we must consider the big picture . 
Because the oil and gas companies pay a lot of royalties , they will benefit from Bill C-48 , while a number of the mining companies , particularly the mature mines , will be disadvantaged by this reform . 
Proof of this was given by the Minister of Finance himself , when department officials and the parliamentary secretary appeared before the Standing Committee on Finance . 
We were told that in all the reform was going to cost the public purse $ 250 million once it was fully operational . 
I have some doubts about that figure . 
I asked them to tell us the calculation method used for that evaluation , and I am still waiting for the answer . 
If we start with the assumption that this figure is accurate , then 80 % of that $ 250 million in tax cuts will , according to the finance department witnesses , go to the oil and gas companies . 
Imagine . 
The finance minister himself says that his reform will benefit the oil and gas companies first and foremost , and a mere 20 % will go to all the rest of the natural resource companies combined . 
This is unacceptable . 
According to the assessment made by Gordon Peeling , President and CEO of the Mining Association of Canada , overall , with Bill C-48 , the mining sector as a whole will benefit from a tax cut of $ 10 million of that $ 250 million , or 1/25th of the entire natural resources sector tax reductions . 
In connection with that $ 10 million figure , there will be some losers and some winners . 
Consequently , this reform is unfair . 
One of the negative effects of the proposed reform is that by replacing tax credits for resources with royalties instead , income tax rates will increase in several provinces for base metals and for some gold mining operations in particular , which are concentrated in northern Quebec and northern Ontario . 
It is hard to understand why Ontario MPs would support this bill without hesitation . 
Manitoba and the Atlantic provinces will also be disadvantaged by this reform . 
I am not the only one who thinks so , and it is not just the Mining Association of Canada saying this . 
In the September 2003 issue of CAmagazine , there is an article by Neil Smith entitled `` Energy Update '' , and I quote : 
All these provinces use federal taxable income as the starting point for the computation of provincial income and allow a deduction for the greater of provincial Crown royalties or resource allowance . 
For each of these provinces the loss of the resource allowance increases the effective rate as follows : Saskatchewan , 4.5 % ; Manitoba , 2.9 % ; Quebec , 2.25 % ; and Maritime provinces , 3.25 % to 4 % . 
Association epresentatives from the association generally told us that the tax rates would increase by 3 % in 2003 , 7 % in 2004 , 10 % in 2005 , 19 % in 2006 and 29 % in 2007 . 
And we are being asked to believe that this bill is fair to all natural resource sectors and all the regions in Canada . 
That is utterly untrue . 
Quebec and other provinces , in particular , will be disadvantaged . 
The federal government will say that the provinces only have to adjust and lower their tax rates . 
But they should not lower their royalties , because they would put their companies at a disadvantage . 
The Mining Association of Canada also said that even if tax rates were changed to take into account the reform proposed in Bill C-48 , tax rates would still go up on an average by 2 % in 2004 , 2 % in 2005 , 4 % in 2006 and 6 % in 2007 . 
That would make us less competitive than mining countries where the tax system is much more favourable . 
Generally , across Canada , Bill C-48 will result in an effective tax rate increase from 40 % to 43 % , whereas in China , as you know , the tax rate on mining is quite low , I would even say symbolic . 
The tax rate dropped from 43 % to 34 % in Brazil , from 35 % to 30 % in South Africa , and from 29 % to 25 % in Finland . 
So the government is telling us that by increasing the effective tax rate , especially on the base metal sector , we will increase the competitiveness of our natural resource industry . 
That is totally unacceptable . 
To rectify such unfairness and economic nonsense , I put forward a simple amendment in the Standing Committee on Finance . 
It was of course rejected by the Liberals out of pure partisanship . 
I had the support of my Canadian Alliance colleague and I thank him for that . 
My suggestion was a phased-in increase in the tax credit for pre-production mining expenditures from 10 % to 20 % -- the fourth part of the reform -- over a three year period . 
That would help reduce the negative impact of Bill C-48 I just talked about at some length , especially in Northern Ontario and Northern Quebec , where base metals are put at a disadvantage by Bill C-48 . 
This would stimulate exploration and might put an end to the current downward trend with regard to our metal reserves . 
I will quote a few statistics in this regard . 
From 1977 to 2001 , Canadian copper reserves decreased by 61 % ; nickel reserves decreased by 44 % ; lead reserves decreased by 89 % ; zinc reserves decreased by 71 % ; and silver reserves decreased by 59 % . 
With a tax credit for the preparation of mining operations , we could offset the negative effects of Bill C-48 and redress the current drift toward the depletion of our reserves of minable metals . 
This could help our regions . 
Mines are rarely found in the middle of an urban centre ; normally , mines are located in outlying areas . 
Raising the tax credit for qualifying mineral exploration expenses would provide a stimulus to our regions . 
The cost of that additional provision in Bill C-48 is estimated at $ 40 million . 
Given the surpluses accumulated by the federal government over the last few years , I think that $ 40 million is a very reasonable price to pay for ensuring equity in such a key sector as natural resources , and particularly the mining industry . 
Replacing one figure replaced in the legislation would have led to real reform . 
We proposed 20 % instead of 10 % , but the Liberals voted against that . 
I cannot understand how the member for Témiscamingue , a recent newcomer to the House , can remain silent in the face of something so detrimental to the Témiscamingue . 
I cannot understand why the member for Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik , who is normally so talkative , does not protest against legislation that will be so harmful to the Abitibi mines . 
If they are silent , it has to be because they are just yes-men who follow the party line . 
If they looked after their constituents ' interests , they would put the necessary pressure on the government to amend Bill C-48 so that it does not hurt the mining sector , as the Mining Association of Canada and the Quebec Mining Association said it would . 
Of course we know that this government heavily favours the oil and gas industry , and this is especially true of the former finance minister and future prime minister . 
One just has to look , for example , at the total amount of subsidies that this industry has received for its development over the last 30 or 40 years . 
We are talking here about $ 66 billion , whereas the hydroelectricity industry in Quebec received nothing , or practically nothing , for its development . 
One just has to look also at the preferred status given to the oil and gas industry by the current Prime Minister 's office in the form of guarantees with regard to the Kyoto agreement . 
However , it is difficult to understand why members would not come to the defence of their communities , their mining industries and their workers . 
But I am not totally surprised because , since I have had the honour of being appointed to the position of finance critic by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois , there have been many cases where , unfortunately , common sense did not prevail . 
In that context , I will remind members of the issue of the GST for school boards . 
A decision had been made by the courts , but it was reversed here through an act of Parliament . 
This was a first in Canadian parliamentary history . 
Quebec school boards were deprived of $ 8 million , and Ontario school boards were deprived of $ 10 million . 
The fiscal imbalance has put the provinces in dire straits . 
Nine provinces out of ten will post a deficit next year , while the federal government will continue to rack up surpluses . 
The Minister of Finance tells us that these surpluses will not be as large , but even though they may not be as large as what the minister had hidden , they will still be very real . 
We know that , from 1994 to 2001 , this government cut $ 24 billion from the Canada social transfer , including $ 8.7 billion for Quebec alone . 
One third of these cuts were made at the expense of Quebec and the people of Quebec , while we account for only 25 % of the Canadian population . 
Take the excise tax of 1.5¢ per litre , for example . 
It was introduced by the former finance minister and future prime minister to fight the deficit . 
We have been deficit free since 1997 , but the tax remains . 
This is money the government is taking out of the pockets of taxpayers , money that could be used for other purposes . 
Let us consider how the government is handling the tax haven issue . 
It finds nothing wrong with these jurisdictions being used by citizens to avoid paying taxes in Canada . 
It is therefore not likely in the short term that Bill C-48 will be amended . 
We will be voting against the bill at third reading , while hoping that this place will come to its senses as the election nears . 
Personally , for the well-being of our mining industry in Quebec , Ontario , Atlantic Canada and Manitoba , I hope that the government will change course on this issue , that it will use common sense and make one tiny little change to Bill C-48 , raising the tax credit for preparatory activities for mining . 
We do hope the situation can be corrected . 
However , as I said , in the current context , we cannot , in all conscience , support a bill that is fundamentally unfair , even though we agree with some of its provisions , such as the reduction in corporate tax from 28 % to 21 % . 
Let me conclude by reiterating the hope that , on the side of the ruling party , on the Liberal side , members will speak out to have this situation corrected . 
As I said , it would be very easy . 
We could have a tax reform in the natural resource sector , one that would be really fair to all natural resource industries in all regions of Canada and Quebec . 
Mr. Guy St-Julien ( Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have listened carefully to the comments by the hon. member . 
Some things are true , but I cannot agree with what he has said about us , the Liberal members from Abitibi and the resource regions . 
I understand that some resource regions have only tobacco growing ; others have mining . 
I am a former miner , myself . 
In my remarks , I want to comment on the fact that he said no one has intervened . 
I have here a letter dated February 21 , 2002 , in which I told my government , the former finance minister , the Liberal member for LaSalle -- Émard , that it was necessary to consider the same sort of reductions for small and medium-size businesses as for other sectors . 
It was necessary to reduce the general corporate tax rate from 28 % in 2000 to 21 % in 2004 . 
As for small and medium-size businesses , it is very odd that the Bloc is not discussing what was happening in these companies , that no one took the differences between various industries into account . 
On the other hand , when we discuss natural resources , these members say we do not stand up for our constituents . 
We know that there is always room for improvement in bills . 
I have here some notes from my friends in the mining sector . 
They point out the difference between junior and senior mining companies and explain the repercussions of Bill C-48 . 
The issue is this : we know that we must improve the tax system not only for the large , senior companies , but also for the junior companies and small mining corporations . 
Still , to go from that to saying that we have not intervened ; I am sorry , but this is a false debate at the expense of our resource regions . 
Because in these regions , when there is no more ore , there is still a problem with respect to the price of metals . 
Today , our problem is the issue of the rising dollar . 
One point is very important : we do intervene . 
I do not want anyone to say to me that we do not intervene ; you are not aware of the letters we write to the minister . 
We work from within ; we work in our ridings . 
We do not see these hon. members in our regions and our mines very often . 
I used to be a miner . 
We do not often see them around Chapais-Chibougamau , or even in Val d'Or . 
I understand that this bill needs improvement , but it is a first step and I am satisfied . 
Some things must be amended , but we have to work together . 
If they are going to call us liars and say we are doing nothing , they can go to the devil . 
Mr. Pierre Paquette : 
I never called the member a liar , Mr. Speaker . 
I believe you can attest to that . 
I said I did not understand why we did not hear the member for Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik and the member for Témiscamingue publicly demand , as I am doing , a simple amendment to Bill C-48 to increase the pre-production mining expenditure tax credit from 10 % to 20 % . 
On October 1 , 2003 , the Mining Association of Canada presented a brief to the Standing Committee on Finance . 
It was not six months ago or six years ago . 
It was last Wednesday . 
The president of the association , Mr. Peeling , came to implore us to make this change ; it does not eliminate all the unfairness , but it is the compromise the Mining Association put forward . 
The only ones who supported the amendment were the Bloc Quebecois members . 
In the end we got the support of the Canadian Alliance members when they understood what was at stake . 
On the Liberal side , one member supported us and another one said -- and I can understand him to a point -- that he agreed in principle with the amendment , but that he was concerned we might lose the bill . 
I cannot see how we could lose a bill at this stage , if everybody agreed on a very simple amendment to Bill C-48 and if we had the support of the Liberal majority . 
For our part , we work for our people in the regions . 
I never said the member was a liar . 
I would have liked him to publicly state his position on Bill C-48 . 
He might do it in the next few minutes . 
He may have looked at the changes requested by the Mining Association of Canada and the Quebec Mining Association . 
People at Cambior approached us . 
I was secretary general at the CSN and I toured mines in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region and across Quebec . 
I know this situation well . 
It does not prevent me from still standing up for our regions and our mining sector . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to go back once again to the situation in Oakville . 
I just received some more information . 
We know that the Petro-Canada plant there is closing . 
It is going to produce dirty gas . 
Instead of actually improving the facility and keeping the jobs , it is going to import gasoline from Europe and re-brand it even though it is another company 's gasoline . 
Unfortunately , we will lose a bunch of workers and on top of that , we will have dirty gas until 2005 . 
It is an unacceptable position from the government because it is almost a 20 % shareholder in Petro-Canada . 
Based on the estimates that we have right now , if it extends its 2002 targets to this year , it is going to get approximately $ 7.5 million from this act . 
This is very insulting in the sense that the government , as a 20 % shareholder , will actually receive money back for throwing workers on the street and producing dirty gas in Ontario . 
It makes no sense whatsoever . 
It is insulting . 
I would like the hon. member to comment on this suggestion . 
If the government had any integrity , it would give that money to those workers as severance pay . 
The government is going to get some money back because it is an equity holder in Petro-Canada . 
Maybe that money should be given back to the workers . 
Mr. Pierre Paquette : 
Mr. Speaker , on the issue of the closing of the Oakville refinery by Petro-Canada , I also think this is unfortunate . 
Even though the company is claiming that it is transferring a part of its Oakville activities to Montreal , it is not fooling anyone . 
The refinery capacity will be reduced in Canada and in Quebec . 
What will be the result ? 
This will simply lead to higher prices , while the federal government is refusing to take its responsibilities concerning competition in this industry . 
The Minister of Industry tells us that the retail price is under provincial jurisdiction , and this is true . 
But the root problem is refining . 
Refining is controlled by major companies , including Petro-Canada . 
By closing the Oakville plant , the company has reduced supply and found another way to increase its profits by affecting the whole chain , up to the consumer . 
In this sense , the member can be sure that the Bloc Quebecois supports efforts by the workers and people of Oakville to keep this refinery open . 
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering -- Ajax -- Uxbridge , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened closely to the speech by the hon. member opposite . 
I am very interested in the fact that the hon. member from the NDP spoke about the dirty gas and all the other problems that would be caused by the closure of this facility . 
To the hon. member who answered his question , I know one of the reasons why the number of refineries in this country has dropped dramatically . 
I am very disappointed by this situation , and obviously I am not justifying it . 
Two or three players control this industry in each region . 
Petro-Canada is also a serious cause for concern in Newfoundland , where it just closed not only its refinery but also its gas station franchises . 
One of the legitimate reasons for this closure is simply the amount of sulphur in the gas . 
To obtain a profitable product , there must be a balance with the United States , and there are other products available with 30 million particles per million . 
As the hon. member knows , Canada went ahead on the issue of sulphur reduction in gasoline . 
It is one of the reasons the major oil companies have decided they may shut this . 
Does he not see a concern as far as going ahead of the international market on sulphur in gasoline and that this is maybe one of the reasons it is so expensive ? 
Mr. Pierre Paquette : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very familiar with this issue , but it is a bit troubling that a company , in which the federal government is a shareholder , did not take the necessary measures over time to ensure that its technology and production methods complied with current and future environmental regulations . 
Surely there is a lesson in all this , also in terms of the union . 
Obviously , I am not familiar with the problem in Oakville , but when I was at the CSN , we told our unions to be extremely vigilant on the issue of technological investments so as to be on the cutting edge and not get caught in a situation where , for environmental or other reasons , a facility is forced to close or people claim that things are bad enough for it to close . 
In the Oakville case , surely with the necessary technological and environmental investments , refining capacity could be maintained . 
Everyone knows that , when supply drops and demands remains constant , prices increase . 
This is a simple law of economics that everyone subscribes to . 
What bothers me is the Canada-wide decrease in supply . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon -- Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak at third reading of Bill C-48 . 
My colleague the member for Kings -- Hants has had carriage of this piece of legislation . 
He is now with the finance committee somewhere across the country and it has fallen to my delicate hands to take it to the next stage . 
Our party will be supporting Bill C-48 . 
I appreciate that the members from the Bloc , and certainly the member speaking after me from the NDP , have different philosophical positions with respect to business management and labour . 
Certainly their philosophical positions will come out in their opposition to this piece of legislation . 
The NDP and the Bloc make no bones about it that they are not friends of industry . 
They are not friends of business . 
They are not friends of being able to generate the economy in the natural resources sector . 
I appreciate my colleague from the Bloc helping me in protecting Manitoba with respect to this legislation . 
He indicated many times that Manitoba would be the net loser should this bill go forward . 
I do not agree with that . 
I believe in competition . 
My province of Manitoba has certainly seen the benefits and the opportunities in the mining sector . 
It sees the benefits and opportunities certainly in the natural resources sector . 
As a matter of fact , the majority of Manitoba 's GDP is from natural resources , whether it be agriculture , mining or forestry . 
We see that there are advantages . 
As a matter of fact , Manitoba has put in quite a number of changes to its own tax system , tax rate and royalty system to encourage mining . 
We have some very large mining operations in Manitoba with Inco and Falconbridge . 
We want to continue to be able to compete in the world market . 
In order to do that Bill C-48 corrects some of that inequality . 
We were somewhat dumbstruck when it was brought forward in the 2000 budget that there would be a reduction in the general corporate income tax rate from 28 % to 21 % . 
We were actually thunderstruck when we found out this did not include the natural resource industry . 
Oil and gas , minerals and mining were excluded from the 2000 budget . 
I do not know whether the NDP at that time stood up and said wow . 
There is a huge industry that has been neglected . 
Bill C-48 brings that back into line . 
There is an equity issue that has to be resolved and Bill C-48 resolves it by adding the mining sector to the reduction in the tax rate from 28 % to 21 % . 
There are other issues with respect to the legislation . 
There are phase-outs . 
Certainly the 25 % phase-out is going to have some concerns . 
My colleague from the Bloc spoke to that . 
Manitoba will have a reduction in revenue streams because of that tax reduction . 
That may be true , but we also have enough foresight to recognize that there should well be revenue streams or revenues increased by encouraging exploration , by encouraging mining operations to come into Manitoba , northern Manitoba specifically , and by encouraging these industries to not only explore but process the raw materials they extract from the earth . 
This is what we were built on and this is what we want to continue to do . 
We want to encourage that so there will be more union jobs developed in Manitoba , so union jobs can be increased in the sector that this is trying to assist . 
Bring equity back into the system . 
I hear somewhere in the background the member from Windsor suggesting perhaps that is not the case . 
As I said at the outset , there are philosophical differences . 
I believe in the private sector developing economy . 
I believe in that . 
Also I believe that profit is not a dirty word . 
That may send them into apoplectic shock , but the fact is there has to be profit in a sector . 
There has to be profit in an industry in order for that industry to reinvest in itself and reinvest in its employees , in their training and their pension plans . 
That is what the economy is all about . 
I do not have to lecture the member for Windsor West on economics 101 , but I do have to lecture the member and say that the inequalities in the industrial sectors do not bode well for Canadians . 
We do have tough competition in the oil and gas and the mining sectors . 
We have competition offshore . 
China has some very strong advantages compared to us . 
The labour costs in China are substantially less than they are in Canada . 
We have to compete in the way we can and that is obviously in our tax rates . 
We cannot take from the industries so often that they are not able to reinvest back into this area . 
I appreciate the Bloc 's position on most of the issues . 
The Bloc members are suggesting that there will be revenue losses . 
I appreciate the Bloc trying to protect Manitoba , but we really do not need that protection . 
We can look after ourselves . 
More than that , I am sure the Bloc 's concern is more about the federal-provincial jurisdictional issues as it always is . 
Obviously the Bloc has some difficulties with the federal government getting involved in any kind of provincial jurisdiction . 
This is one of those areas . 
When Bill C-48 becomes law , it will be necessary for the federal government to work with the provincial governments to ensure that the resulting provincial revenues are redirected to the affected mining industry . 
Basically , my good friends in the Bloc are telling the federal government not to step on Quebec 's jurisdictional toes . 
In fact , this is a federal responsibility . 
Bill C-48 is a federal responsibility in setting tax rates for the industry .  It is up to the government to set those rates . 
There is never any perfect legislation . 
We certainly know the government is not perfect ; that is an understatement . 
We know there could have been amendments -- 
Mr. Dan McTeague : Shame . 
Say it is not so . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik : Now I am even getting heckled from the government side , Mr. Speaker . 
However those members should be our friends on this issue because Bill C-48 has to go through . 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert : That is the most intelligent thing you have said all day . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik : Mr. Speaker , the most intelligent thing I have said was that the government historically has not been very successful in managing other portfolios . 
It has not been very successful in managing departments . 
The list is endless . 
There are too many other things that we could add to the list , but Bill C-48 is not one of them . 
I stand on behalf of my colleague from Kings -- Hants on this piece of legislation . 
The Progressive Conservative Party will be supporting Bill C-48 simply because of the equality that is necessary in the sectors . 
It is absolutely vital that we continue exploration in the oil and gas industry . 
It is absolutely vital that we encourage that exploration to continue . 
Bill C-48 is a way of doing that . 
It is absolutely vital that the revenues that are generated are part of Canada 's economy , part of our GDP . 
Our quality of life depends on it . 
I know the NDP would like to nationalize just about everything that we have , but that is not philosophically the way we should be going in this country . 
Bill C-48 will make it more fair with the tax rates that will be put into place . 
We in the Progressive Conservative Party will be supporting this piece of legislation . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when we are discussing economic issues , it is frustrating to hear the example of China being brought forward . 
Many people have indicated that in order for Canada to compete with China , we should bring our quality of life down to its level , that we should have its pollution , its environment , and its wage level . 
That is the wrong thing to do . 
It is very difficult to accept that argument . 
Nobody wants that as the national goal for Canada . 
I was at a meeting where an auto manufacturer said that our objective should be to have the same wages and conditions as the workers in China . 
That is not acceptable . 
That is a complete reversal of the way we need to go to keep our quality of life . 
If the industry can take care of itself , why does it need hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies every year ? 
In 1950 the fossil fuel and nuclear power industries received around $ 350 billion worth of subsidies from Canadian taxpayers . 
Should they pay that back now ? 
If they can take care of themselves , if they can be in a free market economy , should they pay that back ? 
Mr. Rick Borotsik : 
Mr. Speaker , this is another example of NDP industrialized fearmongering . 
I suspect if the member is talking about the subsidies , then perhaps all those industries should get paid all the royalties and taxes they paid and all the employee benefits they have paid over the last centuries . 
I do not think that would be the case . 
As for China , there is a reality here .  By the way , more fearmongering that we should be bringing our salary scales back down to those levels of China . 
As long as I have ever dealt with any industrial user , any manufacturer , any retailer , I have never heard anybody say such a foolish thing , that we should be bringing our salary levels down to those in China . 
That is absolutely ridiculous . 
We have in Canada something in which we take a lot of pride , our quality of life . 
Our standard of living is dependent upon those things that we are talking about in the bill .  We are dependent upon industry and upon jobs being created . 
We do not want to bring salaries down to Chinese levels .  Actually , we want to bring them up to American levels . 
That is where we have been going all along . 
We want to increase our standard of living and our quality of life .  That does not mean less salaries , that means more . 
This in fact will allow that to happen . 
Less money going to governments , more money going into exploration and more money going into industrial investment will bring more jobs , more activity and more wealth to the workers of this world . 
That is what we are trying to achieve . 
No , we are not trying to bring it down to China levels .  We are trying to bring it up . 
As for subsidies , as for standing on one 's own , taxation changes or a reduction in taxes does not mean that it is a subsidy . 
It means that these industries are paying less to governments , which , by the way , mismanages most of those dollars . 
I would rather see industries managing their dollars for the economy as opposed to having the government manage those dollars . 
That is where we are heading and I would like to see a reduction in those dollars paid to government . 
Mr. Brian Masse : 
Mr. Speaker , when we look at the situation in Oakville , this government will actually receive approximately $ 1.5 billion per year from this measure and , at the same time , it will put those workers out . 
Does the hon. member believe that money should go to those workers to ensure they have a future and can provide for their families ? 
Does he not believe that the government has a responsibility , and that it should be part of the bill , to ensure the workers will benefit on the ground floor ? 
If the government really believes in the workers , should they not get that money ? 
Mr. Rick Borotsik : 
Mr. Speaker , a long time ago , in another life , I learned that one should not get involved in labour negotiations . 
I believe that unionized labour has what is known as a collective agreement . 
In those collective agreements they have certain clauses , some of those clauses being separation and severance pay . 
If the union has done its job properly , I suspect those separation and severance agreements have been well clarified and the workers of the Oakville plant have been taken care of . 
I have no doubt that their union looked after them . 
Therefore they should have those severance clauses in that agreement . 
I can assure everyone that I am not about to renegotiate a collective agreement . 
Mr. Joe Comartin ( Windsor -- St. Clair , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I prepared some notes for my talk today , I could not help but feel like I was sort of in a surreal situation . 
We have this bill before us which will give further tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry , the mining industry , the concern there being , particularly from my perspective , the coal mining industry . 
It would reduce the tax level and give a tax credit over a period of years . 
We have to juxtapose the bill before us for third reading today with what is going on in this country and in the world . 
I come from an area of the country where we have major health problems , a great deal of which are directly related to the burning of fossil fuel , whether it be exhaust from cars or the coal-fired plants in Ontario and , more specifically , in the midwest of the United States that ends up being dumped into my area . 
We also have to put it into the perspective of the Kyoto agreement , which the Canadian people finally pressured the government into ratifying at the end of last year , and , in the context of that , the overall natural environment of the country . 
We know from lots of studies , but most recently just in this last week from the Conference Board of Canada , how badly we stack up compared to other countries around the globe . 
The Conference Board of Canada did an assessment of the 24 leading industrial countries in the world . 
Where do we stand on carbon dioxide , the direct result of the burning of fossil fuel ? 
We stand 24th out of 24 . 
We are dead last . 
We are also near the end in a whole bunch of other greenhouse gases . 
We are in the 21 , 22 and 23 range in each one of those areas . 
What we hear of course , and I think we heard it from one or two speakers on the government side , is that we have to keep doing this to keep the economy going . 
The Conference Board of Canada is not exactly a flaming environmentalist organization , but it makes the point , and I quote from the report that was issued this past week : 
Environmental progress need not come at the expense of economic gains , as many believe .. 
The board goes on to say in a summary : 
Many of the countries that lead the environment list also make the top 12 in the economy category . 
What it is saying is that there are countries around the globe , in that 24 grouping of the top industrialized countries , that have a high performing economy , that do well for their people , that have high incomes and a corporate world that does well , and at the same time protect their environment . 
We do not have to play one off against the other . 
With good economic policy , with progressive , forward looking economic policy we can accomplish both . 
We can take care of our natural environment . 
We can take care of the physical health of our population , and at the same time run a vibrant , strong , healthy economy . 
The two are not mutually exclusive at all . 
That is the Conference Board of Canada talking . 
Back to the context . 
We have Bill C-48 which would give more breaks to the fossil fuel industry , and we have it in that context of just how poorly we are doing as an industrialized country around the globe . 
Let us look at the specifics of what we are doing . 
This week the Green Budget Coalition came forward and made a presentation , as it has every year for the last seven or eight years , to the finance committee and , in fact , indirectly to the finance department , on how we green our economy and , more specifically , how we green our budgetary process . 
I will quote some of the statistics in its brief that it left with the committee where it talks about fossil fuels and takes a slice of the history . 
The brief states : 
Cumulative direct Government of Canada spending on fossil fuels between 1970 and 1999 totalled $ 40.4 billion . 
In addition , $ 2.8 billion in federal loans to fossil fuel industries have been written off since 1970 , over and above direct spending . 
We are at $ 43.2 billion over the last 29 years and that has continued for the last four years , bringing us forward to the kind of incentives we are now increasing to that industry . 
The brief juxtaposes it again to put it in some kind of context . 
It states :  For the period 1987 to 1998 , total government support for energy investments totalled $ 4.3 billion for non-renewable energy and only $ 118 million for renewable energy . 
That is a travesty when one looks at those results that we see all the time , the reason we needed to ratify Kyoto and the numbers that we see from the Conference Board of Canada . 
I will repeat that : $ 4.3 billion over that 11 year period from 1987 to 1998 for non-renewable energy , all of it going to the fossil fuel industry and the nuclear industry , and only $ 118 million for renewable energy . 
Whether it be wind , solar , current , wave or even hydroelectric , it was only $ 118 million , which is just a little over $ 10 million a year . 
In the same period of time billions and billions went to the non-renewable energy sector . 
In the brief there is a whole policy on to how to deal with budgetary matters , how to green the budget and how to green the economy from a tax , tax incentive , subsidy based , taking all those into account . 
In spite of the previous reports the coalition has filed with that committee and with the finance department , as we heard from the parliamentary secretary today , I do not think he even understood the work it has done . 
I think that is a fair categorization of the response I received from him at that time . 
Let us put into perspective how the fossil fuel industry has performed . 
It was interesting to listen to my colleague from the Conservative Party . 
I have no apologies to give as a member of the NDP on protecting jobs . 
Let us look at this industry . 
Since 1990 this industry has terminated the employment of some 80,000 people . 
I know some members will jump up and say that we are just worried about union jobs . 
Very few of those were union jobs . 
The vast majority , about 60,000 or three-quarters of them , were as a result of the shutdowns of small companies , retailers in the oil and gas industry . 
The industry just put them out of work and took them over itself . 
Those were small employers with five , ten or twenty employees , either full time or part time . 
Industry just wiped out 60,000 jobs in that sector , but what is being done ? 
The government is continuing with a government policy to subsidize that industry . 
Let us take a look at the consequences of these measures of reducing the effective tax rate from 28 % to 21 % and giving that 10 % tax credit . 
Just three of the big oil companies , not all of them , but Petro-Canada , Shell and Esso , have already forecast that they will save $ 250 million a year . 
That is how much of a tax break the government is giving these companies . 
Over the five year period , it will be some $ 1.25 billion .  That is how much the savings will be just for those companies . 
These companies are already making profits . 
If we look at their profit for this year we will see that these companies are making profits .  One company 's profit is $ 100 million .  One is up to $ 200 million . 
In fact , in some cases those are quarterly profits . 
We will see much higher ones over the course of this year , especially when we add on this subsidy . 
What does all this get us ? 
As consumers , have we seen rates go down at the gas pumps ? 
It is almost a joke to raise the question given what has transpired through the summer and the early fall . 
We have seen the price of fuel go up dramatically at the pumps . 
For those who are on fixed incomes , the price of home fuel in particular has gone up by a tragically high amount . 
We do not see those benefits passed on to the consumer . 
Do consumers benefit from these tax breaks ? 
No . 
Does the environment benefit ? 
Obviously not , given what is happening , nor does human health in this country . 
Are we somehow giving an advantage to the renewable energy sector ? 
Again the answer is no . 
Bill C-48 is being shoved through the House with the government and the official opposition supporting it in the face of that reality I have just detailed . 
I will cover one more point which I heard again from the government side as some justification for this : that we have to be internationally competitive . 
Let us look at the result . 
Let us look at the effect of these tax breaks for this industry . 
In regard to our closest competitor , the United States of America , specifically the state of Texas , and the effective current rate of tax for the fossil fuel industry , right now our tax rates have us about 5 % below the state of Texas . 
That is right now , before Bill C-48 is passed . 
If Bill C-48 passes the industry would effectively be paying 41 % in Alaska and 35 % in Texas . 
In Canada we would be down to 30.1 % across the country . 
This is effectively where it will end up . 
Therefore , we cannot argue that this is a competitive advantage bill , that this policy somehow will make us more competitive , because we already are in that situation . 
Right now we are competitive with our major trading partner . 
This would not help us with a competitive advantage internationally . 
It would not help consumers . 
It would not help the environment or our personal health , and it certainly would not enhance the production of energy from renewable energy sources . 
It begs the question , why are we doing this ? 
It was interesting to read the newspaper article by Susan Riley last week in the Ottawa Citizen . 
The headline was , `` While you're not looking , Big Oil is set to get a big tax break '' . 
As opposed to a number , the editorializing in that headline is pretty accurate . 
In that article , a couple of members of Parliament are quoted as saying they were under tremendous pressure . 
One is from the government side and one from the official opposition and they say they have been under tremendous pressure since the year 2000 to get these breaks for the oil and gas industry . 
That is really the answer to my question about why we are doing this . 
We are doing it because the industry asked for it and because , since the second world war , whenever big oil has asked for a break , it got a break . 
That has resulted in the situation we have in my home community , where we have high rates of cancer and other high rates of illness and disease directly related to the consumption of fossil fuels . 
It has resulted in the international need for Kyoto to get those reductions we need in the emissions of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere . 
It has resulted in very high energy costs , whether for home heating fuel or to power our motor vehicles . 
It is a policy that has failed from every aspect . 
What Bill C-48 is doing is perpetuating the economic system that is the underpinning for that industry . 
It is time for this government and this House to take seriously our responsibilities under Kyoto and to take seriously what we are hearing from environmentalists and progressive economists about what we can do to reduce those subsidies to the fossil fuel industry , to phase them out . 
Because we have to do that . 
We do not have enough oil and gas to continue our consumption beyond somewhere between 2030 and 2050 at the rates at which we are consuming now . 
We simply cannot do it . 
The supplies are not there , anywhere in the world . 
We need to change that policy . 
We need to phase out that industry . 
In order to do that , we must have a comprehensive policy initiative in the tax field . 
We cannot do this just by signing on to an international protocol like Kyoto . 
We do have to do that , but then we have to implement . 
That does not mean just starting a retrofit program , which we need to do in Canada , and not just doing a conservation program , which we also need to do . 
In addition , what is sorely lacking in the Kyoto plan , and we see that with the bill , is any concept from the government about understanding the need to reform our tax structure . 
We have to reduce the incentives provided to the fossil fuel industry , on a gradual , phased out basis , and replace them with incentives , tax breaks and subsidies for the renewable energy sector . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Madam Speaker , I have a few questions to which I would like answers . 
Last night we had votes in the House of Commons , as we often do on Tuesdays and Wednesdays . 
There was a vote last night on a bill proposing a small tax deduction for volunteer emergency workers . 
The bill proposed that they would be able to get a small tax deduction for volunteering their time and expertise in a number of different emergency situations , which costs them personally but provides so much value to communities because they get that confidence , they save money and they provide security for people in their homes , at their businesses and on their streets . 
That vote was lost .  It was for a small tax deduction for emergency volunteers . 
There was not enough money for that . 
My first question , and I have two more , is how does the member feel about that ? 
I am disgusted . 
I find it hard to believe that the government cannot provide that tax deduction when at the same time it can provide major tax relief for businesses and companies . 
But it does not for individual Canadians . 
That is reprehensible . 
Second , does the hon. member feel that this proposed tax relief would actually lower the price of gasoline for consumers ? 
Would they actually get the benefit of this ? 
We hear from a lot of different so-called economists in this House who say that to provide tax relief will create jobs . 
More workers will be hired , there will be more investment , it will stimulate the economy and it will also be reflected in the consumer pricing , which everybody can then enjoy .  We do not see that . 
My belief is that we will see a very few people benefit from this , mostly shareholders , many of whom do not even reside in this country . 
Third , we know that the Minister of the Environment has a plan for Kyoto . 
There is a series of things dealing with renewable energy sources . 
I want to hear the hon. member 's perspective . 
My understanding is that a lot of the money for Kyoto will go to marketing the government 's plan as opposed to providing the tools to get those renewable energy sources to consumers , to the people on the streets . 
My understanding is that significant resources will actually be spent on marketing the government 's plan . 
Mr. Joe Comartin : 
Madam Speaker , I wish to thank my colleague from Windsor West for his questions . 
I will try to deal with them as efficiently as I can . 
The vote on Bill C-325 last night was a tragedy from the perspective that it lost by only three votes .  It was 99 to 96 . 
We were recommending income tax deductions for emergency workers and people who provide emergency services to protect us from fires . 
Most of them come from rural areas . 
The government opposed it . 
Overall there were a number , and I will give them credit for it , of members from the government side who voted in favour . 
It brought us really close but did not quite get us over . 
It is a pittance compared to what we are talking about in Bill C-48 . 
Our estimate is that probably over the first five years of these incentives it will be at least a billion and probably closer to a billion and a half dollars . 
In terms of those emergency workers , I do not know if we would have got up to a few million in terms of the break we were trying to give them and in effect saying to them that as a government , as a Parliament , as their elected leadership in the country , we prize what they were doing for us . 
The message they got yesterday was obviously that we do not . 
We are going to hear if the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance says that he cannot afford the money that has been promised to the provinces for health care when he makes his financial statement in November . 
We look at that and see that we cannot find that $ 2 billion , but we can find this for a very profitable industry . 
We then say to the minister that this industry is a polluter and that it should be paying its share . 
It should not be getting tax breaks . 
On the other hand , the government will say it cannot find money for health and will stick it to the provinces . 
They will have to find ways to deal with all the health problems that have been specifically created as the result of the burning of fossil fuels . 
It is terrible policy making on the part of the government . 
As for the consumers getting the money , it is obvious they will not . 
There have been any number of other times when these tax breaks have been given and incentives provided , but did we see a reduction to our cost at the gas pump or the cost of home heating fuel ? 
The obvious answer was , no . 
We did not get any of those breaks . 
The government stayed with the companies with their high-paid executives and money going to the shareholders . 
On Kyoto and the marketing issue , I am really happy to hear that question because I have not had the opportunity to raise it in the House . 
We had the Kyoto announcement of spending about a billion dollars at a press conference attended by the Prime Minister , the Minister of Industry and the Minister of the Environment . 
We have this retrofit program .  The government has set aside $ 75 million . 
Everybody in the country who knows anything about it has told the government it is nowhere near enough . 
It also set aside $ 45 million to educate Canadians . 
That is an insult to Canadians . 
Canadians led the fight dragging and kicking the government behind it to finally ratify Kyoto . 
We had people in the country in the ratio of 65 % to 75 % saying they were convinced that we had to ratify Kyoto and they finally got the government to do it . 
Now , is the government going to tell them what they have to do to implement around retrofit programs in their own homes and conservation ? 
They do not need the education . 
This is going to be another one of those boondoggles . 
It is going to be money going to the friends of the government to run absolutely useless education programs , promotional programs for conservation and doing retrofitting . 
It is not necessary . 
The dollars that need to be spent on that are probably a small percentage of the $ 45 million that has been set aside . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Madam Speaker , I must say that I am a little surprised to hear the comments from my colleagues in the New Democratic Party caucus and to hear their expressions of virulent opposition to this bill . 
I can assure hon. members that the hundreds of thousands of people who work in the resource sector , the working people , and the people the NDP always talk about , will benefit from this bill . 
They are employed and have good lifetime jobs because of the resource sector , including people who live in my constituency . 
One of the reasons why the New Democratic Party has increasingly fallen out of favour with its traditional constituency , and one of the reasons it has half the support it did historically , is because when it comes to issues like this , it is constantly against the job creators who employ the working families on whose behalf it claims to speak . 
I find it interesting that the NDP government in Saskatchewan , which yesterday called an election , strongly supports the equalization of taxation for the resource sector because the Saskatchewan treasury , economy , and working families depend on that industry . 
Tens of thousands of jobs in Saskatchewan are dependent on the oil and gas companies , these evil , profitable companies that take risks , invest capital , use technology and ingenuity to help extract resources in an environmentally friendly way , and create wealth in the process . 
Why is it that the NDP here is stalling this bill , by voting against this bill , while the NDP in Saskatchewan , now facing an election , would like to see it passed in order to equalize tax treatment and not have two tier tax discrimination against the people who work in the resource sector and keep this economy going ? 
Mr. Joe Comartin : 
Madam Speaker , let me take a shot first at the Alliance in terms of where we are in the polls in our support in this country . 
We are certainly several percentage points higher than that party and it is going in the opposite direction . 
I have no problem standing up in this House and saying that I will defend the workers . 
The member 's party is not going to do that . 
This industry has already cost this country 80,000 jobs of which 20,000 were directly from this industry , high paying union jobs , however , 60,000 over the last decade and a half were in small employers who ran gas stations and did other things that were related to this industry . 
The industry put those workers out on the street . 
These people did not get any of these tax breaks . 
They did not get any use out of these tax incentives . 
That is what is happening with this money . 
It is what will happen with this tax break that the industry is about to be given . 
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik . 
I am delighted to enter into this debate . 
Listening to the member for Windsor -- St. Clair , the points that he put forward are about as enlightened as a tunnel in a coal mine . 
I look forward to the day when our former Liberal colleague will again represent the riding of Windsor -- St. Clair in the House of Commons and will bring forward some good ideas . 
Canada 's economy is in transition . 
The part of the economy that is dominated by the natural resources economy is shrinking significantly . 
We have many other industries that are blossoming and that is an excellent sign that our government is properly encouraging the development of these industries : high tech sectors , telecommunications , the transportation sector , and information technology . 
These are all great developments , but we need to understand that our natural resource sector is still the bedrock of our economy , employing thousands and thousands of Canadians . 
In fact , if we look at the mining industry , one in eight of our export dollars comes from metals and ores .  This is employing people across Canada . 
We have Diavik Diamond Mines in Yellowknife that are developing now and employing 500 people . 
We have the Voisey 's Bay development that will employ a significant number of people . 
These mining companies are acting in a responsible way . 
They go through the process of due diligence with aboriginal peoples and the environmental issues . 
This is creating a huge amount of jobs and economic activity in Canada . 
In fact , our reserves are really under-exploited , so there will be a need to continue to support our mining sector . 
This bill would equalize the tax treatment for the oil and gas and the mining sectors compared to the other segments of our economy . 
In budget 2000 the government reduced the corporate tax rate from 28 % to 21 % and it left out the mining and oil and gas industries because they had some special provisions . 
The government consulted and has brought back this bill to create the level playing field . 
The intent , as I understood it , was to make it revenue neutral for the oil and gas and the mining sector or perhaps give it somewhat of a lift .  The bill does that . 
It is good for the oil and gas industry . 
It is good for the potash industry in Saskatchewan .  It is good for the junior mining companies , but there is a significant part of the mining industry that is not going to benefit from these provisions .  In fact , they are going to be negatively impacted . 
The reason for that is twofold .  In reaching this accommodation to move the statutory rate from 28 % to 21 % , the government is phasing out the resource allowance and allowing for the deductibility of mining and oil and gas royalties . 
In the base metal sector of the mining economy , some of these resource allowances were in excess of the amounts that it was paying in royalties . 
To compensate partly for that , the government introduced the 10 % exploration mining tax credit . 
That , by the way , will create more exploration in Canada .  That will create exploration jobs in Canada and ultimately that exploration will discover more commercial reserves which will generate even more future employment in Canada . 
Even with the 10 % mining tax credit , that does not do enough for the base metal sector of the mining industry . 
We had representations at the House of Commons finance committee from the Mining Association of Canada . 
It argued that there are eight or nine large companies across Canada that are not going to reap the benefit of these measures . 
In fact , they are going to be negatively impacted . 
There were amendments introduced to increase the exploration tax credit from 10 % to 20 % . 
Those amendments were defeated and so we are here at third reading . 
I will certainly be supporting the bill in general because it is a much needed bill , but as a government we need to deal with this anomaly that has arisen for the base metal sector of the mining industry . 
I am sure our government will be reviewing its particular circumstances over the next many months and , hopefully , there will be a way to deal with this unfair anomaly in the next budget . 
I certainly hope we can do that because this industry is very important to Canada . 
We can talk about high tech , we can talk about information technology and all the sectors that are growing and taking a larger share of our economic pie , but we are still natural resource economy in transition and we need to ensure that our mining industry is healthy and that it can compete internationally . 
In fact at this precise moment the prices of ores and minerals are at a 15 year low . 
That is complicating those competitive factors for our mining industry . 
There is a huge lead time with the mining industry from the time an exploration is started , to the time some discoveries or potential discoveries located , to time the mine is dug , the infrastructure is put in place and the metals are finally extracted . 
We need to understand that is a unique circumstance in which the mining industry finds itself . 
By increasing the exploration tax credit we will provide additional incentive for these companies to seek out new reserves and ultimately create more jobs for Canadians . 
There is another challenge that I should point out . 
There is concern that by eliminating the resource allowance this will create some windfall gain situations for a number of provinces . 
I am sure the Minister of Finance will make his view known to the other provinces that they should reduce their tax burden accordingly . 
In other words , they should allocate that windfall gain back to the mining sector so it is on an even footing or it is revenue neutral in that sense . 
However , we do not have any guarantees of that . 
If we look at the province of Ontario , we have a new premier who is on the record as saying that there will be no corporate tax reductions . 
We could end up in a situation where there is a windfall for the province of Ontario because a significant number of mining companies operate in northern Ontario predominantly . 
They would end up with an increased tax burden because provinces like Ontario would not deal with the windfall in the way it was intended . 
The member for Windsor -- St. Clair comes from an urban riding . 
I do not imagine there are many mines in operation in Windsor . 
There are not many in operation either in Etobicoke North , in my riding . 
However , we need to remember that this economic activity in our natural resource economy creates jobs in our urban centres as well . 
We sometimes easily forget that . 
If we look at the city of Toronto , Bay Street does a lot of the financing . 
A lot goes on in Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver . 
There is a huge amount of economic activity in job creation in our urban centres . 
I should remind members of the House it is economic activity that is done in a responsible way . 
This work is being done in our rural parts of Canada in our natural resource sector . 
In summary , I would encourage members to support the bill . 
We tried to get an amendment at committee , which did not pass . 
However , I hope the government takes it under advisement , meets with the members of the base metal industry , which will be negatively impacted , and comes forward with something in the budget . 
I would also encourage our government , through the Minister of Finance , to get the message through to the provinces that any windfall gain experienced by them as a result of this bill , they should introduce measures to allocate that windfall gain to the mining sector so at least this part of the package is revenue neutral . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Madam Speaker , we all know in the House , as well as in other provincial and municipal governments , decisions have to be made about what we want to focus on , how we want to progress , what we want to spend our resources and then set the conditions for the future . 
I know the member for Etobicoke North is from Ontario like myself . 
We have the highest amount of smog days . 
Smog days kill people and cause respiratory diseases in people . 
In my community we have some of the highest birth defects and all kinds of different cancers because of environmental contaminants . 
There is not enough money available to remedy this . 
My private member 's motion , which was defeated this week , dealt with creating a trigger to investigate , with an open process , some of the problems we faced because of the use of these energy products . 
We have decided that we will use them and that is fine , but at the same time we have an almost hopeless situation of the resources that go back . 
We know the passage of this legislation is going to cost of $ 1.25 billion over five years . 
Would the member rather see that money go to health care and to create clean , renewable energy sources so people in his constituency can breathe , or would he prefer to have a tax cut for oil and gas companies ? 
Mr. Roy Cullen : 
Madam Speaker , I appreciate the comments and the question from the member for Windsor West , but we are confusing the issues . 
In Toronto many of my constituents are concerned about air quality , as am I. I hope the new premier in Ontario will accelerate the phase-out of these coal-fired burners . 
By the same token , we need to be concerned of course with alternative energy . 
In fact Canada 's oil and gas companies are looking at renewable energy and we should be supporting and providing incentives for that type of behaviour , and we are , either at the consumer end or the producer end . 
At the same time , we cannot turn our backs on our natural resource economy , which is creating and maintaining thousands of jobs in Canada . 
We can insist that they be environmentally responsible , and they are . 
However to just say that we should not support our mining , oil and gas sectors in Canada because we have these concerns about Kyoto and the environment does not add up , it does not make sense and it is not logical . 
It should not be supported by the Canadian public and I am sure it will not be in the House . 
Mr. Brian Masse : 
Madam Speaker , this is not about not supporting those workers and industries . 
We can look at the closure of the Petro-Canada refining station in Oakville as one specific example . 
It has chosen not to upgrade the plant .  Instead it has chosen to produce dirty gas until 2005 , then import gas from Europe and brand it with its own company flag . 
That will throw people out of work in the Toronto area . 
Not upgrading that plant will subject them to poor environmental conditions until 2005 . 
The government , because it is a 20 % shareholder in Petro-Canada , has done nothing about this . 
It will benefit by $ 1.5 million . 
Would the member agree that benefit should go to the workers or to make Petro-Canada upgrade its facility so people living around his area do not have to breathe in those pollutants because it refuses to upgrade its plant ? 
Mr. Roy Cullen : 
Madam Speaker , I am not aware of the specifics of that event in Oakville , but we could turn the argument around and say that maybe the reason they are closing the plant is because we have not had a tax policy environment in Canada that supports them . 
However , not being familiar with the case , I am not going to promote that argument too strongly . 
We need to be careful in our thinking . 
We cannot penalize an industry or a company because of some actions they are taking and not be supportive and creative in the way we create a business environment where they can grow responsibly and create jobs and economic activity in Canada . 
Mr. Guy St-Julien ( Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I am honoured to speak on behalf of everyone in my riding , of the miners , mining companies and small mining businesses throughout the vast territory of Abitibi-Témiscamingue , Chapais-Chibougamau and James Bay , and on behalf of the James Bay Cree and the Inuit in Nunavik . 
The riding covers about 850,000 square kilometres in Quebec and is the biggest mining riding in Canada . 
I listened to the Bloc Quebecois member who said that noboby had had spoken out . 
I find this passing strange , because I have documents from the finance minister dated February 2002 . 
It is the answer of the hon. member for LaSalle -- Émard to one of my letters . 
Back in 2002 , I asked for a reduction in the general tax rate of mining companies . 
We knew that the tax rate for small businesses was supposed to drop from 28 % in 2000 to 21 % in 2004 . 
This goes to show that we are concerned about the same issues . 
Coming back to the mining industry , a story by Juliane Pilon was published in La Dépêche , a paper belonging to Jacques Aylwin , under the title `` Decline in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue mining industry '' .  It said that rates go up , then go down , and may well remain low . 
That is what we should be promoting . 
The Mining Association of Canada wrote us to enlist our support for an amendment to Bill C-48 . 
I note , however , that none of the proposed amendments has been adopted and the Bloc Quebecois did not get anywhere in committee . 
The Liberal member who spoke earlier has summarized the entire situation very well as far as what the mining association was calling for is concerned . 
The same thing is happening back home .  If , however , we examine the facts , we know that the federal government is proposing a new rate : 5 % , then 7%,10 % , 10 % and 10 % until 2007 . 
The mining association asked us to support 20 % . 
I listened carefully to the Bloc Quebecois member for Joliette , who said that they too support the Mining Association of Canada . 
What I find strange is that this is not what they proposed in the standing committee . 
Their proposal was 10 % the first year , followed by 14 % the second , and 20 % thereafter . 
I find it odd that the Bloc Quebecois did not call for 20 % right off the bat , instead of going from 10 % to 14 % and finally to 20 % . 
Some hon. members : Oh , oh . 
The people trying to interrupt me ought to ask themselves this : How much is it going to cost the taxpayer ? 
We know that year one will cost about $ 100 million , and the others $ 35 million . 
It will come close to $ 1 billion , all told . 
I understand that this is not firearms , or sponsorships , but money is important . 
We know that , if the government sits down with the Mining Association of Canada in the nest few years , it can come to the House of Commons with an order in council to improve it . 
This is a start , a half-measure compared to the Bloc Quebecois proposal , of 10 % only the first year , not 20 % . 
This sets the facts straight , and it is important to do so , because no amendment has yet been proposed . 
I support the bill because we must not lose it . 
We must at least gain what the government is proposing . 
It is new , and important . 
A careful examination of the record will show that we have always supported the Mining Association of Canada , the Quebec Mining Association , and the prospectors of Quebec . 
Bill C-48 will impact small mining operations and major mining companies differently . 
The small mining companies are resource extraction industries that do not do any mining exploration . 
This is a grey area , as it were , because some small companies operating a mine could still be considered small mining companies . 
Five percent is a good start , even if we would have liked to get 20 % . 
We are going to work in that direction with this Minister of Finance and with the next one . 
As to the present situation in the mining sector , the fiscal aspect is not the only important thing to consider . 
I just received a report dated September 2003 concerning the mining industry in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue area . 
I hope that the Bloc members have a copy of it handy because it is the last document that we have received . 
It is a document written by Luc Blanchette , a well-known economist from the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region , explaining what is happening in that sector . 
The fiscal angle is not everything . 
We know how important the mining industry is for the economy of Abitibi-Témiscamingue , of the whole northern region and of Nunavik . 
We also know the economic and environmental context in which it is operating . 
Moreover , the low prices of metals have caused the temporary closure of some mines or the postponement of some mining projects . 
We all know what is happening now . 
Some mines are closing and others are opening .  New projects are being developed . 
But what can we , together with the opposition members , do in the long term ? 
The revival and mineral exploration in northern Quebec , in Nunavik and in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region will come about through better defined mining zones , mapping and the search for economical sites . 
The investments made in 2003 will no doubt depend on the price of the metals in demand and will certainly be influenced by the price of gold and , as we know , the diamond situation . 
What matters most are the consequences of that politico-economical context , which have been apparent since 1988 . 
They did not suddenly crop up today because of Bill C-48 . 
The very first year , instead of accepting 10 % or 14 % , the Bloc Quebecois should have asked that we follow up on what the Mining Association of Canada had requested and that we go for 20 % . 
They too accepted a halfway compromise . 
When this government came to power , the amount was already down to 5 % . 
Among the consequences that we have seen since 1988 , there is a 46 % decline in labour and a 44 % decrease in the number of hours paid by the mining industry in Abitibi-Témiscamingue . 
We know that , in Quebec , although the impact on employment was still significant , it was not as great , with a 33 % reduction in the number of hours paid and the number of employees . 
Given that approximately 20 % of all mining operations in Quebec take place in Abitibi-Témiscamingue , the decrease observed at the provincial level is probably due to the poor performance of the regional mining industry . 
What do we do now ? 
I will be supporting Bill C-48 . 
I come from a mining area and I used to be a miner myself . 
It is good to have gained something . 
It is also something new . 
Reducing the tax rate applicable to corporations was not an issue before . 
But it is important , just as it is for the corporations to set up their headquarters in our region instead of Montreal or Toronto , where they are currently located . 
We have to work with the current government and the governments to come to find solutions and improve the situation . 
We will see how things go in year one of the implementation of this bill , which provides for rates of 5 % , 7 % and 10 % for the next five years . 
These rates could increase in every budget . 
In the next budget , the government might raise it to 10 % , as the Bloc Quebecois asked for in committee . 
It could happen . 
We just have to wait and see . 
What is important right now is to help our mining companies . 
Some companies are closing down in our region and more could do so in Abitibi-Témiscamingue in the months to come . 
We need to go forward , work hard and work together . 
We cannot have our cake and eat it too , and the picture drawn by the renowned economist , Mr. Blanchette , reflects the real situation in the mining industry . 
Members of Parliament do not create jobs . 
It is important also to think about the miners who work underground . 
The PQ government never agreed to set up a retirement plan for miners . 
If we can introduce tax credits for mineral exploration activities , then we should be able to help the miners who work underground . 
The PQ made that promise during the 1973 election campaign , but never kept it . 
The government should address this issue and think about setting up a pension plan for miners who need it when mines close down . 
Ms. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) : 
Madam Speaker , Bill C-48 has been under review for a long time and witnesses have appeared before the committee , representatives from the mining industry , among others . 
The most frustrating thing about this bill is that it gives $ 250 million to the major oil companies . 
When the mining associations appeared before the Standing Committee on Finance to talk about their problems and needs , I am sorry to say that the members for Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik and for Témiscamingue were not there . 
Today it is all well and good to -- 
Mr. Guy St-Julien : Madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
Order , please . 
I believe the member has not -- 
Mr. Guy St-Julien : 
Oh , oh . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
Order , please .  First , I have not yet given you the floor . 
Second , I imagine that the member for Drummond is going to ask her question . 
At that point , you will have time to answer . 
The hon. member for Drummond . 
Ms. Pauline Picard : 
Madam Speaker , I wanted to mention that we have met with mining association representatives . 
They informed us of what they need . 
They also gave their recommendations for this bill . 
They are very worried because they are being discriminated against relative to the major oil companies , for instance . 
They proposed two amendments that we submitted to the standing committee , including the amendment that the member for Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik is talking about . 
This amendment had also been proposed by a Liberal member ; these two amendments , that of the Bloc and that of the Liberal member , were rejected . 
That said , we cannot be accused of not having done our work . 
I would like to know what he thinks ; he still maintains that he is going to vote in favour of the bill , while the mining associations , in particular those in his area , are asking us to vote against it . 
I would like to hear what the member has to say about this . 
Mr. Guy St-Julien : 
Madam Speaker , I wanted to raise a point of order on a matter of interpretation . 
The hon. member said we were not there , at committee . 
That is incorrect . 
We cannot be everywhere at once , and there are many committees of the House of Commons . 
Often , Bloc Quebecois members travel around the world and cannot attend committee . 
We do not mention it in the House . 
They are travelling . 
I am the only member not to have travelled abroad . 
I want to make that perfectly clear . 
The hon. member mentioned the $ 250 million for oil companies . 
Well , let us talk about oil and this $ 250 million . 
There are two provinces in Canada with an energy authority These authorities set the floor price for oil . 
We cannot talk about oil without talking about the people who put regular gas in their vehicles . 
As we know , recently in Ottawa , gasoline has been selling for 66.4¢ per litre , while in the Abitibi , it is selling for 74.9¢ ; in Kuujjuaq , regular gas is selling for $ 1.22 per litre . 
Who established an energy authority for oil in Quebec ? 
The PQ did , when it was in office . 
It should not have . 
It should have gone the way of the free market instead . 
Our gasoline price would be closer to Ontario 's 66.4¢ , instead of 74.9¢ . 
Let us look at the bill as it stands . 
The Bloc Quebecois contends that we did not adopt the amendments put forward . 
There are no amendments before the House at this time . 
Bill C-48 is . 
We all have respect for the Quebec Mining Association , the Mining Association of Canada and prospectors . 
We win some and we lose some ; it is 50-50 . 
But the hon. member mentioned rates . 
The Bloc said , `` We support the mining association for 20 % '' . 
That is incorrect ; what the Bloc proposed was 10 % , then 14 % and 20 % thereafter . 
They should switch gears , because we are not debating amendments today . 
I support the legislation in order to get at least 50 % . 
Mr. Louis Plamondon ( Bas-Richelieu -- Nicolet -- Bécancour , BQ ) : 
Madam Speaker , I will be very brief . 
I would like to ask a question to my colleague . 
For example , if the member for LaSalle -- Émard , who owns a fleet of ships , paid his taxes in Canada instead of in the Bahamas , would this help the mining industry ? 
Mr. Guy St-Julien : 
Madam Speaker , the member for LaSalle -- Émard has always paid his taxes in Canada . 
The member for LaSalle -- Émard , personally , has always paid his taxes in Quebec . 
I find it strange that the member is attacking a member who has a very good reputation in Canada .  I also find it strange that he does not dare to tell us about the opinion on the Abitibi-Témiscamingue mining industry that was prepared by an economist in September 2003 . 
These members do not even know what is happening in our area . 
Ms. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) : 
Madam Speaker , that really takes the cake . 
This is the second time that I speak on this bill , so I know it . 
I also know it because I took part in the work of the committee and in the clause by clause study . 
Despite the progress that has been made , Bill C-48 is still unacceptable to us , in the Bloc Quebecois . 
The main irritant in this bill is nothing less than the $ 250 million gift the Liberal government and the future leader of that party are on the verge of giving to major oil companies . 
People who are watching us must fully understand what the bill means . 
The government wants to provide a $ 250 million tax cut to Canadian oil companies . 
This is an untimely gift , since we read in the newspapers yesterday that the current Minister of Finance is warning the provinces that they will not receive the health funds that they were expecting from the federal government . 
Today , the same minister is saying that he will not put one cent more into the equalization system . 
The Minister of Finance has started to set the stage for the economic update that he will be tabling next month . 
How can the Minister of Finance talk about situations that have had a bearing on the economic performance of his government , while at the same time supporting a bill that would mean much less money flowing in the consolidated revenue fund ? 
What are the Liberal government 's real intentions ? 
There is no money to finance health care in the provinces , but there is money to give to the oil companies . 
This two-headed government does not have priorities anymore or rather its priorities are not the same as those of Quebec and the other provinces . 
Why is the Minister of Finance not giving Quebec the financial instruments that it needs to carry out its responsibilities ? 
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , the great provincialist , said earlier this week : 
The Government of Canada is doing its best to help the provinces live through difficult times . 
The best his government can do seems rather limited . 
In fact , it only does its best when it is a question of continuingg to build a centralizing government that is literally crushing the other governments within Confederation . 
Such an attitude is an argument for rejecting Confederation in favour of Quebec sovereignty . 
The Liberal government in Ottawa is willing to give a gift worth $ 250 million to the oil companies , which rack up huge profits , while it is hinting that it might not have enough money to give to the provinces for health care as promised . 
Such arrogance is beyond words . 
If the Liberal government goes ahead with its plan , Quebec stands to lose $ 472 million . 
Investing in health care benefits Quebeckers and Canadians as a whole . 
On the other hand , Bill C-48 will only benefit oil companies . 
There is no sense of proportion . 
I hope that the member for Témiscamingue , the member for Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik , or both , will understand that by voting in favour of this bill they are going against the best interest of their regions . 
The comments made Tuesday in the House by the Minister of Finance on Bill C-48 are not consistent . 
During question period , the minister said that he had to deal with a slowdown in the Canadian economy . 
How then can he agree to forfeit $ 250 million in revenues ? 
The Liberal government , both the current government and the parallel government headed by the member for LaSalle -- Émard , is financially strangling the provinces . 
That way , they give themselves leeway to then invest in areas under provincial jurisdiction . 
The provinces are bled white , forced to their knees , and money is rammed down their throat to meet the needs of their people . 
Then the government creates programs , lots of programs , and eventually withdraws from them . 
This is how it has been since 1993 when I first came here . 
That is how this government behaves . 
It creates programs and interferes in areas of provincial jurisdiction . 
It creates needs , and then it withdraws . 
This is what I call arrogance . 
All of the provinces are headed for a deficit . 
Liberals can criticize the PQ 's management , but the facts speak for themselves . 
The PQ was not the government in Manitoba , British Columbia or Ontario . 
Yet , these provinces are running a deficit . 
Liberals should change their tune or find new speech writers . 
By providing a tax reduction for an industry that does not need it , Bill C-48 shows how leeway the government has . 
While Liberals in Ottawa give to the rich , they continue to take from the taxpayers . 
This is further evidence of the existence of a fiscal imbalance . 
However , the people across the way continue to deny it . 
The intergovernmental affairs minister , the finance minister and all those yes men sitting on the back benches continue to deny the existence of a fiscal imbalance . 
There actually is a fiscal imbalance , and it is a brutal reality . 
We can see its impact throughout the country . 
The Bloc Quebecois has been condemning this situation for quite some time , whatever certain reporters claim . 
The PQ also did it in Quebec City , the ADQ also recognized this reality and the whole civil society agreed with the Government of Quebec . 
The best part of all this , however , is that sovereignists on one side , and Jean Charest 's provincialists on the other , agree to condemn the fiscal imbalance . 
The current Liberal finance minister of Quebec , Yves Séguin , headed a commission that came to the conclusion that there was a fiscal imbalance and that it had existed for years . 
When the Liberals were elected in Quebec , they tried to convince the public that things would change and that relations would improve . 
It was total hogwash . 
The fact of the matter is that a change in leadership , whether in Quebec City or in Ottawa , will do no good . 
The would be leader or parallel prime minister continues to deny the existence of a fiscal imbalance . 
The Bloc has always taken an active part in parliamentary debates , and it also makes every effort to properly inform the public about all issues . 
Today 's newspapers have published a letter on Bill C-48 signed by my colleagues for Rosemont-Petite-Patrie and Joliette . 
If I may , I would like to quote excerpts : 
Since 1970 , the federal government has contributed more than $ 66 billion in direct grants to the hydrocarbon industry ( oil , gas and coal ) , notably with the Quebec taxpayers ' dollars . 
This huge sum of money has allowed Alberta and Ontario to develop highly polluting oil and coal industries . 
In the meantime , Quebec developed its hydroelectric network , a type of clean energy , and did not receive a dime from Ottawa . 
This is just one more example of how Ottawa ignores Quebec 's interests . 
But now , In addition to harming Quebec 's interests , the help Ottawa has provided the oil industry goes against both the spirit and the letter of the Kyoto protocol , as well as its objectives . 
That is what the Liberals and the member for LaSalle -- Émard have done by voting for Bill C-48 , a bill that provides a $ 250 million tax break to Canada 's major oil companies . 
After debate at second reading , an article in the Ottawa Citizen on October 1 condemned the hypocrisy of this government , which , on the one hand , supports the Kyoto protocol and boasts about making the environment one of its priorities while , on the other hand , it blithely supports the development of polluting energies . 
I will paraphrase what Matthew Bramley , an environmentalist with the Pembina Institute , was quoted in the Ottawa Citizen as saying that , to be truly equitable , `` you'd make the polluting sectors pay more to compensate for the damage they do '' . 
Instead , we have a government that wants to reduce the burden for the oil industry , which is an attitude , understandably , that will be well received by Albertans . 
Mr. Bramley predicts that the new Liberal leader will not change anything , since he will need to entice voters from the west . 
I have a number of questions and I would like to hear what the member for LaSalle -- Émard has to say . 
How can the Liberals and their future leader claim to be concerned about the environment and , in the same breath , make sure that the big oil companies enjoy such advantages , while this industry is drowning in profits and ravaging the environment ? 
Why is that $ 250 million per year not being offered to the wind power or hydroelectric industries , which produce clean energy ? 
I am eager to see the member for LaSalle -- Émard come out of his burrow to answer our questions . 
There are more urgent things to do than organizing parties with his supporters and there are issues on which he should speak . 
The public ought to understand what an immense slump it is going to find itself in , with a future prime minister whose decisions have a direct effect on the bank accounts of his businesses . 
Bill C-48 is an illustration of the patent conflict of interest in which the member for LaSalle -- Émard finds himself . 
One of his companies carries coal ; it works with the petroleum industry . 
Worse still , the future prime minister is himself a stockholder in an Alberta oil company . 
That is too much . 
I hope that the hon. members on the benches opposite will wake up and see reason . 
I talked very little about the consequences of this legislation on the mining industry . 
This bill does not treat mining companies equitably and undermines the Government of Quebec 's efforts to revitalize this industry . 
This should worry the people of Abitibi-Témiscamingue , a mining region that just elected a Liberal member who voted in favour of legislation that directly contradicts the interests of his own region . 
This should worry those who think that a Liberal member in Ottawa can defend Quebec 's interests . 
In fact , the Bloc Quebecois is defending Quebec 's interests in Ottawa , whereas the Liberals are defending Ottawa 's interests in Quebec . 
Bill C-48 is proof of that . 
Representatives of the mining industry came before the Standing Committee on Finance to express their opposition to this legislation . 
Pierre Gratton , the Vice-President of Public Affairs and Communications for the Mining Association of Canada , indicated that several provinces had established their tax rates according to the federal system implemented in 1974 . 
He said that this bill will increase the taxes of certain companies . 
We heard the comments of Frédéric Quintal , spokesman for Essence à juste prix , who told the committee that : 
With this accumulated debt of over $ 500 billion , can our government afford a tax gift to the richest industry in Canada ? 
We are not talking here of an industry in difficulty , not the Canadian beef , softwood lumber or airline industry , but the richest industry . 
Then , in response to our questions in connection with what he said about the tax relief to the companies never making it down to the pumps , and thus having no effect for consumers , he added : 
No , it will just mean additional profits or the oil and gas companies , three of whom -- Esso , Shell and Petro Canada -- have in the first six months of 2003 already gone 242 % over the net profits for the entire year , twelve months , of 1999 .  And that was already considered a very good year .  I feel I must point this out . 
So that is the situation . 
On the one hand , we have a government complaining about having to bear the brunt of an economic downturn , which allows it to continue to maintain a stranglehold on the provincial governments , while on the other hand we have that same government wanting to give a tax break to the huge , and hugely wealthy , oil and gas companies . 
In conclusion , since this bill is not in the best interests of the entire community ; since this bill blocks the efforts being made by Quebec to make mining investment more attractive ; since this bill moves us far away from the principles of the Kyoto protocol as far as environmental protection is concerned ; since this bill ipaves the way for the parallel prime minister to win over the west , I , as a Quebecker , a member of a party defending the interests of Quebec in this House , and a sovereignist , am opposed to this bill . 
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont -- Petite-Patrie , BQ ) : 
Madam Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I listened to my colleague from Drummond . 
She spoke rather eloquently to a number of aspects of Bill C-48 . 
I am thinking in particular of the fact that this bill reconfirms and renews the Canadian policy of financing the oil and gas industry in Canada . 
This $ 250 million exemption for the oil industry only confirms what was announced . 
We must remember that throughout Canadian history , major oil companies have received substantial benefits and funding for structuring development projects . 
Just think of the Hibernia project in eastern Canada , which was developed using the taxes of Quebeckers in a polluting sector , when the hydroelectric system in Quebec was developed using the taxes of Quebeckers , and only theirs . 
No funding came from Ottawa .  At the same time , Ottawa was funding polluting projects and granting exemptions to the oil industry . 
That is totally unacceptable . 
I am having a hard time understanding certain members opposite . 
I am thinking of the hon. member for Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik , among others , who is supposed to be defending the interests of the regions , his region and riding in particular ; he can see that , indirectly , this bill is very unfair to the mining industry . 
In this respect , I question the sense of duty , responsibility and commitment of some parliamentarians in this House , whose sole duty -- especially as MPs representing the regions , and remote regions in particular -- is to defend the interests of their regions . 
Some members do not even stand up in debates as important as this one , and will very likely vote in favour of Bill C-48 . 
We have a duty in this House , and this duty is to , at the very least , condemn the lack of responsibility of colleagues who think they are defending the interests of their ridings . 
I would therefore like to know what my. hon. colleague thinks of these Liberal members who are supposed to represent the interests of Quebec , at least they often claim to be defending the interests of their region ; yet they are about to vote in favour of a bill that creates unacceptable inequities affecting industry sectors such as mining while they sit there and say nothing . 
The only time they will stand up in the House will be to vote for Bill C-48 . 
What does she think of the attitude of these members ? 
Ms. Pauline Picard : 
Madam Speaker , I thank my colleague from Rosemont -- Petite-Patrie for this additional information . 
I wanted to point out to him that I too am outraged . 
I am especially outraged today because , to clean up the mess and to obscure the issue , the Liberals try to intervene and to say : `` No , we will vote in favour of the bill . 
The government may come up with something and may do this , but what the Bloc says is not totally true '' . 
What I said in my speech has been confirmed several times . 
I mentioned people , representatives from the mining industry , editorial writers , people in whom the public has great confidence because they are honest people who came to tell the truth . 
Yet , the Liberals are trying to make us believe that the Bloc is not right . 
No wonder I am outraged . 
People like us work 10 , 12 or 14 hours a day listening to witnesses in committees , analyzing bills and doing research in order to help and support our population . 
We always have the public 's best interests in mind . 
They are trying to tell us that we are wrong , that we did not do this or that . 
I will not stand for it . 
It is ridiculous . 
If members had really wanted to support their region with this bill , the very least they could have done is meet with the representatives of the mining associations to hear what we heard . 
They are against the bill . 
They feel the legislation is unfair . 
Furthermore , there is another irritant , and the public needs to know this ; nobody has said a word about the $ 250 million that is being granted to the highly polluting oil companies . 
As my colleague the member for Rosemont -- Petite-Patrie said , why do we not take that money and invest it in some less polluting form of energy ? 
The major oil companies do not need any money . 
They make huge profits . 
The government just granted them a $ 250 million tax credit . 
They have received a total of $ 500 million this year . 
This is taxpayers ' money taken from the pockets of Quebeckers and Canadians . 
In top of that , prices keep going up at the pump . 
Now the government is getting ready to give them another gift . 
They received $ 250 million and will receive another $ 250 million so they can pollute even more .  It is absolutely outrageous . 
I do not understand the members for Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik and Témiscamingue who refuse to recognize that their government is giving such a gift to the major oil companies . 
Mr. Guy St-Julien ( Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , when the hon. member talks about the price of gasoline at the pumps , she should also add that , in Quebec , the price at the pumps is set by the Régie de l'énergie , which was created by the PQ government . 
There is a basic price , a floor price , on which no member has a say . 
Quebec has a floor price while its neighbouring provinces rely on the market price . 
I have two questions for the hon. member . 
First , we all agree that she took stock of the requests of the Mining Association of Canada . 
We know that the government is proposing 5 % for the first year , and 7 % and 10 % for the following years . 
The Mining Association of Canada wanted 20 % for the first year . 
Can the hon. member confirm to the House and all Canadian taxpayers that what they proposed was 10 % instead of 5 % for the first year , then 14 % for the second year and 20 % ? 
Has the hon. member for Drummond had the opportunity since September 2003 to go over the report on the mining industry in Abitibi-Témiscamingue prepared by economist Luc Blanchette ? 
It is a very good report . 
We stand by the mining community . 
I am a former miner myself and we will stand by these people in the years to come . 
We will not be able to win all the battles , but we hope to win half of them . 
Unlike some of my colleagues , I do not represent a resource region of 5 or 10 square kilometres , but rather a riding of 800,000 square kilometres . 
I will vote in favour of this bill , because I do not want to lose that 5 % . 
It is 50 % of the 10 % that the hon. member asked for in committee , which was 10 % instead of 20 % . 
She should get her facts straight . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
The hon. member for Drummond has 1 minute and a few seconds to answer . 
Ms. Pauline Picard : 
Madam Speaker , I have to smile . 
What I just heard does not make any sense . 
The member is all mixed up between the 10 % , the 14 % and the 20 % . 
The amendments put forward in the standing committee came directly from the Mining Association of Canada . 
This is where those amendments came from . 
I would also like to remind him that Pierre Gratton , the vice-president for public affairs of the Mining Association of Canada -- hardly a nobody -- said that many provinces had based their taxation level on the federal system implemented in 1974 . 
He also said : `` This bill will increase some companies ' taxes '' . 
The member should not try to sell us this argument . 
Who knows this industry better than Mr. Gratton from the Mining Association of Canada ? 
I repeat what he said : `` This bill will increase some companies ' taxes '' . 
I hope that the people of the Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik and Témiscamingue ridings will remember that their members voted for this bill . 
This bill is harmful to the mining sector and favours the major oil companies . 
Those listening should not forget that the major oil companies have been given a $ 250 million gift . 
Hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , one has to note the enthusiastic and overwhelming support for Bill C-48 by that great philanthropic party , the Canadian Alliance . 
The official opposition is very much inclined to support the bill , as was shown yesterday in the vote at report stage . 
That party is opposed to Kyoto . 
That party by and large is opposed to social security reform . 
That party is opposed to strong federalism . 
The fact that the official opposition supports the legislation is a source of some suspicion . 
We would not want to prejudge it just because the support of the official opposition is there , but there are three very good reasons to reject this legislation and I will outline them one by one . 
Bill C-48 aims at reducing taxes for the oil and gas industry . 
This raises the question , is the industry in trouble and does it need some help ? 
If it were the textile industry , the shoe industry , or some industry in difficulty across the country one would understand , but why apply this form of tax relief to an industry which is consistently posting large profits and is likely to post large profits in the decades ahead ? 
That is the question . 
This brings me to the heart of the first reason . 
The industry has free access to natural resources which are extracted from underground . 
It extracts a resource which belongs to the people of Canada . 
This resource also belongs to the next generation of Canadians , and hopefully to generations to come . 
The time limit available for the exploitation of this resource is not that long . 
In return for this free resource the industry pays taxes . 
Those taxes go into the system that permits governments to do the good things that they do for the public from pensions to airports to other services which keep this country together and functioning . 
Bill C-48 would reduce the taxation rate from 28 % to 21 % . 
The present rate of 28 % has been justified over the years as a form of payment by this industry to the Canadian public . 
The idea of reducing the taxation rate from 28 % to 21 % is a good reason why the bill should not be supported . 
The tax rate should not be reduced . 
There is another reason and it can be spelled out in one very short word . 
That word is Kyoto .  It is important to briefly explain Kyoto because it has now become a buzzword that implies so much . 
Canada , by virtue of ratifying that accord last December by a vote here in the House , which was opposed by the official opposition but supported by all other parties , is now committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions . 
These are the gases produced when we burn fossil fuels , from petroleum to oil to gas and to coal . 
All the fossil fuels produce gases when burned . 
Canada is committed to a reduction of 6 % by the year 2012 , which actually seems to be very little , based on our emissions in the year 1990 . 
But because of the increase in our economic activity this needed reduction is not just 6 % ; it is estimated by our scientists that we need a reduction in the range of some 23 % to 25 % . 
It is a major undertaking , a major engagement , and not an easy one . 
Therefore , what follows is that if we pass any form of legislation in this House , we would want to pass legislation that facilitates , that makes easier , the achievement of the Kyoto goals . 
Here instead , and this is the second reason for considering this bill not worthy of support , we are putting forward a measure that will make it more difficult to achieve the goals which the Government of Canada has set for itself by way of the ratification of the Kyoto accord last December , by way of a vote in this House of Commons . 
The parliamentary secretary , when he spoke earlier on the bill on behalf of the Minister of Finance , made no reference to Kyoto and how the bill would affect the achievement of Canada 's goal . 
This lack of reference to Kyoto disturbs me very much , because at least an explanation ought to be given as to why this measure is possible in the light of the commitment to the Kyoto ratification and the heavy engagement by Canada in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions . 
This bill instead is introduced as a measure to facilitate this particular industrial sector , with no reference , however , to the overall government commitment . 
For this second reason , and there is a third one , I submit to you that this bill should die in the Senate . 
It should die because it runs counter to and opposes the achievement of a goal set by the Government of Canada and counter to its policy , which was decided by the entire government and by this Parliament by way of the vote I referred to earlier . 
Bill C-48 is an emanation of just one department , the Department of Finance . 
It is not the policy of the Government of Canada as a whole and , since it runs counter to that policy , it ought to be rejected for that reason alone . 
Because as we can see , we have on the one hand the Government of Canada doing the right thing in ratifying the Kyoto protocol . 
It was a good measure .  It was a good decision . 
In addition to that , the Government of Canada is investing over $ 3 billion , as of the year 2000 , toward the implementation of Kyoto in order to achieve that distant and rather difficult goal . 
But then on the other hand , we see here a proposition in this bill that is aimed at reducing taxes on the oil and gas industry . 
This measure makes no sense , because it would stimulate and accelerate emissions of the greenhouse gases we want to reduce in order to achieve the Kyoto objectives . 
Evidently the Department of Finance does not know that a major objective of this government is to cut greenhouse gas emissions . 
Bill C-48 should not , therefore , be allowed to be approved in the other chamber because it is not in the public interest and because it runs counter to a key government policy . 
Now we come to the third reason why the bill should be rejected . 
The reason is related to the depletion of global oil and gas reserves . 
What I am going to relate to everyone in a moment is the result of consultations with the International Energy Agency in Paris , which is an agency devoted to the study of energy and its production and the resources that are available to the global community . 
According to the International Energy Agency , there is a depletion point called the `` mid-depletion point '' of reserves for oil , which is identified at the year 2020 . 
In other words , in about 17 years we will reach the midpoint in the exhaustion of the global oil reserves . 
After that , one may want to ask , how much time is left ? 
We are told by the same International Energy Agency that there are sufficient reserves for another 20 to 25 years .  That brings us to roughly the year 2045 . 
That is when our young pages will be in their mature years ; they will probably have children and they will be looking forward to retirement . 
This is the horizon being described by the International Energy Agency : by the year 2020 we will reach the mid-depletion point for oil and by the year 2045 , roughly , we will exhaust the oil reserves . 
It could be 2050 , but it is impossible to determine at this stage . 
There may be technological breakthroughs , yes , which may extend the depletion point perhaps to the year 2060 , but we are definitely approaching within this century a point when the oil reserves will be depleted and we will reach the last drop of oil , so to speak , for use by mankind of this very valuable resource . 
How does it look for natural gas ? 
We are told that the mid-depletion point is a little better .  It may not be 2020 ; it could be around 2050 . 
But it is not very clear whether this calculation is accurate . 
It could actually be reached sooner rather than later . 
To compress this particular report from the International Energy Agency , what we can say with a degree of certainty is that in about 50 years we will have reached the depletion point for oil as well as for gas , give or take perhaps a few years depending on technological advancement and the ability through technology to use better and more efficiently this specific resource so as to make it last longer . 
That is probably the whole purpose of having efficiency programs and efficiency research in the coming years : to make the resource last not for one or two generations but perhaps three . 
However , as I mentioned earlier , the resource will be exhausted within a few decades . 
Therefore , we have to start planning for that time . 
What is the conclusion , then , from this quick tableau I have painted for members in looking at the future ? 
Looking at the future is always a very dangerous exercise , as we know , because one might be terribly wrong , but I do have to rely on the experts . 
On behalf of the public , we as politicians have to listen to the experts because they are the ones who spend their lifetimes on these matters . 
It seems to me the conclusion would be that if anything we should be slowing down the exploitation of oil and gas resources rather than accelerating it . 
That is the logic of it all . 
We should not do as the official opposition , which is famous for its shortsighted policies , would do . 
We should not accelerate the process and produce more . 
Therefore the bill is out of sync . 
It does not fit into the long term picture that we are trying to come to grips with . 
That is our task as elected officials . 
To conclude , there is also an economic consideration , that is , when we reach the midpoint for gas and oil around 2020 or 2025 , this very same oil and gas will command a higher price on the market than it commands now because the supply will be reduced . 
Therefore , the returns will be greater for future generations if we postpone the exploitation of this resource for their time rather than taking advantage of it now . 
I hope we can see the economic logic of this kind of reasoning . 
There are many reasons converging to force one to conclude that a measure to reduce the taxation of this particular sector is not desirable . 
I will conclude briefly , as my time is up . 
It is therefore in Canada 's interests to exploit carefully its natural resources and to make them last as long as possible . 
In this particular type of industry today , the earnings are high . 
We can see them in the business section of newspapers . 
The profits are also high . 
So then the question arises , why reduce taxes ? 
Why forego a revenue that is estimated by some writers at $ 260 million ? 
Why move in a direction that is counterproductive and out of sync with the overall approach of the Government of Canada ? 
The approach has been a good one , namely , ratifying Kyoto , which is the basic , fundamental and most difficult sustainable development issue we have ever encountered and which is standing before us as a very difficult challenge to overcome . 
Mr. Marcel Gagnon ( Champlain , BQ ) : 
Madam Speaker , I just heard a refreshing speech . 
It is interesting to see that some members on the other side share the views of the member for Davenport . 
I took note of at least four reasons why we should not support this bill . 
I totally agree with the member when he says that we should not grant tax relief to very wealthy and profitable corporations . 
When we are increasingly talking about trying to reduce pollution , we should adopt the polluter pay principle . 
Here we have the reverse : an industry that promotes pollution is being rewarded . 
This is how I see it anyway . 
The member also mentioned the risk of depletion : we will probably face an oil shortage within 20 , 40 or 50 years . 
I believe the Kyoto protocol is an issue he is keenly interested in . 
As we know , developing the oil industry cost Canadians a bundle . 
The oil industry is rumoured to have benefited from $ 66 billion while the hydro electricity industry , especially Hydro-Québec , got nothing . 
Does the member for Davenport not agree that the $ 250 million the government is planning to give the oil industry would be better used if it were invested in clean , renewable energies ? 
Would it not be more logical and safer for our future to promote research on windmills ? 
The member talked about the future of the young pages who are here , the future of the country as a whole . 
In view of the fact that Hydro-Québec never received any development help from the federal government , while the oil industry in western Canada received billions and billions of dollars and is about to receive further handouts , would it not be a good idea to spread the assistance around so that together we can develop cleaner industries and promote fairness for all ? 
Hon. Charles Caccia : 
Madam Speaker , I cannot answer the second question because it pertains to a provincial agency ; I think Hydro-Québec received grants from the Quebec government for a number of years and , therefore , it did not need help from the federal government . 
The same is true for Ontario Hydro . 
The first question from the member for Champlain is very interesting and well thought out because we should of course invest much more in renewable energies . 
I hope the next federal budget will place a greater emphasis on the measures initiated in the 2001 budget . 
They were small steps in that direction and we should redouble our efforts . 
Whatever has been done until now is not enough . 
Mr. Joe Comartin ( Windsor -- St. Clair , NDP ) : 
Madam Speaker , I compliment the member for Davenport , who is also the chair of the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development , on his speech and the rationale he used in speaking against the implementation of provisions that are contained in Bill C-48 . 
I want to pursue the question my colleague from the Bloc just asked but in a somewhat different tangent . 
If one were to use the tax system by way of subsidies and incentives to advance public policy , does the member have any opinion as to how that could be used with regard to the clean burning of the fossil fuel in the form of coal ? 
Does he think that is possible ? 
Does he know of any specific incentives that the government could put into place to encourage either research , development or actual implementation of clean burning coal technology , if that in fact exists in his opinion ? 
Hon. Charles Caccia : 
Madam Speaker , the hon. member for Windsor -- St. Clair is very kind in his remarks and too generous in attributing to me a knowledge on clean coal technology , which I do not possess . 
This firm has been with us for some time . 
A considerable amount of research was conducted in the 1980s , particularly in Nova Scotia , in order to keep our coal mines there open . 
I suppose there are processes available today that claim to achieve clean results . 
I would imagine the thrust of the member 's question would be better addressed to the Minister of Industry in order to establish whether , in the technology research program that he announced as part of his department some 18 months ago , a particular effort is being made toward achieving this particular activity in the field of energy . 
There is no doubt that energy efficiency and energy innovation in particular will be needed to achieve our Kyoto goals but we should also keep in mind that the outcome will not depend just on the technological fix . 
The outcome will also depend on an enormous amount of discipline on the part of ourselves as consumers , an enormous amount of innovation in the field of energy conservation and an enormous amount of initiatives that are crying to heaven for attention . 
We only have to consider the tremendous use of energy by supermarkets at the retail level which are consuming tremendous amounts of energy every day in a manner that is unconscionable at times . 
One only has to go to Europe to see the difference . 
The Europeans conserve their energy very carefully compared to the manner in which we use our energy on this side of the Atlantic . 
Mr. Joe Comartin : 
Madam Speaker , would the member for Davenport agree with me that , if there is this type of technology available , it would be better to have tax incentives going in that direction than the blanket format that is contained in Bill C-48 ? 
Hon. Charles Caccia : 
Madam Speaker , because of time limitation I will say simply , yes . 
Mr. Paul Crête ( Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak on Bill C-48 , which concerns primarily the fiscal arrangements for gas and oil companies . 
In preparing my speech for debate at third reading , I found a very convincing article in the chartered accountants ' magazine by Neil Smith , Senior Tax Manager of the core tax practice with Ernst &amp ; Young in Calgary . 
I just want to read one sentence from this article , which refers to the bill before us : 
The release came on the heels of a significant lobbying effort by the resource sector for federal corporate tax rate reductions . 
Clearly , in relation to this bill , the big winners are the oil and gas companies . 
They have recorded significant profits over the past few years . 
As a result of this legislation , they will be able to pocket even more money since the government has decided to lower their income taxes . 
This is quite mystifying because , at the same time that the Minister of Finance is telling us that he needs money and that he might not be able to provide the provinces with the promised funds for health care , he is giving away $ 250 million in tax cuts to the oil and gas companies . 
Here are a few examples of what the oil and gas companies are experiencing , to prove that they are not living under the poverty line . 
Petro-Canada's quarterly report to shareholders for the second quarter states : 
Petro-Canada announced today second quarter earnings from operations of $ 455 million , which include a positive adjustment of $ 96 million for Canadian income tax rate changes . 
This is an initial impact of this new legislation , because it was implemented by a ways and means motion . 
Petro-Canada has already saved $ 96 million in the first quarter . 
As a result , Petro-Canada's taxes went down by $ 96 million . 
Petro-Canada is not about to go bankrupt ; it does not have a problem with profits . 
The oil and gas sector has recorded phenomenal increases in profits as a result of price increases . 
In early winter 2003 , it was not certain that low-income and middle-income earners would be able to afford home heating oil . 
But Petro-Canada gets a little reduction in income tax worth $ 96 million . 
In the case of Shell Canada , the quarterly report to stockholders for the second quarter , that is , the same period , says this : 
Shell Canada Limited announces second-quarter earnings of $ 178 million .. Earnings included a one-time benefit of $ 54 million from a future income tax revaluation following announced income tax changes . 
In the case of Petro-Canada , there was talk of $ 96 million ; for Shell Canada , it was $ 54 million less in taxes . 
The quarterly report of Esso Imperial , another company that is certainly not suffering , reads as follows for the second quarter of 2003 : 
-- tax rate reductions enacted by the Federal government and the provincial government of Alberta and settlement of various tax matters benefited results , mainly in the resources segment , by $ 109 million . 
Therefore , the three largest oil companies are declaring future additional profits of $ 250 million . 
During this time , there are people who will have trouble paying their basic expenses . 
Today we heard a little good news : the federal government has decided to extend the transitional employment insurance measures for the Lower St. Lawrence and the North Shore . 
It has taken a year of struggle by the Bloc Quebecois to win on this point , which will enable people to have two , three or four additional weeks of benefits . 
As for the oil companies , they do not face this kind of struggle . 
The government gives them , in a public bill , an extraordinary advantage . 
That is why the Bloc Quebecois thinks that , in the end , there is no choice but to vote against this bill . 
The oil and gas industry will see its tax rate decrease significantly , while the federal government did not tax this decrease enough . 
There is no economic incentive for such an action . 
This industrial sector is in good shape . 
In the meantime , the mining industry in Quebec is being penalized . 
It will be penalized by this same measure . 
People in the mining industry are not satisfied with the bill , because certain measures are not to their advantage . 
The federal government implies that the new tax structure will be simpler because it will rationalize the way it is observed and applied , encourage investors and make the Canadian mining sector more competitive . 
But the mining industry , which is going to have to operate under this structure , does not feel that the tax reform program is fully achieving those objectives . 
Spokespersons for this sector indicate that the provisions for gradual reduction announced in the 2003 budget are too complicated and will be hard to implement . 
In other words , the government is ramming this bill through so that the oil industry will get its money as soon as possible , while the mining industry -- this affects Quebec in particular -- is coming up empty handed . 
We are not prepared to vote in favour of such a bill . 
We need to be able to study it in more detail and try to find amendments that will satisfy this industry . 
The planned 21 % tax rate will apply to revenues from non-resource activities in 2004 , while for resource-related activities it will run until 2007 . 
This is complicated , but what is important to note is that the mining industry is not satisfied and that this plan will not provide the desired advantage . 
The Mining Association of Canada believes that the difficulties arising out of the 2003 budget and Bill C-48 demand a prompt solution , involving the federal government along with the provincial and territorial governments . 
The text I read earlier on royalties and energy said that the publication of these documents followed intense lobbying by the resources sector in favour of reducing the federal corporate income tax rate , and clearly showed that this would be profitable for the oil companies . 
However , for the mining industry , the comment to note is the one about how from a federal tax perspective there will be winners and others who are neutral over the phase-in period . 
There are complications in this bill which disadvantage the mining sector .  Corrections absolutely must be made and perhaps the bill needs to be returned to the committee to be put in proper form . 
The proposed changes to federal income tax have some serious repercussions on many mining operations in Canada . 
This translates into heavier tax burdens , federal , provincial and territorial combined , at the expense of net corporate income . 
A simple solution , proposed by the Mining Association of Canada , which benefits Canadian mineral and metal producers , would be to keep the resource allowance deduction , while dropping federal corporate tax rates from 28 % to 21 % . 
This would do away with the difference between the federal resource and non-resource income tax rates , without any need to change the provisions for revenues collected under the territorial and provincial tax systems . 
While debating this bill , we have seen the new Liberal member for Témiscamingue announce -- out of inexperience only , I hope , and nothing more -- that he is in favour of Bill C-48 , which hurts the mining sector . 
If there is one part of Quebec where mining is important and where there has been lobbying in favour of rules to accommodate the administration of this sector rather than the opposite , it is Abitibi-Témiscamingue . 
The Liberal member has already taken on the behaviour of the Liberal members here , which is to act as the representatives of Ottawa in their ridings , rather than representatives of their ridings in Ottawa . 
One of his first such actions has been to vote in favour of a bill that hurts his own riding . 
This bill also does a disservice to Quebec because of its unfair treatment of mining companies . 
As I said , it directly opposes the efforts by the Government of Quebec to revitalize that industry . 
Quebec has made efforts , and those efforts have just been cancelled out by Bill C-48 .  We have no more positive results , no advantages . 
We now see a member representing this area who is voting for such a bill . 
I invite the new Liberal member for Témiscamingue to do his homework again , to reread the bill and to go back and consult the mining industry in his area . 
When we vote on this bill at third reading , the member will have an opportunity to make amends , to change his behaviour , to really defend his constituents , here , in the House of Commons , and not simply be the federal government 's mouthpiece , and to take measures that are beneficial for his region . 
As a communiqué said , `` this will give pause to those who believe that a Liberal member in Ottawa can defend Quebec 's interests '' , and , in this case , we have shown once again that it is not possible . 
It is as though when they get elected as Liberal members here , they lose contact with their region . 
And because of the bubble of Parliament , the bubble of government , the specific interests that they may have , their strong desire to maintain a good relationship with the government , with the government members , with the ministers , they start behaving in ways that do not serve their constituents . 
This is a clearcut example . 
Bill C-48 gives effect to a legislated federal corporate taxation rate for resource income .  This rate would be reduced from 28 % to 21 % . 
This is actually where the real tax reduction lies for the gas companies , and it comes at a time when we did not need such a reduction in revenues . 
This bill also eliminates the 25 % resource allowance , while the deductions for Crown royalties and mining taxes will be allowed as expenses . 
We are therefore readjusting or recalibrating the situation . 
From what we have heard so far however , it seems that the main result has been to allow the gas companies to collect an extra $ 250 million . 
During this same period , benefits were not passed along to the consumer in the form of lower gasoline prices . 
For the year as a whole , there was no significant reduction in the price of gasoline . 
The ultimate result is that the taxpayers ' money was taken directly out of the federal government pockets . 
This creates an added pressure for the government to fulfill its obligations and we now hear the government say , for example , that it is not so sure if it will be able to meet its commitments for health care services . 
We are noticing that in various areas of federal responsibility such as military equipment , soldiers are not being provided with adequate equipment . 
In the meantime , the oil companies are getting this great gift . 
In my opinion , that is simply unacceptable . 
That is why the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against this bill . 
Allow me to quote again an excerpt from the official publication of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants , which says : 
From a federal tax perspective there will be winners .. companies with high royalty rates , such as oil and gas producers operating in Western Canada . 
However , in such provinces as Saskatchewan , Manitoba , Quebec and the Maritimes , the elimination of the resource allowance deduction for companies that benefited from the resource allowance results in an increase in the overall effective rate . 
This basically means a tax reduction for oil companies but a tax increase for mining companies . 
That is what the bottom line will be , in reality , for our economy . 
That is dangerous indeed . 
It seems to me that the government could have taken the time to develop a tidier bill , because there are many ramifications in terms of provincial taxation . 
It varies from province to province . 
A balancing act will be required . 
At present , nothing guarantees that the system will provide an adequate balance that really meets people 's expectations . 
We have before us a bill that does not deserve to be passed as it stands . 
That is why the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against it . 
It is unfair to society and the balance of our tax system . 
It is also unfair to the resource sector because the mining industry is being penalized , while the oil and gas industry is benefiting . 
This is an incomplete job , which does not meet the objectives . 
For all these reasons , the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against Bill C-48 at third reading . 
Mr. Marcel Gagnon ( Champlain , BQ ) : 
Madam Speaker , I listened carefully to my hon. colleague as well as to the member for Drummond . 
Both speeches enlightened us about the bill now before the House . 
I find it quite outrageous that the House is considering a bill that defies common sense and is completely out of step . 
The environment is a central concern for most people . 
We want to move toward cleaner energy and fight pollution in large cities like Montreal and Toronto . 
We are looking for solutions and a bill like C-48 does the exact opposite of what we should be doing . 
Not only are we not investing $ 250 million in research for clean energy , but we are spending $ 250 million on an increasingly polluting source of energy . 
Can the hon. member tell me how I should explain this to my constituents ? 
How does he explain the fact that the government is so intent on passing a bill that is so totally out of sync ? 
Is it only to score points in Western Canada ? 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
We will now proceed with statements by members . 
The hon. member for Champlain will get an answer to his question following oral question period . 
Statements by Members 
Terry Painter 
Mr. John McKay ( Scarborough East , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Terry Painter . 
Terry was known to many as the godfather of motocross on Vancouver Island . 
A motorcycle enthusiast for more than 30 years , Terry was a keen competitor and won many great titles and championships . 
Along the way he won an even greater number of friends among his fellow racers and competitors . 
In fact anyone who knew him would say that Terry took the same approach to life as he did to motorcycle racing , full throttle . 
Although friends and family will miss Terry 's easygoing sense of humour and his competitive spirit , the contribution of No. 414 to the sport of motocross will never be forgotten . 
Agriculture 
Mr. Leon Benoit ( Lakeland , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Madam Speaker , Canada 's cattle industry has been brought to its knees by the politics of BSE . 
The elk , deer , sheep and hog industries have been hit hard too , and now the feed grain industry is being dragged down . 
Simply put , the government must increase its efforts to open the borders . 
In the meantime , it must compensate farmers at least enough to keep the industry afloat until the borders are opened . 
The Canadian Alliance has focused on this problem since the single case of BSE was discovered . 
Our leader , along with our agriculture and trade teams , have met with American officials in Washington , D.C. Individual MPs have put a great deal of pressure on American congressmen and senators . 
We have felt some progress as a result . 
We have done what we can . 
Our farm groups have done what they can . 
It is crunch time now . 
Farmers need to hear from the government that the borders will open soon , and that compensation to keep the industry afloat will be forthcoming . 
It is time for the Liberal silence on this issue to end , now . 
20th Anniversary of the Organization for the Protection of Children 's Rights 
Mr. Massimo Pacetti ( Saint-Léonard -- Saint-Michel , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , 2003 marks the 20th anniversary of the Organization for the Protection of Children 's Rights , OPCR . 
Since its inception in 1983 , and with the leadership of Mr. Riccardo Di Done , founding president of this organization , whose main objective has been to protect and defend the rights of children and youth , the organization has continuously striven to improve the plight of children through advocacy , prevention , education and early intervention . 
The organization 's main goal is to ensure that children are not deprived of their most fundamental right , such as access to the material , psychological , social and spiritual environment and the support they need to grow up properly and become active and caring citizens in our communities across the globe . 
Protecting the rights of children and providing them with the food , medication , love , care , respect and sense of belonging is essential because children depend on us and deserve our attention , as it is by far the soundest and most profitable investment we can make in our future . 
Putting an end to poverty and violence against children is a tremendous challenge that we owe to our children and ourselves to make a difference . 
I want to extend my congratulations to all those who have been involved and wish the Organization for the Protection of Children 's Rights continued success for the future . 
National Co-Op Week 
Mr. Gilbert Barrette ( Témiscamingue , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , National Co-Op Week will be celebrated from October 12 to 18 . 
This is an occasion for us to reflect on the importance of cooperatives in Canada . 
The Canadian government believes that the cooperative movement has a role to play in the social and economic development of our country . 
Co-ops create employment for over 150,000 people and represent combined assets of over $ 160 billion . 
The federal government recently announced the establishment of the Co-operative Development Initiative , which is intended to promote the development of co-ops , carry out research , and test innovative ways of using the cooperative model to respond to today 's social and economic challenges . 
The Government of Canada is working with the Conseil canadien de la coopération and the Canadian Co-operative Association , which will provide advisory services to groups wishing to develop cooperatives . 
Heritage Conservation Award 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur ( Lambton -- Kent -- Middlesex , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I am pleased to inform the House that the town of Petrolia and the Petrolia Discovery , located in my riding of Lambton -- Kent -- Middlesex , has received the 2003 Heritage Conservation Award from Communities in Bloom , CIB . 
The results were announced at the national awards ceremony hosted by the city of Stratford , which honoured competing municipalities from each province and territory across the country . 
Petrolia , competing at the national level for the second straight year , also maintained its four bloom rating , the second highest CIB rating possible . 
The CIB judges described the Petrolia Discovery as `` a heritage site that depicts the early oil exploration and drilling in Petrolia , where the Canadian oil industry was born . 
The site is definitely worthy of special recognition for supporting heritage '' . 
Petrolia competed in the 3,001 to 5,000 population category against towns from Ontario , Alberta and Manitoba . 
Petrolia garnered 801 points out of a possible 1,000 points . 
In addition to maintaining its four bloom rating , Petrolia also increased its overall point score from last year , earning an invitation to compete nationally again next year . 
These awards speak for themselves . 
National Family Week 
Mr. Larry Spencer ( Regina -- Lumsden -- Lake Centre , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Madam Speaker , this is National Family Week . 
It has been called a `` celebration of families '' . 
We celebrate when families are beginning and we anticipate with excitement the great possibilities that lie ahead for a new family . 
For most of us , our family relationships are the most meaningful and precious possession we have . 
We all feel like celebrating when good things happen to us . 
We celebrate when a new family is started . 
Celebration is always called for when precious new lives are added to any family . 
We celebrate when families grow and prosper . 
There is nothing of greater value than our families .  Sometimes we may misplace our priorities for a time , but when the end comes , when life 's journey nears its end , we see in a way perhaps clearer than ever , the tremendous value of our family . 
Fame and fortune fade away and the precious love of our family begins to have a thunderous impact upon our hearts . 
I invite all Canadians everywhere to join me in celebrating the family during National Family Week . 
Women 's Soccer 
Mr. Alan Tonks ( York South -- Weston , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , making history does not happen every day but Canada 's Women 's Soccer Team did just that . 
These talented women became the first Canadian team to ever win a World Cup game . 
The team won its way past the strong teams of Argentina , Japan and China into the semi-final match held earlier this week against Sweden . 
Canada led off the scoring with a goal by Kara Lang , but Sweden came back to win with only minutes left in the game . 
Canada will be facing off against the United States on Saturday to play for the bronze metal . 
I would like to let the members of the team know , and I am sure all members of the House feel the same , how proud the country is of them and that we will all be cheering for them on Saturday . 
Go Canada Go . 
Writers 
Mr. Pierre Paquette ( Joliette , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , for the third consecutive year , the city 's writers will leave the traditional haunts of literature in order to meet with people on their own turf right in downtown Joliette , on October 18 . 
Once again , some thirty writers from Lanaudière and all over Quebec , including Chrystine Brouillet , Louis Hamelin and Guillaume Vigneault , will donate their time and more importantly their words to those wishing to write a poem , a greeting card , a love letter , or a political speech . 
Public writing stations will be set up in Joliette 's downtown shops , demonstrating the cooperative partnership between the cultural and business worlds in Joliette . 
I want to salute the man behind this project , Jean Pierre Girard , and his band of bold writers who make this unique event possible by putting their talents and knowledge at the service of others . 
There will be no writer 's block in Joliette on October 18 . 
Everyone is welcome . 
The Environment 
Mr. Julian Reed ( Halton , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on Friday I had the pleasure of attending a conference at Mount Royal College in Calgary on Canadian Energy Policy and the Challenges and Opportunities of Climate Change . 
Some might say that I was a sacrificial lamb entering the lion 's den , trying to talk to Albertans about the opportunities of implementing the Kyoto protocol . 
I would like the House to know that was not the case . 
In fact Albertans are embracing the opportunities . 
One oil company calls itself `` Beyond Petroleum '' , while another has transformed from the oil to the energy business . 
The oil industry sees opportunities in its future . 
From wind farms , to hydro power , from solar power to bio-fuels , the opportunities are popping up across this great land and Albertans are leading the way . 
Please join me in thanking Mount Royal College and all the innovators in Alberta who are moving toward the future . 
Hate Propaganda 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , one of the most odious promoters of hatred and bigotry in North America , Fred Phelps , has announced that he plans to spread his disgusting message here on Parliament Hill on October 13 . 
Mr. Phelps reserves his worst messages of hatred for homosexuals but he has a long list of those he dislikes : Catholics , Jews , anybody with whom he disagrees . 
This Mr. Phelps promotes ideas which are not welcome in Canada . 
His abuse of freedom of expression is a mockery to that right which we all treasure . 
Mr. Phelps pretends to hold his positions based on religious conviction but he makes a mockery of religious conviction . 
On behalf of all members and all Canadians , I would like to say to Mr. Phelps and his tiny minority , that their message of hatred directed at everyone and anyone who does not share their twisted convictions is not welcome here in Canada . 
Mental Health Week 
Ms. Liza Frulla ( Verdun -- Saint-Henri -- Saint-Paul -- Pointe Saint-Charles , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Mental Health Week is a time to remember that one in five Canadians suffers from mental illness . 
A study published by Statistics Canada last month confirmed this . 
According to this study , as many Canadians suffer from a mental health disorder as from other chronic conditions , such as heart disease and cancer . 
Mental illness can often lead to long term disabilities and suicide . 
This week , the Canadian Alliance on Mental Illness and Mental Health is recognizing a group of exceptional Canadians who are working to make mental health a national priority . 
I ask the House to join me in recognizing the efforts of these Canadian champions : all the members of the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs , Science and Technology ; Dr. Rémi Quirion , Scientific Director of the Institute of Neuroscience , Mental Health and Addictions ; Dr. Carolyn Bennett , hon. member for St. Paul ; John Hunkin , CEO of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ; and Rona Maynard , Editor-in-Chief of Chatelaine Magazine . 
Congratulations to all these individuals . 
Atlantic Canada 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Liberals have released yet another proposal that seeks to expand oil and gas exploration , build infrastructure and encourage training , research and development in Atlantic Canada . 
A nearly identical report released prior to the 2000 election called for the same measures that should have led to a $ 700 million investment . 
We are still waiting . 
This is yet another empty Liberal promise unveiled close to election time . 
Atlantic Canadians know that Liberals do not pay their bills . 
They have failed to pay for health care , education and defence , and as of today they failed to pay for any of the last five disasters that have befallen Nova Scotia . 
Meanwhile , the government is demanding equalization repayments from Nova Scotia to the tune of $ 160 million . 
It is just incredible . 
The insult here is that the Government of Canada asked Nova Scotia for money so that it can pay it back as disaster relief assistance . 
Nova Scotians know the difference between an -- 
The Deputy Speaker : 
The hon. member for Laurentides . 
Employment Insurance 
Ms. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , insistent and repeated interventions by the Bloc Quebecois have finally made the Liberal government realize that employment insurance , in its current form , does not meet the needs of outlying regions , where seasonal work is an economic reality for those men and women who experience it daily . 
By agreeing to extend the transitional measures until October 9 , 2004 , to lessen the effects on the unemployed in the Madawaska-Charlotte region of New Brunswick , and the Lower St. Lawrence and North Shore regions of Quebec , the Liberal government is merely confirming the mess it has made of the employment insurance program . 
The announcement is a step in the right direction , but it does not go nearly far enough . 
The government needs to understand that it must do more than provide transitional measures and agree to an indepth review of employment insurance . 
The government must promise to never again spend the money of the unemployed by raiding the employment insurance fund . 
Official Languages 
Ms. Yolande Thibeault ( Saint-Lambert , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to commend the excellent work by the Standing Committee on Official Languages in producing a report called `` Immigration as a Tool for the Development of Official Language Minority Communities '' . 
The government agrees with many of the committee 's recommendations , and has already acted on some of them through the Action Plan on Official Languages announced in March . 
Linguistic duality is a cornerstone of Canadian society , and the federal government considers the vitality of the official language minority communities to be of major importance . 
I am therefore pleased to report that many of the standing committee 's remaining recommendations will be addressed in the strategic framework to be released later this fall by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration 's Francophone Minority Communities Steering Committee . 
Together with our federal , provincial , territorial and municipal partners -- 
The Deputy Speaker : 
The hon. member for Winnipeg -- Transcona . 
Izzy Asper 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg -- Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , many are gathered in Winnipeg today to mourn the passing and celebrate the life of a great Canadian and Manitoban , Israel Asper . 
My first impression of Izzy Asper dates back to my student days at the University of Winnipeg when I heard him speak as the engaging and frank leader of the Manitoba Liberals . 
I saw him last this summer when I attended the announcement of a new Canadian human rights museum to be built at the Forks in Winnipeg , something that will surely be the crowning achievement of a life already exceptional for its philanthropy . 
Most of all , as a fellow citizen of Winnipeg , I want to praise the way that Izzy Asper tried and succeeded in making Winnipeg the centre of an economic success story that others might have taken elsewhere . 
I may be a critic of corporate concentration in the media but it was nice to have it concentrated in Winnipeg for a change . 
Izzy Asper 's loyalty and generosity to Winnipeg will be an enduring legacy . 
Although we did not share his politics , my fellow NDP MPs from Manitoba and I salute a remarkable Canadian and extend our sincere condolences to his family . 
World Sight Day 
Mr. Larry Bagnell ( Yukon , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to congratulate all those who supported World Sight Day today on the steps of Parliament Hill . 
Every five seconds someone in the world goes blind . 
Every minute , a child in the world goes blind . 
In the next 17 years 28 million people will go blind and of those people , 80 % are preventable with good water , with vitamin A and cataract surgery . 
As we degenerate in the next hour into political manoeuvring , please just reflect for a moment on what we might achieve if we were to put all that energy into curing and preventing the blindness of those 28 million people . 
Canadian Wheat Board 
Mr. David Anderson ( Cypress Hills -- Grasslands , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as if farmers in Canada have not suffered enough loss and devastation as a direct result of government apathy .  Now grain producers in western Canada will not likely receive a final payment for wheat and barley sold by the Canadian Wheat Board in 2002-03 because the board pulled out of a lucrative world market and then sold into a depressed world market . 
The Wheat Board 's lack of competitive drive has resulted in sales so low that the federal government will be required to subsidize its initial payments out of the public purse . 
What we do not know is how much that subsidy will be . 
The minister will not tell us and the board 's marketing information is locked up tighter than Fort Knox . 
It has to be asked . 
What are they hiding ? 
Was it not just last week that the Auditor General severely chastised the government for its lack of transparency ? 
It is a simple question that I ask . 
What is the Wheat Board 's deficit and how much will it cost taxpayers ? 
Climate Change 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences has awarded funds for further research on climate change in the Arctic . 
One of the grants is going to Peter Lafleur of Trent University and colleagues who will be studying carbon exchange in the Daring Lake region of the Northwest Territories . 
The research is an important piece in the puzzle of climate change which is addressed by the Kyoto protocol . 
The fundamental question to be addressed is whether the Arctic is a net source or a net sink for carbon . 
The more Canadians understand carbon exchange , the better we will be able to comply with Kyoto . 
I congratulate Professor Lafleur , his colleagues and students and congratulate the foundation for its fine work . 
I also congratulate the federal government for its wisdom in setting up such a foundation to address climate change . 
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
Veterans Affairs 
Mrs. Carol Skelton ( Saskatoon -- Rosetown -- Biggar , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as of this morning an all party committee is asking the government to reinstate the VIP benefits to all 23,000 war widows .  The government has heard from these widows . 
The government has heard from the public .  The government has now heard from a committee of the House . 
When will the minister reverse his position and extend the VIP benefits to all war widows ? 
Mr. Ivan Grose ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it was not a case of taking the VIP benefit away from anyone . 
Actually we added 10,000 to the rolls .  Within our budget that was within our capability at the time . 
I would suggest that the hon. member opposite wait a while . 
She may see a change . 
Mrs. Carol Skelton ( Saskatoon -- Rosetown -- Biggar , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government can afford to forgive millions of dollars in technology partnership loans . 
It can afford to reward its Liberal friends with millions in advertising contracts . 
It can afford millions of dollars in corporate welfare . 
Can the minister explain why his government cannot afford to support Canada 's war widows ? 
Mr. Ivan Grose ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in reply to the hon. member , the Department of Veterans Affairs operates within a budget . 
We reapportioned our moneys and managed to look after 10,000 widows who would not have been looked after otherwise , but that is within our budget . 
We will have to wait and see what happens in the future with another budget . 
Mrs. Carol Skelton ( Saskatoon -- Rosetown -- Biggar , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government has millions of dollars for corporate welfare and nothing for widows . 
It has millions of dollars for the next Liberal leader 's private companies and nothing for widows . 
Why does the government have millions for millionaires and pennies for pensioners ? 
Mr. Ivan Grose ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I challenge the statement that there is nothing for widows . 
Ten thousand additional widows are going to be looked after through the rearrangement of funds within the department . 
Member for LaSalle -- Émard 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a big mystery . 
Lansdowne Technologies was part of the new Liberal leader 's blind management agreement in 1994 and 1995 but by 1996 , poof , it was gone off the list of declarable assets . 
Can the government explain how one of the new Liberal leader 's companies did $ 12 million in business with the government without being included in his declaration of assets ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first of all , the fact that this matter was brought to the House 's attention has led the hon. member for LaSalle -- Émard himself to ask the ethics counsellor why this particular company was not listed . 
In any event , as Mr. Wilson himself said to the press yesterday , the fact that the parent company was listed meant that the blind trust arrangements extended to all of the subsidiary companies , including Lansdowne . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that does not answer the question of why it was on there in 1994 and 1995 but not in 1996 . 
Let us remember that it was the new Liberal leader who had the responsibility for checking and confirming the truthfulness of that declaration of assets . 
It was his responsibility . 
What penalties will the new Liberal leader face for signing a false declaration of assets ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first of all the member for LaSalle -- Émard did not sign a false declaration of assets . 
Second , the member himself was interested enough in this issue to contact the ethics counsellor , something the hon. member for Medicine Hat did not do , and why is that ? 
It is because all he is interested in doing is not getting the facts or getting the truth but throwing dirt . 
What we have is a member who since he entered Parliament much less became a minister has followed not only the letter but the spirit of the ethical rules . 
In fact he went beyond what the rules called for and the member for Medicine Hat stands up and -- 
The Deputy Speaker : 
The hon. member for Laurier -- Sainte-Marie . 
CINAR 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier -- Sainte-Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the CINAR affair , the government keeps saying that it never comments on RCMP investigations or their findings . 
Yet in the scandals concerning Airbus , Placeteco , Confections Saint-Élie and Groupe Polygone , all the ministers responsible did not hesitate to announce that the investigations were over . 
They were able to talk about those ones . 
Given all these precedents , why , in the case of CINAR , is the government refusing to say whether the RCMP has submitted its report ? 
The RCMP recommendations , the refusal to act -- 
The Deputy Speaker : 
The hon. Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons . 
Hon. Don Boudria ( Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if I am not mistaken , the hon. member and his colleagues have asked me this several times over the course of three or four days . 
I am always glad to answer the same question . 
The first day , a member of the opposition asked if there was an investigation . 
I said I would look into it . 
Once I looked at Hansard a little more carefully , I realized the question alleged that there was an RCMP investigation . 
The next day in the House I said that , this being related to an investigation or lack of investigation by the RCMP , we would not comment . 
That is still the case . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier -- Sainte-Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what the government House leader is saying is quite simply not true . 
What he said was the opposite . 
When we asked about Modes Conili , we were told the RCMP was investigating . 
In connection with the HRDC scandal , we were referred to the RCMP . 
Groupaction : the RCMP . 
Lafleur Communications : the RCMP . 
Everest : the RCMP . 
When they do not want to talk to us , they refer us to the RCMP . 
Even with CINAR they told us , `` It is under RCMP investigation '' . 
Really now . 
What we are asking them today is this : why refuse to show the report ? 
What do you have to hide ?  Who is behind CINAR ? 
Hon. Don Boudria ( Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have never met anyone who works for that company . 
I do not know what the hon. member is referring to . 
This is ridiculous . 
I would simply say this to the hon. member : yes , there may have been times when cases have been referred to agencies . 
That is not the same thing as whether or not there is an investigation . 
I will not comment as to whether there has been a report or whether there has not , just as I will not comment on the contents of the report . 
I have already said so . 
Of course , sometimes mention is made here in this House of cases that have been referred , but not to whether an investigation has been carried out . 
This is not the same thing . 
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg -- Jacques-Cartier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there is something very peculiar about the CINAR affair . 
The government is acting out of character . 
It went so far as to refuse to confirm whether or not it had received an investigation report . 
Is is not behaving this way because someone in this government has something to hide in connection with the CINAR affair ? 
Is that not the real reason ? 
Hon. Don Boudria ( Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , to the same question , I give the same answer . 
A few days or perhaps a week ago , the hon. member or a colleague of his enquired about this report . 
As I have said , I will not comment on whether or not there is a report , nor will I comment on whether or not there is an investigation that would be the subject of the report on which I am not commenting . 
So , we are going in circles . 
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg -- Jacques-Cartier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government should always be transparent on this kind of issue . 
It gladly shares information when it suits its purposes , as demonstrated by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois , but withholds information when it does not . 
Really , is it acceptable behaviour for a government to be controlling information to serve its own interests ? 
Is that acceptable ? 
Hon. Don Boudria ( Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is just another way of putting the same question and getting the same answer . 
We are being asked -- 
An hon. member : Keep on lying , lying , lying . 
Hon. Don Boudria : 
Accusations are being thrown at us and all sorts of unparliamentary language is being used right now . 
That is probably an excuse for getting expelled from the House and making a scene . 
In any case , I will not comment on whether or not there is such a report , whether or not there has been an investigation , because I do not know . 
And that is how it should be . 
Police work should be left to the police . 
Equalization Payments 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou -- Antigonish -- Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Liberals are asking storm-struck Nova Scotians to dig deep and repay the federal government $ 160 million because of a mistake made here in Ottawa . 
In the past , such payments were forgiven . 
What does it say to Canadians when a multimillionaire shipping magnate/finance minister can avoid paying his fair share of taxes while simultaneously slashing billions to transfer payments intended for the provinces ? 
If equalization and fairness are the issue , will the minister crack down on those currently exploiting Canadian taxes and come to the aid of beleaguered provinces in need of assistance at times like this ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that was such a convoluted mix , a spaghetti bowl of false statements , one tied to the other . 
But I guess after being chased by an excited suitor as he was , he may have been inclined to misspeak himself . 
There has been no change . 
There was no mistake . 
Calculation of equalization payments is based on a formula . 
Everybody understands that . 
The numbers are plugged in as soon as the numbers are available . 
They have been plugged in and the calculations are made .  All the provinces understand that and they prefer that kind of system to one that would be -- 
The Deputy Speaker : 
The hon. member for Pictou -- Antigonish -- Guysborough . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou -- Antigonish -- Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Finance said that when payments were not paid back the last time , he was in high school . 
He behaves as if he is still in high school . 
Ottawa has not paid Nova Scotia 's outstanding disaster claims going back to 1999 . 
After the 1998 ice storm , Ottawa paid over $ 250 million to Quebec and $ 55 million to Ontario . 
Within one year in Manitoba , Ottawa paid out over $ 136 million in claims . 
Farmers , fishermen and foresters were particularly hard hit by hurricane Juan . 
When will the Prime Minister cancel the clawback and pay the money to Nova Scotia for disaster relief ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member is so jumbled up here that he is combining transfer payments and equalization , and now disaster relief . 
Let us get a few things straight . 
First , transfer payments were increased by $ 35 billion in the health accord . 
Second , equalization is a formula . 
It is based on numbers which are derived by Statistics Canada . 
There is nothing mysterious about that , although it is complicated , I grant that to him , and I will try to explain it to him at another time . 
Third , disaster relief is based upon expenses that are actually incurred . 
Nova Scotia will receive federal disaster -- 
The Deputy Speaker : 
The hon. member for Winnipeg -- Transcona . 
Government Contracts 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg -- Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Industry . 
We have heard a troubling rumour that Statistics Canada has awarded a multi-million dollar contract to an American corporation to do the dress rehearsal for the census in 2005 and subsequently the census itself . 
That corporation , we have heard , is Lockheed Martin , one of the biggest munitions companies in the world . 
I wonder if the minister could tell us whether or not this is in fact true and , if it is true , why the Liberal government has decided to award such a contract . 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , one thing I can assure the House is that Statistics Canada will continue to do its job according to the worldclass standards that it has always achieved . 
We will make certain of that . 
It has a well deserved reputation for excellence and it will continue to work to deserve that reputation . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg -- Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let the House take note that the Minister of Industry did not answer my question and did not deny that such a contract has been offered . 
Given that this is an American munitions corporation that is actually all wound up with the star wars thing , I wonder if the minister could explain to us the connection between star wars and Statistics Canada and tell us whether or not the government is involved in the letting of a contract of this kind to an American corporation . 
Would he answer the question ? 
Surely he knows what is going on in his own department . 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is working himself into an agitated state when he should focus instead on the real purpose of all this , which is to make sure we get statistics numbers and a census that we can rely upon . 
Statistics Canada will continue to do what is necessary to achieve just that . 
Member for LaSalle -- Émard 
Mr. James Rajotte ( Edmonton Southwest , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the finance minister 's argument with respect to Lansdowne Technologies simply does not make sense . 
CSE Marine Services , a sister company to Lansdowne , is included in the declaration of the new Liberal leader 's assets . 
Lansdowne , in the same situation , is not . 
Clearly there is a problem with his public declaration . 
My question again to the finance minister is , why was it included in 1994 and 1995 and excluded in 1996 and afterward ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not making an argument . 
I am simply quoting what the ethics counsellor said , which was that because the parent company was listed the blind trust rules would still have applied . 
What we are getting at here is the essence of this . 
Is there a conflict ? 
The ethics counsellor says that it is covered by the blind trust rules . 
The opposition is not interested in whether or not there was a conflict . 
All it is interested in is trying to hurt somebody 's reputation . 
It is unworthy . 
Mr. James Rajotte ( Edmonton Southwest , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the fact is that Lansdowne Technologies is a subsidiary of Canada Steamship Lines and Lansdowne can call on CSL for support in its contracting with the federal government . 
Lansdowne 's clients read as a who 's who of the federal government : Transport Canada , National Defence , Foreign Affairs , Health Canada , Consulting and Audit Canada and many more departments . 
Is it not true that the new Liberal leader will have to rise from the cabinet table with regard to every matter regarding space , health , the RCMP and national defence because they all have contracts with Lansdowne Technologies ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I repeat that this is a matter which is dealt with by the ethics counsellor . 
It is within his purview . 
As I said earlier , since the member for LaSalle -- Émard came to the House he has made every effort to ensure , not just that he comply with the applicable rules but went beyond what the rules required . 
These matters will be ones that will be dealt with in the appropriate way by Mr. Wilson . 
Business Development Bank of Canada 
Mr. Paul Crête ( Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Industry confirmed yesterday that the Business Development Bank of Canada is an independent entity and that he could not intervene . 
Nevertheless , the regulations governing the bank require a complete audit by the Auditor General every five years ; the last one was four years ago . 
Would it be possible for the minister to ask the Auditor General to act one year earlier , considering the abuses that have been discovered in the BDC ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Auditor General does not need orders from the Government of Canada to do her work . 
As for the corporation , it is a crown corporation , independent of the government . 
Its president has appeared several times before the Standing Committee on Industry , Science and Technology , of which my hon. colleague is a member . 
If he has questions , he can ask them of the president . 
Mr. Paul Crête ( Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister should stop insisting that he cannot do anything to protect the citizens ' money . 
Will he admit that he could act if he wanted to , and that if he refuses to do so , it is because he does not want us to find out more about the internal administration of the bank , whose president the government has changed whenever it sw fit to do so ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Standing Committee on Industry , Science and Technology , of which my hon. friend is a member , has recently completed an indepth study of the BDC 's performance , according to its mandate . 
The hon. member is entitled to ask questions on this subject . 
While the president appears before the committee , the Auditor General does have the power to examine all accounts . 
It is an independent crown corporation , but it is accountable in that respect . 
Government Loans 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , three years ago the industry minister gave 80 million tax dollars to buy out BioChem Pharma , a company in Quebec . 
Since then , BioChem was bought out by a British multinational that is now shutting down its Quebec plant and laying off hundreds of workers . 
However , according to documents that we have obtained , no payments have been made on Industry Canada 's loan to BioChem ; not one red cent . 
How can the minister justify giving $ 80 million in corporate welfare to a company that is now laying off hundreds of skilled workers ? 
Is this the minister 's idea of a successful investment ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we reject the philosophy of the Alliance Party that says the Government of Canada should not be investing in innovation in this country . 
We believe we should be investing in innovation . 
With respect to BioChem Pharma , we are watching very closely the developments with that company . 
We expect the purchaser of that company to honour its obligations to the people of Canada , including the terms of repayment of that investment . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the plot thickens because it turns out that BioChem and the company that then bought it gave $ 120,000 to the Liberal Party of Canada in 2000 and 2001 , making it the fourth largest donor in the country . 
I am sure it is a mere coincidence that those donations were made at the same time that BioChem received its $ 80 million loan and that the government negotiated its multi-billion dollar sale to a foreign multinational . 
Now Canadian labs are being closed , scientists are being laid off and Canadian taxpayers are left holding an $ 80 million bag . 
Is that the minister 's idea of a -- 
The Deputy Speaker : 
The hon. Minister of Industry . 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the TPC investment in that company was made after due diligence by professional officials who decided it was a good investment for innovation in this country . 
Let me assure the member that we will take all steps necessary , divestment or not , to ensure that our position is protected in relation to the repayment of that investment . 
Foreign Affairs 
Mr. Stéphane Bergeron ( Verchères -- Les-Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is becoming increasingly difficult to learn with any certainty the RCMP 's true role in Maher Arar 's deportation to Syria by the U.S. authorities . 
We know that the RCMP Public Complaints Commission is currently evaluating various scenarios so it can get to the bottom of this affair . 
Since RCMP obstruction of the commission 's work is not beyond the realm of possibility , does the Solicitor General intend to change his mind and order a public inquiry , which we feel is the only way to shed light on this whole affair , which is getting cloudier by the minute ? 
Hon. Wayne Easter ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have answered this question so many times in the House that I think the member could almost memorize the answer . 
The facts are the facts and I have stated them . 
The facts are that the RCMP did not disclose to the American authorities on this issue . 
It was not part of the decision . 
It is that simple . 
Those are the facts . 
Mr. Stéphane Bergeron ( Verchères -- Les-Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the more the Solicitor General says , the less we understand . 
It is becoming increasingly cloudy . 
Since it is becoming increasingly clear that the Solicitor General is trying to cover up the RCMP 's actions , what will it take for the government to show transparency and order a public inquiry , as Amnesty International has suggested , this very day ? 
Hon. Wayne Easter ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me be very clear . 
I have tried to be very transparent on this issue . 
I went before the foreign affairs committee . 
I answered questions this morning at the justice committee on this issue . 
The answer remains the same as I have stated in this House several times . 
The member knows what that answer is . 
Those are the facts . 
The RCMP was not involved in the decision to arrest and deport Mr. Arar . 
That is how simple it is . 
Government Loans 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley -- Abbotsford , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , here comes another due diligence problem . 
Yesterday the Minister of Industry admitted that last year he received only $ 19 million in Technology Partnerships Canada repayments . 
That is a mere fraction of the billion-plus dollars that have been doled out . 
Corporate welfare is alive and well in Canada , is it not ? 
What is the minister doing to accelerate the TPC repayments , or is it true that he does not really expect any of these repayments to occur anyway ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , they are all repayable . 
These investments are often made in emerging sectors of the economy . 
However time is required to bring products to market to produce revenue so they can be repaid . 
Some of these in the biotechnology field need a 10 or 12 year period of investment before there is a return . 
We are investing in pre-competitive research that will enable companies in the future to put products and services on the market to create economic growth and jobs . 
That is what this is all about . 
However all of these are repayable . 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley -- Abbotsford , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , he forgot to mention the investment in the Liberal Party of Canada . 
Let us review the situation . 
Western Star Trucks will likely not repay a thing . 
Shire and BioChem Pharma will likely not repay a thing . 
Bombardier , no repayments and Pratt &amp ; Whitney , no repayments . 
Less than 2 % of the billions of dollars given away through TPC have been repaid . 
Will the minister table a schedule of repayments owed to TPC and be a little more responsible for a change ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what I will do is tell the member that in every case the repayment schedule is calculated to reflect the nature of the investment . 
In other words , if the money is being used to develop a new jet engine or to develop new biotechnology , then the repayment occurs after that has been developed , produced and is on the market so there is revenue to provide the repayment . 
However some of these repayment schedules do take time because there is a lag period before the research is completed and the product is on the market . 
However they are all repayable and repayment schedules are negotiated in relation to the nature of the product . 
Employment Insurance 
Mr. Gérard Binet ( Frontenac -- Mégantic , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the current EI economic regions came into effect on July 9 , 2000 . 
These regions reflected changes in the labour market and ensured that people living in areas with high unemployment received the assistance they need from the EI program . 
HRDC also recognized at that time that the impact of the changes was greater than expected in the regions and introduced transitional measures . 
Recently , we have heard that workers in these regions will require additional time to adjust . 
Can the Minister of Human Resources Development tell the House what the government is doing to help workers in the affected regions in Quebec and New Brunswick ? 
Hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to announce that we have extended the transitional period for employment insurance in the economic regions by one year .  This is the case in the Madawaska-Charlotte region of New Brunswick and the Lower St. Lawrence and North Shore regions of Quebec . 
We understand that seasonal work forms an important part of the social and economic fabric of Canada , which is why I am pleased that the Prime Minister will be establishing a task force on seasonal work that will examine the range of issues that affect the industries , the workforce and the communities that are dependent on these activities . 
Foreign Affairs 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland -- Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I just received a letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs that says that Maher Arar was only in Jordan while he was `` in transit '' on his way to Syria . 
The Syrians confirmed yesterday that he was not in transit but he was incarcerated and being interrogated while he was in Jordan . 
Why would the Minister of Foreign Affairs tell me that this Canadian was in transit when he was really in jail and being questioned ? 
Hon. Bill Graham ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Mr. Arar was deported by the American authorities from New York to Syria . 
He passed through Jordan ; he was in transit in Jordan . 
He was taken to Syria through Jordan . 
The letter is absolutely accurate . 
The hon. member knows that . 
That is exactly what we said and that is the truth . 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland -- Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , being interrogated and in jail is not in transit . 
The Syrians confirmed yesterday that Mr. Arar was in jail and not in transit at all . 
Now that we know Mr. Arar was in Jordan , where was he in Jordan ? 
Who had him in custody while he was in Jordan ? 
Did the minister ever ask any of these questions ? 
Hon. Bill Graham ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , of course , we asked those questions . 
However , Mr. Arar has returned to Canada . 
I think it is important to allow Mr. Arar to have an opportunity to tell his story as to what happened to him . 
We are respectful of that and we will allow that to happen . 
We will respect the case of Mr. Arar as we respect the cases of all citizens . 
We will not prejudge what they will say about their rights , which we intend to support in defending them . 
Government Contracts 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg -- Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is again to the Minister of Industry . 
I will allow for the fact that perhaps his first answer to my question might have been based on not knowing what the situation was . 
Some time has passed . 
Could the minister tell us whether or not such a contract has been awarded to Lockheed-Martin for the census . 
If it has , could he tell us in which wing of the Pentagon all this information on Canadians will be stored ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as with any other such crown agency , contracts awarded by Statistics Canada are awarded after a full bidding process where value for money and the contract price is evaluated . 
I have every confidence Statistics Canada used that process in its entirety in this and every other case . 
Foreign Affairs 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Regina -- Qu'Appelle , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is to the Solicitor General . 
Today the Solicitor General reaffirmed that there was no contact between Canadian and American officials prior to the deportation of Mahar Arar to Syria . 
However , today in the Toronto Star there is a quote from an American official which says that Canadian security informed them that Arar was under surveillance by Canada because he had travelled to Afghanistan . 
How can the minister continue to deny that there was an exchange of information between his government and the Americans that may have led to the deportation of Arar to Syria ? 
If he continues to deny that , why does he not just resign ? 
Hon. Wayne Easter ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have tried to make it clear all along that I cannot confirm or deny any investigation of any individual or any matter involving the RCMP . 
That would be irresponsible of me , including in terms of any exchange of information . 
To do so would violate the privileges of individuals and could impinge the integrity of investigations . 
Government Contracts 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the junior defence minister used a private jet owned by the Irving Group of Companies on a political trip to Washington . 
He is governed by conflict guidelines preventing him from receiving benefits greater than $ 200 . 
An executive jet just idling to the end of the runway costs more than $ 200 . 
Why did this individual take this trip and not disclose it to the proper public authorities ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I presume the hon. member is referring to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence . 
He should know that the member in question cleared his relationship , which is a longstanding one between his family and the Irving family , in advance of taking on his duties as parliamentary secretary . 
The ethics counsellor has blessed that relationship , and understands the nature of the business that occurred between those families . 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the conflict to anybody else is pretty obvious . 
The Irving Group has defence interests through Fleetway Inc . 
Its website states that it is well positioned to respond to the needs of government involving engineering support contracts , including national defence . 
Who over there will stand up to justify this junior defence minister taking an airplane trip from a company that has defence contracts , and good luck to them ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the very fact that the hon. member claims that this is a junior defence minister shows that the whole foundation for his question is false . 
If he had any interest in telling the truth he would not be saying such things . 
What the ethics counsellor proved was a longstanding personal relationship , as is anticipated in the code of conduct . 
Does the member know what is in the code of conduct ? 
I suspect not . 
Immigration 
Mr. Serge Cardin ( Sherbrooke , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Borja family has spent the last 100 days in a church in North Hatley , in the Eastern Townships , under threat of expulsion . 
This family is desperate for a fair and equitable review of its case . 
This sad case due to the lack of any appeal tribunal for refugees . 
What is the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration waiting for before he complies with the act and sets up an appeal tribunal for refugees ? 
Hon. Denis Coderre ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not negotiate in churches or with churches . 
Mr. Serge Cardin ( Sherbrooke , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when invited to intervene , he did in fact say , `` I am not going to start negotiating in churches '' . 
Does the minister not realize that , for these refugees , sanctuary in a church is their final recourse because of his inability to create an appeal tribunal ? 
Hon. Denis Coderre ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , instead of engaging in petty politics , the hon. member ought to understand that we on this side of the floor do not condone civil disobedience . 
Agriculture 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk -- Interlake , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the current price for live beef cattle is below the cost of production . 
This problem can be corrected by getting the U.S. border opened up right away . 
The agriculture minister has been working on this issue since May 20 , so surely by now he must have been able to negotiate a date to open the border . 
Would the minister tell us on what date we will be able to export live cattle ? 
Mr. Claude Duplain ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , opening up the border is based on science and we are in the process of proving that it can and must be opened . 
Negotiations with the United States continue daily . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk -- Interlake , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , ministers come into the House and admit failure when tens of thousands of our farm families are running into financial problems on the basis of almost losing their farms . 
I would like to ask the minister , has he been briefed by the agriculture minister as to the rules that will be coming into place in order for us to export live cattle , and what are those rules ? 
Mr. Claude Duplain ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , these rules are being negotiated with the United States . 
The border is not open yet , but we are working very hard ; the minister knows full well that the problem will be resolved when the border is fully open . 
In the meantime , we are taking various measures to help the farmers , such as the policy framework that they can take advantage of to sign agreements and get a little money . 
Mr. Gilbert Barrette ( Témiscamingue , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , from what I understand , Quebec is signing its Agriculture Policy Framework implementation agreement today . 
Will the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food tell us what this means for Quebec 's farmers ? 
Mr. Claude Duplain ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his question . 
This is good news for farmers in his riding and the entire province of Quebec . 
Today the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food is in Trois-Rivières to sign the APF implementation agreement with Quebec . 
I think we need to thank and congratulate Quebec . 
This is very good news . 
Some hon. members : Bravo . 
Mr. Claude Duplain : Quebec will receive nearly $ 88 million from the federal government over the next five years for the four components of the framework . 
Quebec and Canada will commit to paying $ 304 million over three years to ease the transition . 
Moreover , with the Agricultural Policy Framework and its risk management program , farmers will be able to receive money immediately . 
Energy 
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of the Environment told the House that he did everything he could to stop the Sumas II project , but Tuesday the environment committee learned from the International Joint Commission co-chair , Herb Gray , that his group would have investigated Sumas if it had been asked . 
The government did not even bother to ask it . 
Fraser Valley residents , the B.C. government and many citizens of Washington state all oppose Sumas . 
Why did the minister not do everything to help stop this plan ? 
Mr. Alan Tonks ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is not quite what the co-chair of the International Joint Commission told the committee . 
He indicated to the committee that the International Joint Commission was involved in a complete review of the treaty in terms of its applications on those issues that , in fact , up to this point have been beyond its jurisdiction . 
I must question the premise upon which the member has asked the question . 
The minister could not have been asked that question by the IJC because it was not within its jurisdiction . 
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is totally just a bunch of gobbledegook . 
There is absolutely no way . 
The co-chair said `` All you have to do is ask me and we would investigate '' . 
Doing everything in the minister 's power to stop the Sumas from polluting the Fraser Valley means that we ask the IJC to investigate .  The environment minister failed to do that . 
The International Joint Commission would have investigated . 
All it had to do was be asked by the government . 
The minister knew who to call . 
It was his good friend Mr. Gray . 
Why did he not do that ? 
Mr. Alan Tonks ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I can only assume that the member has innocently , rather than deliberately , characterized what was actually said in committee . 
What was actually said in committee , and the member will recall , was that the Fraser River , as it comes within the jurisdiction of the IJC , does not call for an input from the IJC . 
That was the answer that was given to the member . 
I am surprised that he would try to -- 
The Deputy Speaker : 
The hon. member for Laval Centre . 
Immigration 
Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral ( Laval Centre , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if refugees are hiding in churches , it is because the minister will not implement the Refugee Appeal Division provided for by the Immigration Act . 
In a letter dated September 24 addressed to me , the minister conceded that the appeal division would provide asylum seekers whose claims are dismissed with a right to appeal . 
When will the minister do justice to refugee status claimants ? 
When will he comply with his own legislation by implementing the Refugee Appeal Division ? 
Hon. Denis Coderre ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think a distinction must be made between those who engage in civil disobedience and those who come under the purview of the appeal board . 
I agree with the hon. member . 
I said that we will eventually have such a process . 
In light of the current structural situation , I have asked cabinet to examine various options . 
We want to implement such a process , but I do not think that we should mix these issues of refuge and appeal . 
Fisheries 
Hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
In British Columbia 's Broughton Archipelago the wild salmon stocks have declined by 70 % to 90 % because of the harmful impacts of sea lice outbreaks from fish farms . 
The federal sea lice action plan has managed to reduce the lice infecting wild salmon .  Wild salmon stocks have begun to replenish . 
Is the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans willing to extend the sea lice action plan to next year to ensure the restoration of wild salmon stocks ? 
Hon. Robert Thibault ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wish thank the member for his question . 
The sampling phase of DFO 's $ 1.3 million wild salmon action plan is complete and is entering the data analysis phase . 
DFO has been regularly reporting its progress to the public on the department 's website . 
I wish to remind my colleagues that it is premature to draw any conclusions from the data until it can be properly analyzed . 
Scientists will publish a detailed report of their findings at the earliest possible opportunity . 
I am confident that the results of this initiative will enhance the public 's understanding of this issue and will contribute to the decisions affecting wild Pacific salmon . 
Veterans Affairs 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint-Jean , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last May , the Minister of Veterans Affairs announced a series of legislative and regulatory measures concerning the veterans independence program , among other things . 
Regulations passed quietly on June 18 exclude 23,000 widows from this program . 
At last week 's Liberal caucus meeting , the Prime Minister reportedly promised to go to bat for these widows overlooked in the June 18 regulations . 
Could the Prime Minister tell us today how he intends to correct this unacceptable injustice to women ? 
Mr. Ivan Grose ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the subject to which the member refers is one that we have gone over and over in the House . 
Rather than exclude 23,000 widows , we added 10,000 within the budget at that time . 
I would remind the member that the department looks after $ 1.6 billion a year in pensions and allowances to veterans . 
I know the member is not from the same generation that I am from , but I remember when a dollar was a lot of money , and $ 1.6 billion is a heck of -- 
The Deputy Speaker : The hon. member for Brandon -- Souris . 
Agriculture 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon -- Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today I received a self-serving communications package from the Minister of Agriculture telling us how wonderfully he has been handling the BSE file , but hello ? 
The border is still closed to live cattle . 
It is not open . 
The agriculture committee was making arrangements to go to Washington . 
Unfortunately , the minister decided to cancel that trip . 
He made the chairman cancel the trip to Washington . 
I want to ask the minister , why is that ? 
Is he threatened or is it the fact that he just does not like a proactive initiative ? 
Mr. Claude Duplain ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the committee cannot go ; however , I will ask the hon. member to check whether the Canadian Cattlemen 's Association could have requested that the committee not travel to the United States . 
Coast Guard 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville -- Musquodoboit Valley -- Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last week at our fisheries committee the commissioner of the Coast Guard indicated to our committee that it is not the mandate of the Coast Guard to guard the coast . 
My question quite simply to the government is this : Who is guarding our three oceans and our Great Lakes waters at this time ? 
Hon. Robert Thibault ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Coast Guard performs an admirable job in making sure that we have maritime safety , that we have pollution control , that we have aids to navigation , and that we serve as a platform to all federal agencies when they are in need . 
The Departments of Transport , National Defence and all the agencies combined contribute all the services required . 
Health 
Mr. Rob Merrifield ( Yellowhead , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the World Health Organization is preparing for another SARS outbreak this winter . 
The Naylor report said that Canada is not adequately prepared for a true pandemic . 
With the fall flu season upon us , the Naylor report urged Health Canada to issue national recommendations for SARS surveillance by next week . 
Will these guidelines be in place and why have they not been here by now ? 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Health , Lib. ) : 
In fact , Mr. Speaker , I am fully aware of the recommendations made by Dr. Naylor . 
We know that influenza season will be soon upon us . 
We also know that there may be some confusion in the minds of Canadians around whether that which they are suffering from is influenza , or perhaps they might be concerned about SARS . 
That is why we are working with chief public health officers and medical officers across the country to ensure that we have the systems in place , the surveillance systems and the data information and collection which will in fact ensure that we are protecting the health and safety of Canadians . 
Business of the House 
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , could the government House leader inform us as to what the business would be for the rest of the day , for tomorrow and for the week following ? 
Hon. Don Boudria ( Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to answer that question .  I think it is an excellent question . 
This afternoon we will continue with the debate on Bill C-48 , the resource taxation measures . 
We will then turn to a motion to refer Bill C-38 , the cannabis legislation , to committee before second reading . 
If this is complete , then we would follow with : Bill C-32 , the Criminal Code amendments ; Bill C-19 , the first nations fiscal institution bill ; and Bill C-36 , the archives bill , if we get to that . 
There is some discussion going on about Bill C-36 . 
Tomorrow we will begin with Bill C-19 , if it has not already been completed , and then go to Bill C-13 . 
If we have not completed the list for today , we could as well continue with that . 
Next week is the Thanksgiving week of constituency work . 
When we return on October 20 , it is my intention to call Bill C-49 to begin ; that is the redistribution legislation , for the benefit of hon. members . 
When that is concluded , we would return to any of the business not completed this week or reported from committee . 
Thursday , October 23 , shall be an allotted day . 
That is the sixth day in the supply cycle . 
Government Orders 
The Income Tax Act 
The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-48 , An Act to amend the Income Tax Act ( natural resources ) be read the third time and passed . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
I think a question from the member for Champlain was being answered . 
There are about eight minutes left in the question and comment period . 
The hon. member for Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques . 
Mr. Paul Crête ( Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , before answering , I will go over the question of the member for Champlain . 
Indeed , the debate is on a bill that would provide very large tax reductions to oil companies ; these are huge amounts for an industry that is doing quite well financially . 
I will remind the House of the magnitude of the profits . 
In its second quarterly report to shareholders , Petro-Canada said : 
Petro-Canada announced today second quarter earnings from operations of $ 455 million , which include a positive adjustment of $ 96 million for Canadian income tax rate changes . 
Thus , a single company got a $ 96 million tax reduction . 
Shell Canada got a $ 54 million tax reduction and Imperial Esso , a $ 109 million reduction . 
These are sizable amounts . 
My colleague was asking what could justify such a bill . 
Is it to benefit western Canada ? 
I think that , generally speaking , no one benefits from such a situation , except the companies themselves . 
The consumer does not benefit , because we have not seen a reduction of the price at the pumps as a result of these tax reductions . 
Consumers were not intended to benefit . 
Oil companies pocketed the reduction and I believe the answer to that can be found in the comments made by Mr. Neil Smith , a member of the Certified General Accountants ' Association of Canada , who said , regarding the ways and means notice that resulted in the bill before us today , and I quote : 
The release came on the heels of a significant lobbying effort by the resource sector for federal corporate tax rate reductions . 
There were many statements . 
We know how things are within the Liberal Party of Canada . 
It lends a more attentive ear to people who contribute generously to its campaign . 
Eventually , they get rewarded . 
The government is offering a tax reduction to companies posting huge profits . 
Such a reduction is hard to explain , especially when the federal government is saying : `` We need money for health care , and the surpluses will certainly not be large enough to pay the provinces what we owe them . '' 
Oddly enough , on the one hand it does not have the $ 3 billion surplus it promised the provinces , and on the other it reduces taxes on oil companies by $ 250 million . 
Somewhere , someone is being inconsistent and lying to the people . 
If the government really wanted to pay the provinces the money it owes them for health care , it would not restrict its ability to do so by decreasing its own revenues and giving tax rebates to oil companies , who really do not need them to survive . 
Nobody is worried about their survival and I believe they are in good shape . 
It is a good thing they are doing well and it is only right that they pay their fair share of taxes since the public as a whole should enjoy the benefits of our natural resources . 
I believe the federal government 's legislation is regressive and concentrates money in the hands of those who already have a lot . 
I believe this is unacceptable . 
Hon. Don Boudria : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Several officials , including those at the Table and perhaps yourself , have noted that when I gave my business statement and provided a copy , they were not the same . 
Just to correct the record , while I said Bill C-13 for tomorrow , that is not correct . 
It is Bill S-13 and the written copy I submitted said Bill S-13 , respecting the census . 
The Deputy Speaker : I thank the hon. minister for that clarification . 
Mr. Serge Cardin ( Sherbrooke , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask a question of my colleague . 
There are aspects of this bill that create a new tax structure in the resource sector , including with regard to the mining industry . 
We heard several colleagues talk about the environment . 
According to my colleague from Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques , how does the environmental aspect fit in with this government policy , which tends to favour the oil industry ? 
Mr. Paul Crête : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for Sherbrooke for his question , which is indeed very relevant . 
We are at a stage where the Minister of Industry must answer as to how he is going to implement Kyoto . 
Members opposite tell us that it is sometimes difficult to find the money . 
It will take more years to achieve the targets when a fundamental principle , called the polluter pays principle , could have been put in place immediately . 
Instead of giving tax breaks to oil companies , the government could have decided that the money from these taxes would be used specifically for the environment . 
We would not have expressed all this criticism today regarding the fact that the money from the tax cut goes directly into the pockets of shareholders . 
At a time when sustainable development is becoming increasingly important , the federal government is sending the opposite message to Canadians . 
It says that we should continue to do as we did in the past , look only at maximizing profits and not pay attention to how money is distributed within society . 
The public may pass harsh judgment on this bill , which just looks like the result of intensive lobbying by oil companies . 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln ( Lac-Saint-Louis , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this year there have been catastrophes of immense dimension in Canada . 
Forest fires of untold proportions raged throughout the summer in British Columbia and Alberta . 
We recently heard that the Ward Hut ice shelf off Ellesmere Island in the Arctic detached itself and broke up . 
This is an area the size of the island of Montreal which gives people an idea of its dimension . 
More recently in Nova Scotia , hurricane Juan created a path of tremendous destruction , uprooting trees that were 200 and 300 years old . 
What do those things have to do with Bill C-48 ? 
The relationship is simple ; it is called climate change . 
Yesterday during the vote on Bill C-48 my colleague from Davenport and I stood to vote against the bill . 
We did not do it lightly or lightheartedly . 
These were tough decisions which were not done joyfully . 
In fact we regret them intensely . 
However , as environmentalists , we feel very strongly that there is a total contradiction between the government 's policy toward climate change and our commitments to the Kyoto protocol . 
The objective of Bill C-48 is to further promote the non-renewable energy sector , mainly the oil and gas industry which is a huge contributor to carbon emissions . 
These changes directly contradict the recommendations of the OECD that preferential treatment for the non-renewable sector should be eliminated . 
The same recommendation was made in the 1998 report of the Minister of Finance 's technical committee on business taxation . 
The Department of Finance technical study dated March 3 , 2003 justified additional tax cuts which led to Bill C-48 . 
It is interesting to note that there was no reference at all to the environmental or social costs of extraction of resources . 
I would like to quote some very startling figures . 
I can vouch that they are official figures . 
The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development stated that direct government spending on non-renewable energy has been $ 202 million a year .  Over five years this amounts to $ 1 billion . 
Between 1998-2002 , the oil sands tax expenditure was approximately $ 597 million , over five years . 
The oil and gas investment tax credit amounted to $ 128 million .  Over five years this amounted to $ 640 million . 
Over the last five years approximately $ 2.9 billion has gone into subsidies to oil and gas , and Atomic Energy of Canada for nuclear power . 
In 2000 the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development published a report on the energy sector . 
I would like to quote from section 3.86 in the conclusion of the report : 
Two important ways to address climate change are using energy more efficiently and establishing a more sustainable mix of energy sources , which means a greater reliance on renewable sources . 
The federal government stated in its 1996 renewable energy strategy that it wants to increase investments in renewable energy . 
It has also said for many years that it wants Canadians to use energy more efficiently , and the Office of Energy Efficiency is currently promoting this goal . 
It is also stated in section 3.68 of the same report : 
The tax system does not give any preferential treatment to certain investments that improve energy efficiency . 
In other words , we are loading the dice in favour of favourable tax treatment to the non-renewable energy sector , the fossil fuel sector , while not providing any favourable tax treatment to the renewable sector . 
The same report mentions in section 3.36 the various types of federal support to the non-renewable industry the following : 
Since 1970 , the federal government has written off $ 2.8 billion of its investments and loans for energy projects in the non-renewable sector . 
I repeat , $ 2.8 billion . 
I get the very strange feeling that we are speaking out of both sides of our mouths . 
On one side we are talking about Kyoto and climate change , putting large amounts of money , $ 3 billion in the last two budgets , into energy efficiency , the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and a reduction of carbon emissions into the atmosphere . 
This is a good side of it . 
On the other side we are presenting Bill C-48 to promote the accelerated use of fossil fuel resources . 
It seems to me there is a total contradiction which I must say as an environmentalist I cannot support . 
In fact , this is exacerbated by the feeling that this is an industry with so much clout that it almost dictates policy .  The Prime Minister in relation to Kyoto wrote a letter to the oil and gas industry on July 25 , 2003 . 
One section of the letter states : 
4 . 
Other environmental regulations : The `` business-as-usual '' reference for intensity targets will take into account future federal environmental regulations . 
A consistent approach across all federal policies will avoid imposing a greenhouse gas penalty on mandated actions to improve environmental performance . 
This letter almost gives carte blanche to the fossil fuel industry to go ahead and continue putting out carbon emissions , that there will be a cap of 15 % put on reductions so that it will not be too drastically affected and it will be able to certainly respect it . 
The feeling is that we are really saying one thing and certainly acting , through bills like Bill C-48 , very much in the other direction . 
My colleague from Davenport , who stood with me yesterday to show our disappointment , displeasure and disagreement with Bill C-48 , was recently at the International Energy Agency in Paris . 
He asked a question about the state of the world 's oil reserves . 
They told him that if no new reserves were identified , the mid-depletion point for oil and gas would be about 2020 . 
Then there would be sufficient reserves for another 20 to 25 years . 
In other words , it goes to show that our oil reserves worldwide are being depleted at a huge rate , considering that transportation and all other uses of energy are multiplying manyfold . 
In regard to gas , the answer regarding the mid-depletion point was 2020 , another 20 or 25 years . 
We are talking about results and targets that will fall in the lifetime of most Canadians . 
This is not something that is one , two or three centuries ahead . 
The mid-depletion is there , next door , in a few year 's time . 
The depletion point for oil worldwide might be 2050 . 
What conclusion should we draw from this ? 
The conclusion we should draw is that we do not say let us not use our oil resources . 
Of course not . 
We have to and we must . 
At the same time we are saying to the oil industry and to the government , surely a slower depletion rate would be far better for our economy and we could keep our reserves longer . 
At the same time , it would open the way for parallel stream which we must push with far more vigour . 
We need a parallel stream of renewable energies , such as wind , solar , biomass and cogeneration . 
While we slow down the depletion of our oil reserves , we accelerate the pace of our renewable energies . 
When the oil reserves are depleted in 25 , 30 or 50 years , we will have a thriving renewable energy sector such as is in the making in places like Germany and Denmark where wind power has become a very positive , constructive and important fact of life . 
The Danes have made a policy to replace all their coal and oil energy with wind power in 30 years . 
It seems to me that we have to embark on an overall strategy , 25 or 30 years along , to put the accent more on favourable tax treatment in favour of renewable energies and to disfavour the fossil fuel sector so that it depletes itself far more slowly . 
Rather , we are doing everything to accelerate depletion and are giving more profits , subsidies and incentives to the fossil fuel industry . 
I would like to quote from a text from Foreign Affairs of July/August 2003 , by three highly credible Americans : Tim Worth , president of the United Nations Foundation and a former U.S. senator from Colorado ; Boyden Gray , partner of Wilmer , Cutler and Pickering and served as counsel to former president , George H.W. Bush , the present president 's father ; and John D. Podesta , a visiting professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center and was chief of staff to former president , Bill Clinton . 
I recommend to my colleagues to read this article which is entitled `` The Future of Energy Policy '' . 
I will quote from it . 
It states :  The time has come to craft a long-term , strategic approach to energy . 
A central feature must be public-private coalitions for change that bring together business , labor and environmental advocates . 
The first step must be to focus on what is important and define what needs to be accomplished . 
Three far-reaching , 25-year goals encapsulate America 's long-term interests and should guide its energy policies . 
First , America should address its dependence on oil by cutting U.S. oil consumption by a third , setting an example for the rest of the world and breaking the grip of the global oil cartel . 
Second , to take on the dangers faced by the world 's climate , America should cut its carbon emissions by a third as a stimulus to a two-thirds global reduction by the end of the century . 
Finally , the United States should develop , deploy , and disseminate clean energy technologies and institute trade policies that can increase the access of poor people around the world to modern energy services and agricultural markets . 
Such moves will improve the lives of billions of people , stimulate economic growth and create new markets for American goods and services . 
In the course of this article , it points out that in regard to energy , of which we consume far too much , of the six billion people in the world , two billion do not know what electricity is . 
We just flick a switch and put on our lights . 
We just get into our cars and they go . 
Two billion people in the world do not even have electricity . 
In closing , I would like to also quote from the same article . 
It states : 
A strategic energy policy will unite diverse political constituencies and forge common cause among stakeholders that are often at odds . 
The environmental community 's objective is not to shut down coal , it is to shut down carbon ; zero-carbon coal thus is something to agree on . 
The automotive and oil industries ' objective is to not to prop up dictators in the Middle East or to sully the natural world , it is to provide a return to their shareholders ; making fuels , cars , trucks and buses that are clean and profitable thus is something to agree on . 
Most of all , a collaborative strategic approach holds out hope for ending dependence on oil , eliminating excess carbon dioxide emissions , and providing clean and reliable energy services and agricultural opportunity to the world 's poor . 
The result would be to `` hurry the future '' by unleashing a torrent of innovation that will stimulate economic growth , create new jobs , improve productivity , and increase prosperity and security for the United States and the world . 
These same words could apply to us here . 
It is not through bills like Bill C-48 that we will achieve this . 
With great forethought , a strategic policy that will look ahead and base itself on clean energies while depleting our fossil fuel reserves , which we need , with far less speed will achieve this . 
I hope that many of my colleagues will join us in voting against Bill C-48 . 
Mr. Marcel Gagnon ( Champlain , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I commend the member for Lac-Saint-Louis for his speech . 
Having served with him in the Quebec National Assembly , I know he has always been concerned about the environment . 
When he was minister of environment in the Quebec government , this really was an issue of concern for him . 
I do not remember the exact figure , but at the Quebec conference that two ministers of this government attended , as well as other members and myself , World Bank specialists told us that the greenhouse effect was almost catastrophic around the globe . 
They mentioned that an incredible number of people on this planet did not know anything about electric energy and the member for Lac-Saint-Louis was said that also . 
These people work with hard energy , like coal and wood , which explains why between 15 and 20 % of the sun 's rays are not reaching the earth on a whole continent . 
This creates major environmental problems , as the member for Lac-Saint-Louis also pointed out . 
When I hear a speech like this one , or the one by the member for Davenport , I wonder how it is that we are studying such a senseless bill , one that is so remote from environmental concerns . 
How is it that , in 2003 , we cannot get any reaction from the government when we say that this bill has to be withdrawn ? 
We have to take what is being given to the oil companies to do exactly what the member for Lac-Saint-Louis was proposing , conduct research on renewable energy . 
I am asking the member for Lac-Saint-Louis what we can do together to get the government to take action along these lines . 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln : 
Mr. Speaker , a substantial amount of money , approximately $ 3 billion , has been invested in the Kyoto protocol . 
What I disagree with is this obvious contradiction between , on the one hand , making huge investments in more efficient and cleaner energy sources and , simultaneously , on the other , adopting legislation such as this , which will invest $ 260 million a year for non-renewable energy sources . 
I cannot agree with this . 
This $ 260 million per year is nearly the same amount that has been invested in wind energy over five years . 
Wind energy gets $ 260 million over five years , while , in one year , this bill will put $ 260 million in the pockets of companies developing non-renewable energy sources . 
We have to go back to square one .  We have to reinforce what we have already done extremely well , such as the government 's climate change plan , in which substantial amounts were invested . 
An investment of $ 3 billion is a huge one . 
At the same time , we must not undermine such efforts by doing one thing and then the opposite . 
That is my message . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have enormous respect for the member who is speaking and I always respect members who decide to vote against their party , in this case , on a matter of principle . 
However I have a hard time understanding exactly what the principle is that the member objects to in this bill . 
I understand his environmental concerns and his remarks about the energy industry . 
However I do not understand why he supports a two tier tax system , one for businesses in general and then a higher tax burden for the companies that make enormous investments , take huge risks , apply tremendous technology and employ hundreds of thousands of Canadians that work in the natural resources sector , which has been the heart of the Canadian economy all through our history . 
Why does he support a two tier tax system rather than one which is equitable and does not pick winners and losers in terms of sectors of our economy ? 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln : 
First , Mr. Speaker , I am not alone . 
The OECD itself has recommended that favourable tax treatment for the non-renewable sector should be eliminated . 
In 1998 , the Minister of Finance constituted a task force on business taxation , which also recommended the same thing as the OECD . 
The reason we must have different types of taxation is that we have to look at other issues as well ; we have to look at societal issues . 
The fact is that climate change is a fact of life . 
Just this year , for people living in the west , the forest fires that raged were not just an accident of history . 
The Ward Hunt ice shelf , the size of the Island of Montreal , has detached itself from Ellesmere Island .  It has broken down . 
That is not an accident of history . 
Hurricane Juan flew into Halifax , creating all kinds of damage . 
There is climate change . 
It is a fact of life . 
What we have to do is , on the one hand , foster clean energy technologies . 
We are not saying to put penalties on the oil and gas industry , but the oil and gas industry is flourishing at this time and it does not need any new breaks . 
It does not need another $ 260 million a year . 
We would be far better off to put that additional money into wind energy , where we put hardly any at all , only $ 260 million for five years , so that we develop a new stream of energy . 
Oil reserves , regardless of whether we like it or not , are resources that are going to be depleted . 
I quoted the International Energy Agency , which my colleague from Davenport visited recently . 
It says that the mid-depletion point of world oil reserves is going to happen in 2020 . 
Beyond that , the agency reckons there will be another 20 to 30 years of additional reserves and then there will be depletion unless we find new oil . 
We need to start building another stream of energies . 
We do not say to shut off the oil and gas industry , very far from it . 
I realize that my colleague from Alberta has a vested interested in his province producing a resource that we need today and that we use today . 
And we are happy to do so . 
At the same time , let us not give the industry additional treatment so that it benefits from additional breaks when the time has come to , on the contrary , put new money we might have into a clean energy stream . 
This is really what we recommend : a parallel stream so that when the oil energy resources are depleted in 20 , 30 or 50 years , this other stream will be thriving . 
At one point , coal was the big energy source . 
It was too polluting , so oil started to come on stream . 
At that time there was the same debate that is happening today . 
I have read that then people said oil would never replace coal , but it did . 
We have to prepare for the time when clean energy sources such as wind , solar , biomass and cogeneration will replace oil and gas . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am glad to participate in today 's debate on Bill C-48 . 
I think it is important that we talk about the decisions made in the House which affect the actual economy of the country , not only in the short term but in the long term . 
That is what the bill is about . 
It is a very serious issue : a decision on how to spend our resources . 
There is a series of things governments do to develop the strategies , the tools and the tool chest to move forward with pragmatic programs and services in developing the economy and our communities . 
Part of that is taxation . 
Another part is service fees . 
Another part is through assets we have acquired , and there is also revenue generation . 
The bill is very important , because at a time when we are faced with so many different challenges and problems , we will witness anywhere between $ 1.4 billion to $ 2 billion in assets disappearing over the next five years . 
That revenue stream is so critical when we are missing the opportunity to participate in renewable forms of energy . 
Right now we are focusing on a tax cut for the oil and gas industry , and for others as well , but I will focus on that one . 
It does not take into account the planning that is so desperately needed . 
It is frustrating to stand in the House and hear that there is not enough money for SARS , for the workers or for the economy in Toronto and other areas that were affected by SARS . 
Not just Toronto was affected . 
Tourism was affected in other places because they were tarred by the same image as Toronto . 
People thought all of Canada had SARS . 
Then there are our war widows . 
Canada has 23,000 war widows and we do not have the resources to provide money for them , but we can have money designated as a tax cut for the gas and oil industry . 
We all know about hurricane Juan in Atlantic Canada , forest fires in B.C. and Alberta , and BSE . 
They are all examples of very significant environmental issues that also require assets from the federal government , assets that have not been streamed to the people who need them . 
But the government can find the time and the political will to move toward a tax cut to an industry that has serious repercussions on the people out there . 
It is a very good industry in the sense that all of Canadian society has embraced the oil and gas industry . 
We understand the effects it has . 
It has done some very positive things , but at the same time we are paying some prices . 
My community of Windsor and Essex county is . 
Because of environmental contaminants , many of them related to dioxins , toxic materials spewed out into the rivers and lakes causing environmental degradation and human health concerns , my community of Windsor and Essex country has some of the highest rates of cancer , respiratory diseases and birth defects . 
Now here we are , giving an industry a tax credit when we know we still have some of the worst and dirtiest gas on the planet . 
I have used the example of the Oakville refinery . 
Petro-Canada is closing it down because it would rather produce dirty gas until 2005 and then import oil from Europe and distribute it under its flag . 
Even though it will be another company 's gas , it will just re-brand it as opposed to investing in a plant to produce clean gas and energy products to make sure we have independence . 
I believe that the recent Conference Board of Canada report card on Canada 's health says a lot . 
The conference board itself is an organization that is not necessarily seen as being the most solid in terms of the environment . 
It looks at a multitude of different things . 
It very much takes a cautionary approach to the environment . 
The title of the actual Globe and Mail article about it was , `` Canada 's latest report card has disappointing marks '' . 
I will quote a section of that article : 
Compared with other leading industrial countries , Canada scores high marks on an economic front and does moderately well in areas of education and innovation . 
But its performance on a range of health and social measures falls short of many other countries and Canada is well down the list for its environmental efforts . 
That is important to note , because right now we know that those social , health and environmental rankings can actually be improved with the movement to renewable energy , provided that we have the assets to do so . 
Without those assets , if we diminish our reservoir of capital and our ability to act , then we will have limited choice and limited options . 
I think a good example is the $ 250 million per year going into wind energy . 
That is deficient by far in terms of what we can achieve . 
That is an interesting issue because when the wind energy project in Toronto was completed , it cost just over a million dollars for the actual wind generation capacity to be completed . 
However , it cost over $ 100,000 to ship that unit from overseas because we do not produce them here . 
There is an example to show that if we had an industrial strategy and a committed , strong sense of purpose and conviction on the part of the federal government , we could create that factory here in Canada . 
We could create a commitment among provinces and municipalities and have other tax incentives that help consumers and help business by producing the renewable energy forms if we make it affordable . 
I believe that is where the incentive should be . 
If we really want to talk about how it can affect workers and how it can affect the economy , then this money could be used to lower other types of taxation , which we would all enjoy , and at the same time we could meet our national goal of Kyoto . 
It is something that this country has put a stamp on in terms of the world . 
We were one of the last people to sign it . 
The government was dragged kicking and screaming into it by the Canadian public , but it was done . 
We can actually be a leader . 
I think it is a positive thing to do , and not only for our current situation , because it gives hope and instills in people the idea that we can take control of our environment and have sustainability . 
We can also clean the air and provide an opportunity for our youth to have the things that we are so desperately losing . 
We are desperately losing in regard to some of the health factors and some of the pollution issues that we lack resources to fix . 
Once again , this is a significant loss to the federal coffers for an industry that is going to create some problems for all of us as its product is used . 
That is something that I think is important to note . 
It is really critical when we have long term commitments to something that we have the resources . 
That is not happening with the government . 
I am concerned that the government will not follow through with the Kyoto accord in terms of providing the right resources to make it successful . 
This loss of revenue stream is very important . 
I will return to the Conference Board of Canada and its spotlight on Canada and the environment as reported in the Globe and Mail . 
I note this in particular : 
Canadians take pride in their country 's beauty and resources , but have been `` lulled into a false sense of security about the state of our environment '' , the board says . 
Canada placed a dismal 16th among 24 countries whose data were examined . 
`` Yes , we have abundant resources .. but we are not managing them well enough '' .  That is the comment . 
I think that is clear . 
Because of the natural beauty we have in this country , the size of Canada , its diversity , not only of its people but its topography , and the ability to be on an ocean , on lakes , and in forest areas , I think we sometimes take for granted the things that we do not see . 
This tax cut is for an industry which obviously has played a very pivotal role in creating jobs and in being part of the Canadian drive to be successful , but at the same time it has a byproduct that a lot of people pay a price for .  That byproduct is the pollution that is created and affects human health . 
Even the OECD has recognized that environmental pollutants and toxins and their effects on human health has become not only an environmental issue in itself but an economic issue . 
The OECD is actually rolling out some more policy platforms in order to have the confidence and also , more importantly , to address the issue . 
Quite frankly , an area like ours has the Great Lakes area of concern because of the pollutants and the toxins we have been subjected to . 
For example , that has caused a situation where we have higher rates of learning disabilities among children . 
That ends up not only putting a health factor on a child , but it ends up putting a burden on the family to be productive in society . 
They have to deal more with those special family instances . 
If there are no social programs there because the programs have been cut back over the years , then it hurts their participation in the economy and it makes more people dependent . 
We have to balance these things out . 
It is not about trying to gouge an industry . 
The industry has done well in getting support from the federal government over the years . 
It has had a successful history of lobbying for money and resources and actually was in a partnership as a crown corporation at one point in time . 
That does not take away from the fact that we have to be able to mitigate the problems associated with it . 
That is what this money does . 
The money needs to be in the budget to mitigate those things . 
It is critical . 
The twilight of this industry is coming upon us . 
We cannot be burning fossil fuels forever . 
We do not have unlimited supplies , so we have to introduce more and different technologies . 
Ford Motor Company was on Parliament Hill today showcasing its Ballard hydrogen fuel cell technology at the front doors of this building . 
That takes a commitment of resources from the government . 
A federal green auto strategy would be one of them . 
We just cannot do that without money . 
If we know this situation is developing , we have to reintroduce new sustainable products that will offset that . 
Oil and gas is a very critical issue . 
We have discussed this issue at the industry committee . 
It is not a situation where we have an option about purchasing the product . 
Most people have to use this product in their daily lives , to commute to work , to do social activities or whatever it might be . 
We have a dependency on this product . 
It is part of our lives .  It is part of our culture . 
If we do not introduce something else , or do not work toward that , we are going to be very vulnerable as a nation . 
These funds that are being cut are going to jeopardize those opportunities . 
This is important to know because this is not like any other product ; it is very different because of our dependency . 
We all know the stories about gas prices going up . 
When I was a municipal councillor and gas prices went up , we did not have the money in our budget to pay the difference . 
Where could we get that money ? 
We had to either tax more or cut other programs . 
If we do not invest in a multitude of different environmental projects on sustainable energy , we will make ourselves more vulnerable to those fluctuations . 
Those fluctuations not only hurt municipal governments but they hurt businesses that need a sustainable price in order to predict what their costs are going to be . 
Reducing these tax measures in our budget will make us more vulnerable by not having the necessary consistency . 
The Kyoto accord is tied to this . 
We send a poor message when we say that we are going to reduce our emissions , that we are going to look for cleaner fuels , but at the same time we say that we are going to reduce taxes on this type of industry which is going to have an impact . 
We need funds to develop the alternatives , like a job to job transition strategy so that workers who are affected by a decline or changes in the industry will have other jobs , employment training , programs and services to make that transition . 
We need to have urban transit alternatives to ensure that we have mass scale transportation in the future . 
We need to plan for the proper infrastructure because this infrastructure takes decades to develop . 
Our transit systems used to use electricity . 
The transit systems still in use in Toronto to a certain degree operate on the electrical grid but it was more commonplace before . 
In fact the city of Windsor had the first electric street trolley . 
Ironically the oil and gas companies actually purchased a lot of those systems and eventually put them out of business . 
We need green tax reforms . 
We need incentives so that consumers can purchase products with reduced taxation . 
We need incentives that will get the cleaner technologies on the streets so people see those things . 
We do not need a big bureaucratic structure . 
What we need is a reduction in taxes or an elimination of different services . 
We need to facilitate the introduction of green products into society . 
Another good example would be the home wind energy products . 
There are solar powered shingles which are not affordable right now because they are not in mass production . 
I believe these revenue streams should be dedicated to lowering those costs so consumers can get them on the street and they can make a difference . 
We have done that to some degree with automobiles . 
Provincially there was a tax rebate for cleaner technology , hybrids . 
It is not enough because there is still about a $ 5,000 difference in price for a cleaner vehicle , so it is not close enough . 
We have to narrow that gap . 
How do we narrow that gap ? 
We need to have resources . 
That is why we should kill this bill . 
We should stop it from going through . 
We should send a message that these revenues will go to building a sustainable economy , one that is healthy . 
In that way we will send a positive message to the world that we are moving to cleaner technology . 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I understand the member 's concerns and I share many concerns with regard to the environment . 
However , this bill deals with taxation . 
The fact is that his New Democratic friends in the province of Saskatchewan , where the oil and gas and the potash industries are , will benefit from this . 
His NDP cousins in the province of Saskatchewan support this legislation . 
The working people in Saskatchewan , many of them in these industries , will benefit because of this legislation . 
Here an NDP member is standing up and saying we should scrap the bill . 
The member talked about the environment . 
In fact , this bill will assist . 
As I said this will put the non-renewable energy sector on the same plane as others . 
The fact is we are doing lots with regard to the environment but this is not the forum , I would say with due respect to the member , as this bill deals with taxation issues which are going to put our mining companies and our oil and gas companies on an equal footing . 
I point out to him that with respect to the Kyoto commitment , the oil sands industry will be called upon to make significant contributions to a 55 megatonne emission reduction target through the large industrial emitters program . 
It goes on . 
He knows about the $ 2 billion commitment of the government on Kyoto , et cetera . 
The reality is let us not mix apples with oranges . 
This is a taxation bill .  It is going to benefit provinces like Saskatchewan . 
I assume that he has not talked to his colleagues in the province of Saskatchewan because they support this bill and so do other provinces . 
I talked about that before . 
I would like the member to comment on that . 
Mr. Brian Masse : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to address the comments about this not being the forum . 
I would suggest to the hon. member that he take that up with his colleagues who have been in the House of Commons today speaking against the bill , including the chair of the environment committee , as well as other distinguished politicians who have had many years of service in the country . 
They have eloquently identified that Kyoto has a significant connection to this bill . 
It sends the wrong message . 
A little while ago , there was a very good discussion about that fact . 
I do not think the member can say that this is not the forum .  This is the forum . 
There is a connection between the use of this product and the effects it has not only on our community but on the world . 
There is also an effect on the revenue stream that is available to the government to be able to make decisions . 
We hear time and again in the House that the government does not have the money . 
Last night when we voted on a bill , we heard that there was no money for volunteer emergency workers to get a tax credit . 
There is no money for those things but there are billions for this . 
There is no money for SARS compensation for workers . 
There is no money for Atlantic Canada , or it never shows up . 
There is no money for forest fires , BSE , infrastructure , all of those things . 
It is ironic that we are talking about this issue . 
There is a relationship between the use of this product and roads and services . 
Right now the government is considering giving part of the gas tax to municipalities . 
It is talking about this , finally after all this time . 
It could certainly have put this money toward hard infrastructure . 
A lot of the vehicles that use this product are having problems moving about because the government has not put enough in to help with the $ 56 billion deficit in infrastructure . 
The provinces have long been cheated out of transfer payments . 
That is the reason they are struggling for resources , that and downloading . 
We have seen what has happened to the provinces and the municipalities because of downloading . 
Of course they want resources . 
The government has been swimming in surpluses . 
It has been doing boondoggles like the long gun registry . 
Yet it does not have any resources to distribute to the other levels of government while it usurps their taxes . 
That is why they are asking for more resources . 
Mr. Marcel Gagnon ( Champlain , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , after hearing the comments from our colleague on the other side , we understand why the member for Lac-Saint-Louis says that conflicting decisions are being made . 
On the one hand , we signed the Kyoto Protocol and we feel it is urgent that we work on reducing greenhouse gas emissions . 
Anyone who cannot see the urgency of the situation is not playing with a full deck ; just think of all the disasters happening around the world . 
In spite of all that , some still think we are creating jobs . 
Of course , we are creating jobs because of the forest fires . 
We are creating jobs in areas where we are destroying the planet . 
It is dispiriting to hear a member of Parliament speak like our colleague from the other side . 
However , I do want to thank the member for Windsor West , who clearly cares about the environment . 
It is really not very brilliant to say that the $ 250 million given to these companies will have no effect on the environment and will create jobs . 
I can assure you that the $ 250 million invested elsewhere would also create jobs , but jobs for the future . 
Let me give an example . 
There is in my riding a company called Marmen . 
This company builds wind generators and sells them worldwide . 
The demand is very strong . 
We would like to develop the port in Cap-de-la Madeleine to make it easier to ship those wind generators , but National Harbours has no money for that . 
They do not have the $ 2 million or $ 3 million needed to build a wharf on the river , in Cap-de-la-Madeleine , to help this company sell wind generators . 
Marmen creates hundreds of jobs in the renewable energy sector . 
This really is money well invested . 
I had a question for the member for Windsor West , but I will get to it later . 
I will just make some comments . 
I would like to congratulate him , but I will not congratulate the Liberal member opposite who asked a question . 
It is not smart at all to say such things . 
It is not too smart either to support the bill now before the House . 
I would like the member for Windsor West to tell us what we could do with the $ 250 million that we are giving to the oil and gas companies , which do not need it at all . 
What research could we conduct ? 
He mentioned Toronto and Montreal , two cities that have real pollution problems . 
I would like to hear his comments on this . 
Mr. Brian Masse : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for the question and for his eloquent and passionate speech . 
What would we do with $ 250 million ? 
We could do a lot of things . 
The first thing I would do is make sure our war widows actually receive the support they need to live in their own homes with the dignity and integrity they so deserve . 
That is the one thing we should do right away without any hesitation . 
I personally would like to debate a lot of things on which we all need to get together and debate . 
I had a private member 's motion , which failed to pass this week , that called for the creation of a process for the federal government to assist in the clean-up of toxic and environmental contaminated sites and areas where we see pollution and degradation happening . 
I once again point to sustainable technology like wind and solar power . 
Those are good examples of where we could create jobs across the country to build those facilities that would actually produce clean energy and clean jobs . 
Mr. Serge Cardin ( Sherbrooke , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is the second time that I have spoken to Bill C-48 . 
The first time was at the second reading stage , and today we are debating the bill at the third reading stage . 
First I would like to thank my colleagues who took part in this debate , namely the member for Joliette , the member for Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques , the member for Drummond and the member for Champlain who has taken part in this debate with a lot of passion over the last few hours . 
I would say that the debate today has gone in a different direction . 
When we first started to talk about this bill , there were two easily identifiable aspects , namely energy and mining . 
In my last speech , I started to address the environmental aspect , but today I was pleasantly surprised to see the member for Davenport and the member for Lac-Saint-Louis bring the environmental dimension into this debate . 
I also heard comments from other members , one being I think the secretary of state , who said that the cuts were good for businesses , for development , for employment , and so on . 
It is almost as if the government were saying that it would reduce taxes on cigarettes or alcohol , but it does not because it must invest in anti-tobacco campaigns , saying that people must quit smoking because it is not good for their health , and it continues to collect taxes on alcohol , saying that people must drink responsibly . 
In the energy sector , we know that oil causes a lot of pollution . 
There are `` catastrophic '' consequences for the entire planet . 
We are talking about the environmental aspect , but maybe I should go back to the financial aspect , both on the energy side -- oil -- and on the mining side . 
Recently , I read in the June 28 , 2003 issue of the Trois-Rivières Nouvelliste an article by Hubert Reeves , who painted a very sad picture of the state of the earth . 
In his most recent book published in March 2003 , the astrophysicist and philosopher Hubert Reeves voices his concerns about the behaviour of governments . 
They always have their eyes on the next election instead of managing for the long term ; this is especially true of this Liberal government . 
Governments can look like a chicken without a head .  You do not know where it is heading . 
It goes all over the place , darting every which way and leaving a trail of blood behind it . 
Currently , it is even worse , there are actually two chickens going here , there , and everywhere 
While the government is lowering taxes on oil companies , the earth is hurting . 
Its health is getting worse . 
We have learned over the last few months , or even the last few years , that the most important element in our society is health . 
Of course , if we want to be healthy , we must live in a healthy environment on a healthy planet . 
Otherwise , in a few years we will have to post a sign saying `` Earth for sale , garage sale '' . 
Mr. Reeves said also that there are indeed solutions , starting with the development of clean , renewable energies . 
So the money that is given to the oil companies could easily be used to develop clean and renewable energies , even though Mr. Reeves acknowledges that it would take major investments on the part of politicians and business people who manage the day-to-day affairs of the nation with short-term profits as their goal . 
But on this planet , we must work together with the earth and in the same direction . 
We should not be afraid of investing . 
If we do not do it , who else will do it ? 
Mr. Reeves said that in the end , it is every citizen 's responsibility to act ; indeed by doing such things as recycling domestic waste each one of us as an individual can help stop the degradation of the planet . 
Again , all that money , some $ 260 million , which is left in the pockets of oil companies , could be invested elsewhere . 
The member for Lac-Saint-Louis also talked about fossil fuels in terms of reserves . 
He was talking about a 50-year horizon , of course , but it depends on our sources . 
If we ask Mr. Bush of the United States , he would probably say 200 years . 
I imagine that one of his reasons for going into Iraq was that there are reserves that have not been found or exploited . 
However that may be , looking at our current consumption in North America , that is , Canada and the United States , Mr. Reeves says that we use 12 times as much energy as necessary . 
In Western Europe , it is 5 times more , while one-third of humanity is well below the norm . 
It is this over-consumption that must be reduced in order to alleviate energy constraints . 
Therefore , we could use that $ 260 million for advertising , to persuade people that we should stop using petroleum fuels the way we do today , for moving about and staying warm . 
We know that there are many kinds of renewable energy already at hand . 
One of the major sources will always be the sun . 
Mr. Speaker , I know that you must absorb a lot of sunshine in order to be able to cast so much light on our deliberations . 
That is why you inspire me . 
Of course , in the context of sustainable development , I believe the government would have been better off to take these sums of money and reinvest them in awareness and research . 
We have heard a lot about wind power today . 
I think I have already remarked that some of the hon. members on the other side of the House do not know yet whether it is the wind that turns the vanes or the vanes that make the wind . 
But one thing is certain , we know that it is a source of renewable energy that should go on forever . 
Certainly , there are mechanical aspects and of course , there is always some maintenance , but it is still renewable energy . 
Some might say that it is less than good for the visual environment , but at least we can breathe it in . 
And any over-supply will always refresh us . 
I must return to the basics of this bill . 
It is a fiscal bill . 
A few years ago , the government decided to reduce corporate tax rates from 28 % to 21 % for all industries except , of course , the petroleum and natural resource industries . 
Others had also wondered about the principles of justice and fairness with respect to corporate income tax rates . 
What kind of justice and fairness are we talking about when we basically do not want companies to increase their sales ? 
No restriction policies were set , but a rate existed . 
The income tax rate was lowered to help the rest of the economy . 
However , surely the legislator realized at the time that decreasing oil companies ' taxes might have a less pleasant or positive impact on the entire energy sector and , of course , on the environmental sector . 
To make up for reducing taxes from 28 % to 21 % , the 25 % allowance was also eliminated . 
In this context , the oil companies would have lost out in all this tax reform . 
Nonetheless , it is now known that there might be deductions for royalties . 
Look at Petro-Canada , for instance .  If I am not mistaken , the government is still a shareholder and indirectly will receive a larger return on its investments if it pays less tax . 
Let us look at Petro-Canada : in 2002 Petro-Canada received $ 227 million in royalties . 
If it maintains the same level of royalties in 2003 , it will have saved nearly $ 7.5 million . 
So , when they talk about going from 28 % to 21 % , with the 25 % allowance eliminated , the oil companies would definitely have taken a hit . 
Naturally , tax deductible royalties are being reintroduced . 
As has been said several times today , the Minister of Finance also estimates it will cost close to $ 260 million once the reform is fully implemented . 
Something does not add up : reform will be fully implemented over five years , from 2002 to 2007 . 
If the oil companies ' earnings are any indication , things are going much faster than expected , and much faster for some than for others . 
In its quarterly report to shareholders , Petro-Canada had announced second quarter earnings of $ 450 million . 
That includes a $ 96 million adjustment related to changes in the corporate tax rate . 
Shell Canada reached almost the same figure , because all our accountants use the same generally accepted accounting principles . 
Shell was entitled to the same tax treatment as other companies . 
There are deferred taxes , but I am not going to launch into a lesson on that subject , because it is quite technical . 
Also in the second quarter , Shell Canada reported , on July 23 , 2003 , profits of $ 178 million . 
These results include a one-time benefit of $ 54 million from a revaluation of future income tax on profits followingannounced changes to income tax on profits . 
So that is about $ 150 million for these two companies : Petro-Canada and Shell . 
We must not forget Esso-Imperial . 
In its report to shareholders for the second quarter , the tax rate reductions enacted by the federal government and the provincial government in Alberta and settlement of various tax matters benefited results , mainly in the resources segment , by $ 109 million . 
So we have $ 150 million , $ 109 million and $ 250 million . 
In August , the newspaper headlines read , `` Oil and gas companies get lucrative gift from Ottawa '' . 
We learned that the oil and gas companies were getting $ 250 million . 
Around the same time , people were emptying their wallets to put gas in their tanks because of the pump prices . 
As a result , the public has a strange view of the federal Liberal government ; it is like two chickens whose heads have just been cut off and are running all over the place . 
These oil and gas companies announced their profits and the $ 250 million tax cut , and the government told us that , ultimately , it will be $ 260 million ; so we can presume that this will increase to a quarter of a billion and perhaps soon a half a billion dollars . 
This money is going to the oil and gas companies ; the mines have been left out , because they are in a very different situation . 
The mining industry is facing serious problems . 
Simply reducing the tax rate from 28 % to 21 % or simply eliminating the tax credit and adding the deductions for royalties was too little for most of the mining industry . 
Since mines were penalized quite heavily , it was decided that a new 10 % tax credit would be established for eligible mineral exploration expenses , but this applies only to metals and diamonds . 
This does not apply to the oil and gas industry iin any way . 
I was talking earlier about generally recognized accounting principles . 
Indeed , in CAmagazine , which is the official magazine of the Institute of Chartered Accountants , we read the following : 
From a federal tax perspective there will be winners over the phase-in period -- companies with high royalty rates , such as oil and gas producers operating in Western Canada .. However , in such provinces as Saskatchewan , Manitoba , Quebec and the Maritimes , the elimination of the resource allowance deduction for companies that benefited from the resource allowance results in an increase in the overall effective rate . 
The government also talked today , possibly to make up for this shortfall , about bringing this up to 20 % . 
Then , my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois were accused of suggesting a 10 % , 14 % and 20 % increase , I think.They were accused of this and were almost called every name in the book . 
Frankly . 
They suggested roughly the same increase rate or increase increment that the government is suggesting with regard to the 10 % , and in the same way . 
In the long run , these measures are expected to be profitable for all sectors of the economy . 
In the short term , however , some sectors will win and others will lose . 
Among the winners will be businesses working in tar sands , petroleum and precious metals . 
I have just heard someone say that tar sands are easy to work without excessive pollution . 
We probably have not been reading the same environmental analyses . 
Among those who stand to lose are the natural gas , potash and diamond industries . 
However , Hugues Lachance , senior tax director with KPMG , says the following : 
With the first two provisions in this bill , the oil companies would be losers . 
But these are not the only changes . 
The petroleum industry pays substantial provincial and crown royalties . 
In 2007 , they will be able to include 100 % of these provincial royalties as expenses . 
Still , for the mining industry , where royalties are generally small , this third provision of the bill does not lighten their tax burden very much . 
The bill 's actual impact will be that the Canadian oil and natural gas industry will be paying lower taxes than in the states of Alaska or Texas . 
The 2002 tax rate in Canada the rate is now 42.1 % and , with the federal government proposals , the rate will drop to 30.1 % . 
So we can see there is a marked improvement for the oil and gas companies , at the expense of the environment and sustainable development of course . 
This is nothing new . 
Government investments in oil and gas are enormous . 
I would remind hon. members in closing that this is why they have had enough . 
It could all be terminated , with the money invested instead in sustainable development and renewable energy sources . 
In the past 30 years , Canada has put $ 66 billion in direct subsidies into oil , gas and coal , all forms of energy that are directly responsible for climate change . 
Quebec taxpayers have therefore each put $ 27,000 into hydrocarbons , while we ourselves use hydroelectric power , which is non-polluting . 
We will , consequently , be voting against Bill C-48 . 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when we as parliamentarians pontificate about energy and about this proposed small tax reduction for those companies that produce energy , we should try to keep it in perspective . 
I am sure no one in the country cheered when the power went out a couple of months ago . 
No one said that it should be left off so it does not pollute the air . 
That did not happen at all . 
Everybody was clamouring for the power to be restored . 
Canadians are privileged to have such massive amounts of energy available at such a reasonable price . 
I would like to point out to parliamentarians that a reduction in tax rates does not necessarily mean a reduction in revenue . 
It is a very simple product . 
We can sell more for less per unit and actually get more money , and hence more revenue for the government . 
This is not a tax break that will take away revenue for other programs but will in fact increase revenue . 
We also need to think about the magnitude of the energy problem . 
I remember one day when I was driving my motorcycle and , like an idiot , I ran out of gas . 
Instead of my motorcycle carrying me , I had to push my motorcycle to the next service station . 
I then realized how much energy that little motor cranked out because I was huffing and puffing like an old man by the time I reached the gas station . 
It took a lot of energy just at walking speed to move that bike , whereas the bike moves me up to 100 kilometres an hour or faster , but I will not go any faster . 
We have no idea of the quantity of our energy . 
I would like the member to respond about the total energy picture and the fact that we are efficiently converting our natural resources into energy in huge volumes . 
Mr. Serge Cardin : 
Mr. Speaker , basically , the hon. member is saying that I was right . 
I would like to digress a little to comment on what the member has just said . 
He told the House that a reduction in tax rates does not mean a reduction in revenue , not if we sell a lot more . 
In fact , that is exactly what I was saying at the beginning . 
The more we sell , the more we pollute . 
And the more we pollute , the more we will need to invest to meet the Kyoto targets . 
It takes a lot more gas to drive a motorcycle at 200 miles an hour or at 200 km an hour . 
Therefore , there should be a special tax on speed so that the member can do more to help us clean up the planet and meet the Kyoto targets . 
That is exactly what I was saying . 
What would promoting the sale of petroleume products bring us ? 
Just more pollution . 
Our reserves will decrease faster . 
To all intents and purposes , oil and gas should become a secondary source of energy . 
There are things that cannot be done with renewable and clean energy . 
Oil and other pollutants should become secondary sources of energy . 
We should focus on renewable energy so that we have something to turn to the next time we have a blackout . 
I know that the problem in Ontario is probably not linked to a lack of energy , since they have 20 reactors generating energy . 
Nuclear energy is another issue we should be addressing . 
There is probably a technical problem somewhere , which would explain why , as we have noticed in some discussions , the federal government is thinking about investing in electricity in Ontario , something it never did in Quebec . 
Renewable energy is still the best investment , and oil and gas should always remain a secondary source of energy . 
Mr. Marcel Gagnon ( Champlain , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rose many times during this debate to make some comments and ask questions on this very interesting subject . 
Being an accountant , my colleague from Sherbrooke knows very well what can be done with money . 
He is very good at counting . 
An hon. member : He is a good accountant . 
M. Marcel Gagnon : He is indeed a very good accountant . 
It has been said that the $ 250 million will help the oil and gas companies pollute more .  Instead of increasing research on renewable energy , we are going to increase pollution from fossil fuels . 
If the government really does not want to invest the $ 250 million in renewable energy research , there are a few other things I could suggest . 
I toured Quebec in the course of my study on the guaranteed income supplement . 
The member for Sherbrooke knows what I am talking about , because I attended a meeting with him in Sherbrooke . 
We discovered something really incredible and interesting . 
I learned that , for years , 68,000 Quebeckers have been deprived of the guaranteed income supplement . 
Older women in particular were affected . 
You know that 64 % of women over the age of 65 live on less that $ 10,000 a year . 
The government took the money from the guaranteed income supplement . 
If it does not know what to do with the $ 250 million that it is now giving so generously to companies that do not need it , it could maybe think about using the money to reimburse Canadian seniors who were deprived of this essential income . 
I would like the member for Sherbrooke , who dealt with one of these cases personally , to tell me if he would agree that it would be much more effective to use the $ 250 million for this rather than giving it to the oil companies . 
Mr. Serge Cardin : 
Obviously , Mr. Speaker , looking at things in a general way , a government must be responsible and correct mistakes that were made . 
The federal Liberal government made a huge mistake in withholding the guaranteed income supplement from seniors . 
Naturally , the government did what it had to do to find these people and do them justice . 
But , when I am asked , I still have to be honest . 
Will these tax cuts given to oil companies prevent the government from reimbursing the guaranteed income supplement to those from whom it was withheld ? 
I think that these people must receive the money to which they are entitled . 
But the tax cuts given to oil companies will hurt another government activity that has to do with the oil industry , and that is investing in renewable energies . 
A government must be responsible , and this is exactly what this government is not doing . 
The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing , and that creates total chaos . 
This brings me back to what I was saying earlier about the two headless chickens that do not know where they are going . 
Who gets hurt as a result ? 
The environment and our future , which means the general public and our children . 
Mr. Ken Epp : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to point out that money which goes to those energy producers in the gas and oil industry does not necessarily increase pollution . 
In fact it reduces it . 
I want to tell members about the new Shell Upgrader in my riding . 
It is producing fuel that is much cleaner burning . 
It cannot sell it for more because it has to be competitive in the marketplace . 
I put it into my super efficient vehicle and use a scant five litres every 100 kilometres .  We are polluting way less than we did 20 or 25 years ago . 
That money does not increase pollution . 
It is used for research to reduce pollution . 
Mr. Serge Cardin : 
Mr. Speaker , I must say that the member is right on certain issues . 
If these cuts went directly to the most polluting elements of the oil industry , I would have no choice but to agree with him . 
But if they are used to increase production in terms of quantity and to increase sales , then there is also an increase in use . 
It becomes a vicious circle . 
Again , this is very typical of the government . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
Is the House ready for the question ? 
Some hon. members : Question . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : The question is on the motion . 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
Some hon. members : Agreed . 
Some hon. members : No . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : All those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
Some hon. members : Yea . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : All those opposed will please say nay . 
Some hon. members : Nay . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : In my opinion the yeas have it . 
And more than five members having risen : 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
As requested by the deputy government whip , the recorded division is deferred until Monday , October 20 , 2003 , after government orders . 
Mr. Jacques Saada : 
Discussions have taken place between all parties and there is an agreement to re-defer the recorded division requested on Bill C-48 until the end of government orders on Tuesday , October 21 , 2003 . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
Is that agreed ? 
Some hon. members : Agreed . 
Contraventions Act 
Bill C-38 . 
On the Order : Government Orders 
October 9 , 2003 -- the Minister of Justice -- Second reading and reference to the Special Committee on Non-Medical Use of Drugs of Bill C-38 , an act to amend the Contraventions Act and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act . 
Hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I move : 
That Bill C-38 , an act to amend the Contraventions Act and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , be referred forthwith to the Special Committee on the Non-Medical Use of Drugs . 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak on the motion to refer Bill C-38 to a special committee of the House before second reading . 
I would like to remind the House that , in the Speech from the Throne , the government made a commitment to modernize the Narcotic Control Act . 
Last May , in order to meet that commitment , I tabled a bill which launches a real reform . 
The purpose of Bill C-38 is to change law enforcement in Canada for the possession of a small quantity of cannabis and to increase penalties for the growing of large quantities of marijuana . 
We must make one thing clear right from the start : it was never a question of legalizing marijuana and we are not now legalizing marijuana . 
It remains an illegal substance and offenders will be always be prosecuted and punished by law . 
What we are doing is changing the kinds of prosecution for certain offences by proposing new penalties and alternative procedures . 
The new legislation will ensure that the law will be applied uniformly from coast to coast and will allow us to devote police resources to operations where they will be most useful . 
This bill was not drawn up in a contextual vacuum . 
It is part of Canada 's new drug strategy . 
A sum of $ 245 million was allocated to the fight against the root causes of drug abuse and to the promotion of health . 
The government is increasing the funding for informing and raising the awareness of the Canadian public , especially young people , about the dangers of drugs . 
This decision was made in full knowledge of the facts . 
We have done our homework . 
We have benefited from much research , consultation and debate . 
The research goes back to the LeDain Commission , three decades ago . 
Two recent committee reports have also helped us understand the issue : the Senate 's Special Committee on Illegal Drugs and this House 's Special Committee on the Non-Medical Use of Drugs , chaired by the hon. member for Burlington . 
Clearly , the current law is in need of reform to send a strong message that marijuana is illegal and harmful , but also to ensure the punishment fits the crime . 
We have to ask ourselves as a society whether it makes sense that a young person who makes a bad choice in life should receive the lasting burden of a criminal conviction . 
It means that the doors to certain jobs may be closed or they may have trouble travelling internationally . 
With the reforms that I have introduced , the current criminal court process and resulting criminal penalties would be replaced with alternative procedures and penalties . 
Those convicted of possessing 15 grams or less of marijuana or one gram or less of cannabis resin will receive a ticket and a fine ranging from $ 100 to $ 400 , depending on the circumstances . 
This fine would be higher in many cases than what offenders are receiving now . 
It is important to know that when a young person is facing a charge , his or her parents will be notified . 
Police officers will retain the discretion to give a ticket or summons to appear in criminal court for possession of more than 15 grams of marijuana . 
The maximum in that case will remain a $ 1,000 fine and/or six months in jail . 
In addition , the new alternative penalties regime will not be available in cases of possession of over 30 grams . 
Those offences will result in criminal charges . 
At the same time that we are modernizing our possession offence , we are taking aim at marijuana grow operations . 
We know that these large grow ops are sometimes located in residential areas . 
We know that criminal gangs are often behind those operations . 
This bill sends a clear message that we will not allow our neighbourhoods to be threatened by these grow ops and we will take strong action to combat organized crime . 
Our bill provides for doubling the maximum sentence for large marijuana grow operations . 
It sets out a number of aggravating circumstances which would require courts to provide reasons for not imposing a prison sentence . 
With tougher legislation , and more efficient enforcement measures , we hope to put an end to this kind of activity . 
I would now like to address certain questions that have been raised with regard to this bill . 
First of all , there is the issue of impaired driving . 
This is not a new problem ; I would remind the House that it is already a serious offence under the Criminal Code to drive when impaired by alcohol or drugs . 
Thus , we must give the police the tools they need to identify drivers whose faculties are impaired by drug use . 
The Department of Justice is currently circulating a consultation document prepared by a working group . 
Secondly , there is the question of whether these reforms are reasonable , not only in the Canadian context , but also internationally . 
Let us examine what is happening elsewhere in the world . 
In some countries , possession of small amounts of cannabis is not a crime . 
In others , it remains a criminal offence , but it is not prosecuted . 
Some countries , including the United States , see active prosecution as a key element of their policy response to possession of small amounts of cannabis . 
Although drug enforcement is a shared state-federal responsibility in the U.S. , 12 states have laws decriminalizing possession of small amounts of cannabis . 
The state of South Australia , along with two Australian territories , have adopted fines for possession of up to 100 grams of marijuana . 
Several evaluations to date in South Australia found no increase in cannabis use linked to its policy . 
Similarly , in the U.S. no significant difference in cannabis use was found between those jurisdictions that decriminalized cannabis use and those that did not . 
While we can learn from what others are doing , our reforms are designed to reflect the Canadian reality . 
We are taking a comprehensive approach recognizing that drug and alcohol abuse can take a heavy toll in human terms and cost our economy billions of dollars . 
Earlier I mentioned that this motion would send this bill to committee before second reading . 
This demonstrates that the government is listening and willing to consider amendments to ensure we get it right . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
It is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows : the hon. member for Yorkton -- Melville , Firearms Registry . 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley -- Abbotsford , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to respond to the minister 's speech regarding the decriminalization of marijuana . 
Any drug legislation must be comprehensive in our country . 
For the government to just narrow it all down to decriminalization of marijuana is indeed irresponsible and reckless . 
For four years I have been making every attempt to get the government to move toward a national drug strategy that works at the street level . 
In fact , the government followed a motion that we proposed in the House of Commons to establish a parliamentary committee to look at this issue of drugs . 
We made a number of recommendations and lo and behold , at the time that the recommendations came forward , the government , rather than introduce a drug strategy , decided to throw a few million dollars at the two departments that were not doing a good job , namely , the Department of the Solicitor General and Health Canada . 
The committee found that they did a deplorable job with the drug issue in this country . 
The government put a few million dollars into that and said that we had a drug strategy . 
Now it wants to decriminalize marijuana . 
That is not the way to go . 
We are going to deal with the decriminalization bill , but we are still looking for that drug strategy . 
It is the responsibility of the government to at least acknowledge that there is a need for a drug strategy in the country . 
Merely dealing with the decriminalization of marijuana and not dealing with ecstasy , shrooms , or any other drug is reckless . 
I want to put our position before the House which will be presented in committee . 
We could agree to decriminalize five grams as minor possession of marijuana -- five grams is equal to about seven joints of marijuana -- providing the following conditions are met . 
I must say that any member who stands in the House and says that it could be 10 , 15 or 30 grams must understand that that is not minor possession . 
Individuals holding 15 grams of marijuana on them , which is probably up to 22 or 23 joints , is not minor possession . 
No one needs to carry 15 , 20 or 23 joints with them . 
The conditions that we want to see are as follows . 
We want to see 5 grams not 30 grams because it is 30 . 
The minister says that it is really only 15 because there is a fine and then there is an option of a fine or a conviction from 15 grams to 30 grams . 
The fact is that it is really decriminalization up to 30 grams . 
That is the plan . 
We must have an understanding with provincial governments and the legal industry that they must deal consistently with criminal offences for amounts over the decriminalization amount . 
We do not want to see , as soon as the bill is brought into play , someone getting caught with 18 grams or 32 grams and having the judge say that a criminal conviction will not be given for an extra two grams , and that something will be worked out . 
If we start that all over again , we will be right back to where we started . 
We want a commitment that amounts over the decriminalization amount will be dealt with in the courts consistently throughout the country . 
We want a progressive fine schedule to be in place . 
Fines and penalties will have to increase with the number of convictions . 
I found it quite deplorable that the Prime Minister the other day basically said that he could have a joint in one hand and the amount to pay the fine in the other . 
That is the wrong message . 
The fact is that if one is caught once there is a fine . 
If one is caught a second time there is a bigger fine . 
If one is caught a third time something else happens . 
It has to be progressive . 
A consequence to non-payment of fines must be in place , the point being that if fines are not paid , what happens ? 
Do we just let it go as the communities do in the case of speeding tickets or parking tickets ? 
We want to see something done about that . 
We want to see a national drug strategy put in place , not something merely dealing with the decriminalization of marijuana . 
We want assurances that growing and trafficking marijuana will be criminal offences . 
We are glad to see that in the bill , and it must remain in the bill when it leaves the committee . 
I was glad to hear the minister talk about drug driving laws and roadside assessments being in place , but he talked about a consultative document . 
We want assurances that those things will be in place , not just a consultative document that may be in place at some point . 
In addition , we want to talk to the Americans on this issue in committee . 
We do not need any particular approval from the Americans to do this , but we have to understand that this is a touchy issue at the borders . 
We want some assurances in committee that a dialogue will happen . 
We will be inviting the Americans to talk to us because we want to hear their point of view . 
There is little point in developing a process in this country if we are going to offend everybody south of us . 
I live in a border community and I see the traffic every day and the harm that is done by the inequity of the drug laws in our country . 
There is a problem with the fine schedule in terms of charging youth less for possession . 
That is the wrong message to be sending to our youth . 
We must be consistent with the kind of fines we are going to assess . 
There is work to do . 
My colleagues will support five grams , but the conditions have to be met . 
We will vigorously discuss this in committee . 
Members should not look for the committee to rush this through because we have no intention of doing that . 
We have lots of witnesses to hear from in committee . 
We have many amendments already prepared for the committee .  We do not intend to stall the process of the committee , but the Canadian Alliance will thoroughly analyze and discuss this with young people and others . 
We will thoroughly review the whole process before we give our consent to go ahead . 
Mr. Benoît Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank you for this opportunity to speak to Bill C-38 , which has just been introduced by the Minister of Justice . 
I will say right off the bat that we are in favour of supporting this bill . 
We are confident and we truly believe the minister when he says that in committee he will listen to members and make the necessary changes to better define the bill and make it more effective . 
Our reality reflects the distinct character of Quebec and we want to share it with the minister and the members of the committee . 
We are sure that , as was the case with the Young Offenders Act to a degree , after hearing about those differences and the success we have had in Quebec , together we will be able to improve the bill before us . 
I will talk about our reservations , but on the face of it , the very idea of decriminalizing simple possession is , in our view , the best solution for the short term because it deals with the most important issue by ensuring that people found in possession of cannabis will no longer have a criminal record . 
In our opinion , this option is also one that best balances the need to reduce the harm due to consumption and the need to reduce the costs and problems associated with enforcement . 
Because Bill C-38 is aimed at decriminalizing the simple possession of cannabis , the Bloc Quebecois , as I said , will vote in favour of the bill . 
This option presents many advantages . 
First , such a reform will inevitably result in huge savings in legal costs and other criminal justice system expenses . 
According to various studies , it is estimated that the fact that the simple possession of marijuana is still a criminal offence costs about $ 500 million a year in legal proceedings . 
It costs $ 500 million a year to process arrest cases and follow-ups to cases of simple possession of marijuana . 
Decriminalization could result in a substantial reduction in this cost of $ 500 million . 
If the House will permit , I shall try to explain what decriminalization is . 
Some people , like the Canadian Alliance just now , are very much aware of this issue and so are we . 
Too often , the general public thinks that this bill means that young people , everyone , will be walking around with a joint , and there will be no more problems ; life will be wonderful . 
But that is not it . 
The difference between decriminalization and legalization is simple to demonstrate . 
Let us take an example that is easily understood by everyone listening : the highway safety code . 
If you are going 130 , 140 or 150 km per hour on highway 417 , sometimes there are police around ; if they have you pull over , you are not a criminal , but you have done something illegal and you get a ticket ; you pay the fine and that is the end of the matter . 
If , each time a person did something illegal like not stopping for a red light or speeding , he or she were charged with a criminal offence , and had to appear in court -- each time -- our courtrooms would be even more clogged than they are . 
What the minister is saying with this bill is that simple possession of a certain amount of marijuana is not permitted , it is still illegal . 
I will discuss quantities and sorts at greater length later . 
A person who speeds receives a fine , but not a criminal record . 
I am certain that many parents who are listening to us today have children who have had bad experiences . 
In Quebec , I think that close to 50 % of youth under 18 have had an experience with marijuana or soft drugs . 
Are they future criminals ? 
Yet they get arrested and they get a record . 
What happens when they get a record for making a mistake in their youth and getting caught with a joint ? 
What if , one day , they wanted to go to the United States ?  They would have to get a pardon , which is a big hassle .  If one day they became truck drivers and had to cross the border , they would have serious difficulties . 
If they wanted to become lawyers or police officers , with a police record they would be considered criminals . 
Members of all parties have seen it all too often in their offices . 
This is not a political issue . 
Young adults come and tell us , `` I got arrested 12 years ago , but never thought there would still be a record of that today . 
It is causing me all sorts of problems in my professional life . 
Am I a criminal ? '' 
No , these are not criminals , just young people who made a foolish mistake . 
Our population has to deal not only with soft drugs but also with alcohol . 
Every year , alcohol kills 3.5 million individuals around the world , while tobacco kills approximately 750,000 . 
Even if there are no known cases of cannabis related deaths , this substance remains prohibited . 
How much is spent on alcohol awareness campaigns ? 
I think it will not come as a surprise to anyone if I say that young persons under the age of 18 use it occasionally . 
The same is true of tobacco . 
Both these drugs are legal in our societies , and the social costs associated with them are much higher than those associated with cannabis . 
That is why we think that this Parliament and this society must keep up with the times and ask themselves questions . 
Do we want to continue penalizing our adolescents and young adults by burdening them with a criminal record they do not really deserve ? 
Will we keep overloading our courts with crimes which are not really crimes ? 
Should possession continue to be prohibited ? 
Yes , but under the Contraventions Act , by giving a ticket . 
Simple possession remains illegal , but is no longer criminal . 
That is important to us . 
It is also important that the savings of $ 500 million a year from the tracking of criminal cases be reallocated to a good awareness campaign . 
The minister announced , earlier , plans for a $ 245 million campaign on Canada 's drug strategy . 
We believe , and this belief is based on blatant and tangible examples , that this $ 245 million should go to those who are knowledgeable , at the provincial and territorial level , where they deal directly with the people affected by drug use . 
The $ 245 million is fine , but should be redistributed to the provinces to fund more effective awareness campaigns . 
Why give $ 245 million to the provinces ? 
The firearms program was originally supposed to cost $ 2 million . 
We are now at $ 1 billion plus and the government still has no control over costs . 
With regard to national awareness campaigns against smoking , we still do not know exactly how the federal government is spending the money . 
We only have to look at the results . 
We think that , given these disastrous results , the money must to given to the provinces . 
Consequently , it is worth reminding members that , with this bill , the possession and production of cannabis are still illegal under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act . 
The approach to enforcing the law will be changed . 
It will now be governed by the Contraventions Act . 
A minor contravention will therefore be given to the offenders . 
In what circumstances will these people get a contravention ? 
The possession of 15 grams or less of marijuana would be liable to a $ 150 fine for an adult and $ 100 for a youth . 
For a youth , a $ 100 fine is already high enough that he or she would think twice before doing the same thing again . 
I will provide some facts , since I am almost at the end of my presentation . 
One in 10 Canadians uses cannabis . 
Over 30,000 Canadians are accused each year of possession of cannabis . 
In Quebec , 80 % of the accused are adults , not youth . 
There is one very interesting bit of information . 
Currently , 84 % of the population would be in favour of the legalization of marijuana for therapeutic and medical uses , for example . 
In May 2001 , the Canadian Medical Association said in its review that arresting people for the possession of marijuana has more serious social consequences than the moderate use of the drug itself . 
Thus , arrest is more serious than use . 
Consequently , we will support this bill .  We hope that some corrections will be made , and we think that this is a step in the right direction . 
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin -- Swan River , PC ) : 
Madam Speaker , it is a pleasure to debate Bill C-38 on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party . 
I will begin by asking a question . 
What is the motive behind the government bringing this bill in at this late stage ? 
As most of us in the House know , there are probably another four weeks left before the House rises , at least that is the rumour we hear . 
Is this part of the Prime Minister 's legacy ? 
We are not sure . 
This is serious business we are dealing with right now . 
Another point that needs to be brought out is that we cannot legislate or create legislation based upon popularity or trends , especially when we are dealing with a topic as serious as this one . 
We need to spend a lot of time debating and doing research because something like this will have an an effect on future generations , beyond the time that members in this House spend on it in this session . 
The Supreme Court has three cases right now on which it will render decisions in terms of answering the question as to whether Parliament has the power to control such substances as marijuana . 
There is no reason that this topic cannot wait until after the next election . 
I also heard that the crown prince in waiting has a different attitude toward marijuana than the current government . 
As far as we are concerned , the Progressive Conservative Party would like to see this topic put to rest . 
We can deal with it in the next Parliament . 
Bill C-38 sends the wrong message to current users today . 
I think people need to be concerned that , yes , there are a lot of adolescents and young adults using marijuana , if not on a daily basis certainly recreationally . 
What it would do is reduce the severity of the activity from a Criminal Code breach to that of a parking ticket , actually less than a speeding ticket . 
We call it decriminalization but in essence it is the first step to legalization . 
We are decriminalizing it because we are taking one part of an action out of the Criminal Code and saying that under such conditions it is all right to go ahead and do it . 
In other words , it sends the wrong message . 
We need to deal with this subject from a broad perspective . 
We need to look at the whole realm of drug use , with marijuana being one of them . 
We need to decide whether we want to legalize marijuana . 
It is like the problem we are dealing with now of solicitation and prostitution . 
Little chunks here , little bits there , a little band-aid here does not really work . 
Maybe in the short term it will make some people happy , the ones who are toking up , but in the long term , when we look at the benefits to society , it probably is not the way to go . 
In fact , some basic questions need to be raised . 
Will Bill C-38 decrease the prevalence of harmful drug use ? 
Will Bill C-38 decrease the number of young Canadians who experiment with drugs ? 
Will Bill C-38 decrease the incidence of communicable diseases related to substance abuse ? 
Will Bill C-38 increase the use of alternative justice measures , such as drug treatment courts ? 
Will Bill C-38 decrease the illicit drug supply and address new and emerging drug trends ? 
Will Bill C-38 decrease avoidable health and socio-economic costs ? 
The reality is that if the use of marijuana is treated like a parking ticket , there is no doubt that the marketplace will still exist . 
We must remember that use is driven by market . 
Where there is demand there will be a supply . 
Bill C-38 really does not deal with the big picture . 
We cannot deal with just the user and forget about the supplier of the marijuana . 
We know that in recent times the Americans have criticized Canada for being a little too liberal regarding the use of marijuana , especially in comparison with their zero tolerance drug policy across the line . 
The fact of the matter is it does affect the trade movement , the movement of goods and services , as well as the movement of people between our two countries . 
The Americans certainly do not perceive us in a positive way knowing that the drugs laws in Canada are very liberal and easy . 
I think we need to assess the impact it has on the country as a whole . 
The legislation creates a series of fines , as I indicated . 
The fines are for possession of thirty grams or less of cannabis or one gram of cannabis resin . 
However the fines for each offence are not being uniformly applied . 
Adult fines are higher than those for use , which does not make any sense . 
As well , if the fines are not high , there is hardly a deterrent . 
A concern also exists for reducing fines applicable to youth , especially as the federal government is actively trying to educate young people not to smoke cigarettes or marijuana . 
That is the irony here . 
Even with the use of cigarettes and tobacco today , retailers have to hide their supply behind a curtain so kids who go into the store cannot see them . 
If a retailer sells cigarettes to a minor , the fines are monstrous . 
With alcohol we have the same kind of controls that have been mentioned . 
In terms of the system of fines being the same as a parking ticket , what happens if people do not pay their parking tickets ? 
Obviously the tickets pile up . 
How the system collects will be a huge challenge , not only locally but across provincial boundaries . 
It is easy to say we will write tickets and hopefully they will be paid . 
What if they cannot pay it ?  What if a youth is caught and cannot afford to pay the ticket ? 
Is that ticket just thrown in the garbage ? 
There are no provisions for repeat offenders and no increasing fine scale . 
Each time offenders are fined they simply pay the set amount . 
If the fine is not paid , then it is turned over to a collection agency . 
That is a joke . 
This is hardly an awe inspiring deterrent . 
Imagine breaching the Criminal Code , receiving a fine and then the fine has to be sent over to a collection agency . 
Some U.S. states that have decriminalized simple possession seize an offender 's driving licence for failure to pay fines . 
That makes a lot more sense . 
As well , some states have increased penalties for repeat offenders . 
The aggravated provisions are a maximum penalty of $ 1,000 or six months imprisonment . 
However , there are only three aggravated provisions : possession while operating a vehicle , not driving while drug impaired but simply having marijuana in a car ; possession while committing an indictable offence ; and possession in or near a school . 
More aggravated provisions could have been added such as possession in or near a sports or community centre . 
The MADD organization has serious concerns about Bill C-38 , as well as the police organizations in the country . 
There is a lot more than just saying a person has smoked , he has been caught but we will not make him a criminal . 
Canada expects more from the House of Commons . 
We need to put more time into the bill , rather than rushing it through the House at this time . 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
Madam Speaker , I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak in the debate about Bill C-38 . 
It has been a long time in coming . 
We have had this sort of strange situation where on the one hand it appeared that there was a lot of emphasis to get this bill moving , yet we are only today now debating it and sending it off to committee . 
I would concur with the comments of the member from the Conservative Party who questioned what the government 's real intention was with the bill and whether it would ever see the light of day in terms of something being acted upon , given the time frame in which we are operating . 
It is sort of politics in the twilight zone . 
That aside , decriminalization as a measure to recognize the failure of our prohibitionist policies is something that many people now accept . 
For sure it is better to have a fine than to end up being in jail and having a criminal record . 
However there are a number of problems with the bill . 
While decriminalization is something that we could see as a progressive step forward in dealing with the failure of prohibitionist policies , the bill as it is presents a very contradictory and confused approach . 
On one hand it offers a measure of decriminalization . 
On the other hand the political rhetoric that has been surrounding the bill , and we heard from the minister today , and the system of penalties outlined in the bill actually point to a tougher and a wider enforcement stance . 
I want to put forward the remarks made by Eugene Oscapella from the Canadian Foundation for Drug Policy . 
He has said that the bill really perpetuates the myth that the criminal law can resolve problems related to drugs . 
That is one concern we have . 
The bill relies upon the premise that somehow if we end up even with a system of fines and it is still within the criminal law that marijuana is still an illegal substance , then we are controlling the drug and controlling the use of it . 
As was shown in the special committee report on the non-medical use of drugs , of which I was a member , it became very clear in the evidence that we had that whether a substance was legal or illegal had virtually no impact on its use . 
In fact we would be far better off providing real education for Canadians about drug issues , about the potential health issues related to drug use and focusing our financial and educational priorities on that . 
As we know with smoking , for example , it is not illegal . 
The decrease in smoking has not come about because smoking is illegal . 
It has come about because it has been highly regulated and because we have spelt out what can and cannot be done . 
A vast amount of education has been given to people individually and within society as a whole to make them aware of the dangers of smoking . 
That is with a legal substance . 
The argument of prohibition as a tool for dealing with drug use and the harms that can flow from drug use has been shown to be a failure . 
The Senate report on marijuana came out in September 2002 and it was a very wide-ranging and excellent report . 
The report pointed out that 30 % of the population has used cannabis at least once . 
That is approximately 100,000 Canadians daily . 
In fact of the over 90,000 drug related incidents that are reported annually by police , more than three-quarters of those incidents relate to cannabis , and over 50 % of all drug related incidents involve possession of cannabis . 
That is from the Senate report . 
Given the magnitude of that problem and the use , we have to ask ourselves whether the regime as presented in this bill will respond to the reality of what Canadians are actually doing . 
Certainly one concern we have with the bill is that it does not contain any provision for personal cultivation . 
The special committee on the non-medical use of drugs recommended that there should be some provision not only for possession for personal use but also for cultivation . 
Unfortunately the government chose not to do that so we have this contradictory position where the government is saying that people will get a fine for possession of marijuana if it is 15 grams or less , but they cannot go out and buy it anywhere because it is an illegal act . 
In fact , as Dan Gardner , a critically acclaimed journalist from the Ottawa Citizen , pointed that out in a series of articles he did on the drug issue . 
In his article on May 28 , he said :  Criminologists have often found that lowering , but not eliminating , a punishment results in more punishment . 
It 's called the `` net-widening effect . '' 
Replace charges with fines , and people the police would have let off with a warning and a wave under the old system will instead by hit with a fine . 
In other words , decriminalization could lead to more people being punished , not fewer . 
Then I have an image in my head of the Prime Minister in one hand holding a joint and in the other hand holding his fine . 
What is this actually saying ? 
Are we saying that somehow by having a fine we are trying to give people the illusion that we will be preventing them from using marijuana ? 
We have the Prime Minister saying , `` Oh well , this is the way you do it . 
You smoke a joint , you pay your fine and away you go pretty happy '' . 
What is the purpose of the fine ? 
If it is there as a deterrent , then again the evidence will show that as a deterrent it simply has no use . 
All it becomes is a source of revenue and a widening of police enforcement on the basis that municipalities will now see a way to collect more money . 
I did want to respond to the question put forward by the Canadian Alliance that we had to be very careful about this bill and that we would have to talk to the Americans because it had to do with the borders . 
I know that some Liberal members have been off courting the drug czar and getting all the arguments from the drug czar about why this is so bad . 
I truly believe the objection of the Americans to this bill has nothing to do with border crossings . 
It has everything to do with their political war on drugs , which in effect is a war on poor people , and the fact that they do not want to see Canada take a different kind of approach , an approach that has been successful in Europe in terms of decriminalization . 
That is what their objection is truly about . 
I really do not think it has anything to do with the border . 
It has to do with them not wanting to see another approach that will show the gaping holes and their own failure on the war on drugs . 
We very much look forward to the debate at the committee . 
There obviously will be a whole variety of amendments . 
The NDP members will be introducing amendments because we have questions about the lack of provisions around cultivation .  We have questions about the fines system .  We have questions about the enforcement that underlies this , the fact that it continues this prohibitionist policy and that somehow the criminal law will deal with this issue . 
We certainly look forward to what goes on in the committee and hearing from the witnesses . 
Hopefully the bill can be improved to better reflect the reality of what Canadians want to see , given that the use of marijuana is very prevalent in our society . 
I think there is a very common understanding that we do not want to see Canadians criminalized . 
One other issue we will be bring forward is why there is not an amnesty provision for the approximately 600,000 Canadians who have a criminal record for simple possession . 
There is nothing in the bill that would give relief to people who live under the negative effects of a criminal record , for example , who cannot go across the border . 
I know constituents in my own riding have faced terrible situations because they have a record from simple possession . 
We want to see some of these issues addressed , and we look forward to the debate in the committee . 
Business of the House 
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard -- La Prairie , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Discussions have taken place among all parties and the member for Churchill concerning division on Motion M-400 , scheduled for later today at the conclusion of private members ' business . 
I think that you will find unanimous consent that if a recorded division is demanded at the conclusion of the debate on Motion M-400 today , it be deferred until Tuesday , October 28 , 2003 , at the beginning of private members ' business . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
Is it agreed ? 
Some hon. members : Agreed . 
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard -- La Prairie , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , discussions have taken place among all parties and I believe that you will find consent to re-defer the recorded division demanded on M-197 until Tuesday , October 28 , 2003 , at the beginning of private members ' business . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
Is it agreed ? 
Some hon. members : Agreed . 
Contraventions Act 
The House resumed consideration of the motion . 
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering -- Ajax -- Uxbridge , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I am sorry that I only have three minutes to debate such a substantive issue but such is the case when one tries to rush debates and provide select committees to put important legislation before the Canadian public without proper knowledge of what is occurring . 
I just heard the member and her concern about poor people . 
I think we are all concerned . 
However the hon. member , like many in the House , is completely oblivious and ignorant to the fact that in one out of four marijuana grow ops in this country , of the estimated 50,000 , children live in those homes . 
We understand the implications of those who are farmers and those who are forced to cultivate this product , people who come from other parts of the world and have to pay off the money they owe to the people who brought them to this country , many of whom are of Asian descent and who are kept in a position of enslavement . 
I am willing to talk about this issue , but I think it is important that we understand some of the very important implications . 
In its most recent document Criminal Intelligence Service Ontario states that there are some 15,000 grow ops in the province of Ontario and 50,000 across Canada . 
They produce approximately three million to six million kilograms of marketable marijuana .  The price tag is about $ 12 billion a year . 
If that is the case it would appear to be the largest single cultivation of agriculture product in this country . 
Who controls it ? 
Organized crime . 
Clearly , when we consider that for a $ 25,000 investment we can have a return of $ 600,000 on a given home , is there any wonder there is a proliferation ? 
The legislation is deficient . 
It does not provide minimum sentences . 
It is one of the reasons that the Criminal Intelligence Service of Canada , just a few weeks ago , as the same the Globe and Mail and others were deriding us because we happened to meet with the American officials to talk about a cross-border problem , pointed out that organized crime was leaving the United States in favour of Canada because we want to have some kind of , relatively speaking , easy legislation as it relates to marijuana . 
It is nice to give people a fine for possession . 
My concern is about the infrastructure of this industry . 
While I am on that subject , the fact that there is in this country today , and in this legislation , no provision to provide the equivalent of a breathalyzer test is , in my view , unacceptable . 
It sends the wrong message to individuals . 
It does not protect motorists .  It does not protect people . 
Studies have pointed out very clearly , and I am reading here from several sources , that research has indicated that 5 % to 12 % of drivers may now drive under the influence of cannabis and this may increase as much as 25 % as a result of this legislation . 
It is clear to us that if we want to prevent the carnage we need to do something to address the issue of no protocol as it relates to people who drive cannabis impaired . 
The cross-border issue is a serious one but I am more concerned with the issue of organized crime . 
These people do not have fanciful discussions about benign products , about the utilization of marijuana . 
They are in fact there to make money . 
That money winds up in various other forms of exploitation of the poor , of people who are down and out , of individuals who have no choice but to follow the dictates of organized crime . 
When one considers $ 12 billion -- 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
I am sorry to interrupt but the hon. member will have seven minutes when we resume debate on this motion . 
It being 5:30 p.m. the House will now proceed to the consideration of private members ' business as listed on today 's Order Paper . 
Private Members ' Business 
Bankruptcy Legislation 
The House resumed from June 5 consideration of the motion . 
Mr. Gary Schellenberger ( Perth -- Middlesex , PC ) : 
Madam Speaker , I would like to commend the hon. member for Churchill for bringing this very important issue before the House . 
I expect all hon. members are interested in better protection for the wages and pensions of Canadian workers . 
Employees play a vital role in growing and sustaining a company 's operations . 
They put their hearts and souls , often during the best years of their lives , into making the business viable . 
Through their faith in their employers , workers often invest significant portions of their paycheques into company pension plans . 
I believe that all sides of the House can agree that it is unacceptable for a company to shirk its moral obligation by neglecting to pay employee wages and pension benefits . 
I have had the misfortune of being on the losing end of deals before and I can assure the House that it is no fun . 
As parliamentarians , if we are in a position to protect workers from suffering this hardship , then it is my opinion and the opinion of my esteemed colleagues in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada that we should make sure to take the steps necessary to offer Canadian workers that protection . 
This speaks to a sense of fairness that I believe can be found in virtually all Canadians , and that transcends party lines . 
All too often employees are left in a vulnerable position , both leading up to and during bankruptcy proceedings . 
Business owners often make the decisions that ultimately lead to bankruptcy . 
This fate is often as a result of circumstances beyond the control of the business owner , to be sure . 
However , as individuals charged with carrying out rather than directing company policy , many employees are not in a position where they can adequately assess the risks associated with their continued employment . 
When a business finally does declare bankruptcy , those same employees are equally at a disadvantage when it comes to assuming those risks through lost wages and pensions . 
In my home town a number of years ago a particular furniture company went into bankruptcy . 
Some of the people who stayed on , employees of 30 and 40 years , to see the receiver through the bankruptcy portion of that company were deprived of their pensions when they finished . 
Some of those who had quit or retired four and six months earlier received their pensions . 
It just seemed totally unfair to me . 
In this debate the House is being reminded that secured creditors are first in line to claim a company 's assets during bankruptcy proceedings . 
Next in line are the preferred creditors , a group that is further subdivided into categories of preferred creditors . 
Employees currently stand fourth in line as preferred creditors when it comes to claiming that which they are rightfully owed . 
Employees also face strict limitations when it comes to exactly how much they can claim . 
Current laws in Canada allow for the scenario where an employee has worked his or her entire life for a single company that then declares bankruptcy , leaving that employee with nothing . 
Now all of a sudden the employee has lost not only whatever wages remain outstanding , but also a lifetime worth of contributions to the company 's pension plan . 
Clearly , improvements in this area can and should be made . 
However , in making such improvements , we must be conscious of the unintended consequences of our actions . 
An unintended consequence of this very motion is that it may make it more difficult for start-up businesses and expanding businesses to obtain credit . 
We all know that entrepreneurs need capital in order to enter the market and grow their business . 
Most often this capital is obtained through a combination of equity and credit . 
In making the necessary loans , creditors assess the risks associated with the business owner 's ability to pay back the loan . 
If we were to change the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act by downgrading a secured creditor 's ability to recover the loan , creditors may react by further restricting the availability of loans by increasing the rate of interest that would apply . 
This could potentially lead to very serious and negative repercussions on our economy . 
Canadians rely on businesses to drive our economy and provide us with new jobs . 
Without available credit , businesses risk losing the opportunity to expand their operations and hire new employees . 
While it is clearly the intention of the motion to protect employees , it is quite possible that Motion No. 400 could actually have a profoundly negative impact on workers across Canada by indirectly limiting their opportunities to secure employment . 
The House would be well advised to consider this motion carefully . 
In seeking to help workers , we want to make sure we do not do more harm than good , a very real concern . 
The House had a similar debate in the spring of 2001 when the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre introduced a private member 's bill that would have amended the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act so that unpaid wages were ranked first in the order of distribution . 
In that debate , my colleague from Kings -- Hants , who at that time was our party 's industry critic , encouraged the House to consider the Australian model of employee protection during bankruptcies . 
I believe that suggestion is just as constructive and relevant today as it was then . 
In Australia , various levels of government work together to provide workers with coverage during bankruptcies in an employment insurance type system . 
Given the current size of the EI surplus in Canada , it might make sense for us to consider extending employment insurance coverage to include a portion of back wages owed to employees during a bankruptcy . 
There are clearly other options available to us that would enable us to move forward in guaranteeing better protection to Canadians . 
Progressive Conservatives recognize the need to better protect stakeholders during bankruptcies . 
As we move forward , we owe it to Canadians to carefully consider programs that are available in other jurisdictions . 
We must work to achieve a better balance between protecting access to capital in order to grow a stronger economy and protecting the ability of employees to secure wages and pension benefits that they have worked so hard to earn . 
Ms. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) : 
Madam Speaker , it is always a pleasure for me to try to find solutions to improve the situation of workers , and I congratulate my colleague from Churchill on her motion . 
For some years now , ever since they started to cut employment insurance , it has become increasingly inaccessible . 
We know that only four people out of ten are now eligible . 
Things are also getting difficult for workers whose employer goes bankrupt . 
When there is a bankruptcy -- and I know what I am talking about , because I worked in this field in the past -- the workers are lowest on the list of creditors who might benefit in some way from the proceeds of the sale of the company or its assets . 
Very often suppliers are first to be paid , and the employees are pushed aside . 
We also know that the two-week EI waiting period still in effect also penalizes these people . 
When workers lose their jobs suddenly because of a bankruptcy , they are penalized and at risk of losing a lot of money and having to give up possessions , .  Their well-being suffers greatly as well . 
It would therefore be very important for us to pass the motion of my colleague in order to stop employees from being penalized and to allow them to at least be the first to benefit from these two weeks , to be paid from the proceeds of the sale of the company or its assets . 
The first thing that should be done with those proceeds is to pay the employees their two weeks and then let them apply for EI . 
Workers are not in any way responsible for what happened to the company . 
Bankruptcies are often the result of bad administration , and workers in a plant do not necessarily have anything to do with administration . 
Very often they have no idea of how the company is run .  We must be clear and we must be honest . 
I believe this motion readjusts the situation in favour of the workers . 
If there is no money left after the company or anything else is sold , then let them at least give as much help as possible to each employee to get them through this period in no man 's land . 
They must be compensated as much as possible during those two weeks of the waiting period . 
Private members ' motions in support of workers do not seem to be very popular these days in this Canadian Parliament . 
I would like special attention to be paid to this one , as well as to all others relating to workers that will be coming before this House . 
We have been trying for a long time to make things better through parts I , II and III of the Canada Labour Code .  As my hon. colleague knows full well , we have often worked together to look for ways to improve the situation , on the basis of what is already in place in the provinces . 
Some provinces like Quebec are well ahead of their time . 
In Quebec , the legislation and opportunities are much more rewarding , as well as fair and equitable to workers . 
TheCanada Labour Code needs to be modernized . 
This would promote fairness for all workers . 
When people who have given 20 years of their lives to a company find themselves without work following a bankruptcy , this is not funny . 
When you are laid off temporarily while the company tries to get back on its feet , at least there is hope of being called back to work . 
But once the company has gone bankrupt , that is it . 
It is the end . 
This often means having to find work elsewhere , and getting special training . 
Those affected really do not need to be further penalized by not giving them their two weeks , which , when you think of it , should be mandatory . 
I think that turning to the EI program is not necessarily the answer either . 
It may not be the one that should pay the two weeks following a bankruptcy . 
Employers always get some money for the equipment or from the last contracts or what not . 
I think that an analysis could reveal some possibilities there . 
Bear in mind also that it is increasingly difficult to qualify for employment insurance . 
These people are doubly penalized , and unnecessarily so . 
We must ensure that they can regain their dignity and re-enter the labour market without losing what they had because their employers were unable to run their businesses properly . 
These are often not very well paid workers . 
Most of them are plant workers earning between $ 15,000 and $ 25,000 . 
And $ 25,000 a year is often considered good money in some plants . 
These are not people who can afford to put money aside in case the company goes bankrupt . 
It is just not possible . 
They have to live , they have children , it costs money . 
Often they do put money aside in a pension fund , but they do not want to use it before the time has come . 
However , sometimes they have to because they cannot get those two weeks , and quite often it hurts a lot . 
I strongly support the bill put forward by my colleague from Churchill . 
I hope she will find enough support in the House to allow for this modernization . 
The laws and the Canada Labour Code must be modernized . 
The legislation dealing with workers must be modernized . 
We must strive for fairness and also for a balance between employers and employees . 
Several years ago I introduced an anti-scab bill at the federal level that will soon come back to the House . 
We must restore some balance in employer-employee relations , so that negotiations are more peaceful and healthy . 
My colleague 's bill would help lessen employees ' stress . 
Should the company go bankrupt , they would no longer have to worry about what is going to happen to them . 
They would have some reassurance . 
I believe that if there is money , they should be the first ones to get it . 
That way , they would have enough money to survive until their employment insurance benefits kick in . 
One hopes they would have accumulated enough hours to be eligible . 
I will support this motion . 
I hope other members in this House will do the same . 
As we know , it would not cost the government anything . 
It would be the responsibility of the company using the money left after a bankruptcy , the proceeds from the sale of the company . 
When motions or bills in favour of workers come to the House , I would like to see my colleagues support them , so that workers in Quebec and Canada are dealt with fairly and appropriately . 
I will support the motion , therefore . 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
Madam Speaker , I am pleased to rise in the House today to support Motion No. 400 put forward by the member for Churchill . 
I want to thank the member for Churchill for her initiative because this really is an excellent motion .  It is very straightforward . 
It states : 
That .. the government should amend bankruptcy legislation to ensure that wages and pensions owed to employees are the first debts repaid when a bankruptcy occurs . 
I say , `` Hear , hear '' . 
It is about time . 
It is really quite astounding to actually look at the current legislation and see that everybody else lines up ahead of the people who actually put their labour into whatever company or business fails . 
First up is the government . 
The government is the first creditor to be paid , through CPP , income tax and employment insurance . 
Next on the list are the secured creditors , of course , which could include institutions such as the banks . 
Of course the banks will make money off bankruptcy , having carried loans secured by company assets . 
Third in the current legislation are the preferred creditors , who are placed on a prioritized list . 
Then , of course , the employees are at the end , at number four , behind the legal costs and the levy that goes to the Superintendent of Bankruptcy . 
This really has to be one of the most unfair provisions . 
Not only have people lost their jobs , they then get slapped in the face and really stuck with it when a bankruptcy occurs . 
They do not get anything in terms of wages they might be owed or , most importantly , their pensions . 
I think this motion for a change in the bankruptcy legislation is needed today more than ever before . 
We live in a world of globalized capital , of deregulation and , unfortunately , now a world of privatization . 
Not a day goes by on which we cannot open a major newspaper and see colossal failures of the bastions of capitalism , whether it is Enron , Air Canada or other major corporations going into a tailspin and going into failure . 
In this economic climate , where there is an emphasis on corporate concentration , where the bigger fish eat the smaller fish , where there are buyouts , bankruptcies and all the rest of it , I think we really have to look at the question of who the winners and losers are . 
And in every single case , the losers are the people who work for those businesses and those corporations . 
The Alliance may smirk at that , but it purports to represent those workers and yet it is those workers who are being absolutely skewered by the kind of legislation we have in Canada today , which sees them at the bottom of the line , not the top . 
I say hats off to the member for Churchill for identifying this as an issue that needs to be corrected and for having the initiative to bring it forward . 
It will be beyond me if members of the House cannot find it in themselves to support the motion and to say of course employees should be the people who get their wages and their pensions covered . 
We only have to look at what has taken place with Air Canada . 
When Air Canada filed for bankruptcy , I do not know about anybody else , but I got loads and loads of e-mail from people who were terrified that they were going to lose their pension in Air Canada because they knew what the legislation was and they knew they would be at the end of the line and out of luck . 
I even had children of Air Canada retirees writing to me because they were so terrified for their mothers or fathers who had worked for Air Canada for 25 or 30 years , who had paid into their pensions , and who had grown up in the company believing that their pensions were secure . 
They were terrified that suddenly , through the stroke of a pen and proceedings through the bankruptcy laws and so on , their parents would find that their pensions and sense of security were in jeopardy and were threatened as a result of Air Canada filing for bankruptcy . 
Surely that one example alone should serve to remind us that the law on bankruptcy as it currently exists is terribly discriminatory toward workers . 
It puts them at the end of the line . 
A couple of weeks ago in east Vancouver I met a constituent who had gone through the most incredible runaround in trying to collect $ 4,000 that he was owed by a small company that had gone into bankruptcy . 
He had gone through employment standards , which in B.C. under Gordon Campbell do not really exist any more ; there really is no protection for workers . 
This guy was a hardworking person .  He had helped his employer . 
He had been a diligent worker .  All he wanted was his $ 4,000 . 
He could not get any help from anyone . 
It was not available . 
What caused most of the distress for this constituent was not so much the $ 4,000 . 
I think he had kind of given up on that at some point . 
It was the fact that there was nothing there in a legal framework that could actually protect his interests as a worker . 
It demonstrated to me the need to have this motion that is before us today . 
I note that the Canadian Labour Congress has been advocating a package of measures that would ensure that workers ' interests are protected in the event of a bankruptcy or an insolvency . 
It advocated the idea of a federal wage protection fund . 
The member from the Bloc pointed out very eloquently that on every side workers are now completely skewered . 
Workers are not able to claim for EI , which is money that has actually been paid in . 
There is no government money in EI ; it comes from the employer and the employee . 
Not only can they not get EI but now there is no protection under the bankruptcy legislation . 
A federal wage protection fund that would provide employees with some measure of certainty of payment when they are faced with uncertainty in this world is a very good idea . 
There is the idea of pension insurance arrangements . 
The whole scandal around what is happening to pension funds is something that should be sounding off alarm bells in this place . 
Here again under the bankruptcy legislation the current situation would mean that someone who has paid into their pension does not have the most basic protection when it comes to bankruptcy . 
They do not even have protection for where those pension funds end up or who manages them . 
The administration of the Canada pension fund has been contracted out by the Liberal government , which is costing us billions of dollars . 
What a scam that is going on .  Yet it is employees who are on the receiving end . 
In conclusion , this is a very fine motion . 
It is so easy to shoot something down and to say it does not do this or it does not do that . 
The member has worked very hard to give responses to members who have raised questions or issues in the House and she will do so again today . 
The basic principle of this motion before us which is to say that workers should come first in terms of the wages and pensions they are owed when a bankruptcy occurs is the correct principle . 
It is where we should start from . 
If the motion needs fixing when it is implemented and legislation is changed , there is time enough to do that for sure . 
Let us vote affirmatively on the principle that is being advanced by the member for Churchill . 
I encourage all members of the House to support the motion for the very important principle that it advances . 
It is worthy of support . 
Mr. Larry Bagnell ( Yukon , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I am happy to rise on this motion today . 
I would first like to make a couple of comments on the previous commentary . 
In relation to the Canadian Labour Congress , it put forward an initiative in the last few weeks . 
I would like to commend several items in its initiative . 
One goal is to work toward parity between men and women in insurance benefits . 
That is an admirable goal and I look forward to seeing what can be done in that respect . 
I am also quite supportive of its work on behalf of older workers , because older workers have a harder time finding new employment . 
What our government has been promoting for a few years now is the whole concept of lifelong learning and that people need training not only to get back into the employment field but while they are at work to continue in the employment field . 
I also want to add my support for the Air Canada workers and their pensions . 
When we discussed this at the transport committee meeting , I strongly put forward the position , as did the whole transport committee , that this was something we definitely had to look at and make sure that those pensions were not in jeopardy . 
They are handled separately from the rest of the bankruptcy . 
Unfortunately a lot of pensions , including Air Canada 's pension , had a lot of reduction because of the investments of the pension plan . 
The point was , for the part that did not cause the decrease in moneys , the secretariat that looked after pensions had to make sure that Air Canada 's payments in that pension plan were up to date so that people will continue to get their pensions . 
I congratulate the mover for bringing forward this important topic . 
I also congratulate her for her recent courage in other major developments in her constituency . 
Everyone is in agreement with the goal and with the principle . 
Pensions are so important to people . 
People work hard all their lives . 
They certainly depend upon their pensions and we certainly would not want anything to get in their way . 
I am sure everyone agrees with that and it is just the mechanisms on how best to do it that we are discussing in this debate , as well as other debates . 
Parliamentarians have always recognized that pensions are so important . 
That is why they have put in special mechanisms to protect them so that pensions are not at the bottom of the list but in a separate part where they are protected . 
I welcome the opportunity to participate in today 's debate on Motion No. 400 which proposes to amend the current bankruptcy legislation to ensure that wages and pensions owed to employees are the first debts repaid when a bankruptcy occurs . 
I would also like to note that my remarks today especially address the pension issues that were raised during a debate that took place on Motion No. 400 in June . 
I would first like to put this issue into context beginning with a general overview of the existing pension plan system in Canada . 
The purpose of pension plans in our country is to provide retirement benefits for plan beneficiaries . 
As hon. members know , our system includes both public pension plans and private pension plans . 
Public pension plans include the Canada pension plan , the Quebec pension plan and old age security . 
Private pension plans consist of occupational pension plans , otherwise known as registered pension plans or RPPs . 
They cover both defined benefit and defined contribution plans which are provided as part of an employment contract . 
I also want to mention that private pension plans are voluntary but must be registered either federally or provincially . 
In addition , the federal and provincial governments provide tax assistance for savings in RPPs and retirement savings plans , or RRSPs , to encourage and assist income replacement in retirement . 
As I indicated , today 's motion proposes to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to ensure that wages and pension moneys owed to employees would be the first debts paid when a bankruptcy occurs . 
We discussed the issue of protecting wages here in the House on June 5 , 2003 . 
Today my remarks will focus on the issue of securing pension benefits in bankruptcy proceedings . 
The main federal statute that regulates private pension plans of companies that fall under federal jurisdiction , such as banking , interprovincial transportation and telecommunications , is the Pension Benefits Standards Act , 1985 , or the PBSA as it is commonly called . 
While some 1,200 pension plans fall under the purview of this act , close to 90 % of all registered plans in Canada are provincially registered . 
The PBSA sets out the rules for administration and funding of federally regulated private pension plans . 
It imposes minimum funding requirements on pension plans to support the solvency and security of the pension fund and its ability to pay out promised benefits . 
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions , otherwise known as OSFI , administers the PBSA . 
OSFI 's role is to protect the rights and interests of plan beneficiaries , having due regard to the fact that administrators of pension plans are responsible for the management of the plans and that pension plans can experience financial and funding difficulties that can result in the reduction of those benefits . 
OSFI has a variety of means at its disposal to protect the rights and interests of plan beneficiaries of federal pension plans . 
Intervention activities can range from meeting with the plan administrator , to asking that a special actuarial report be conducted , to , in extreme cases , replacing the plan administrator with one appointed by OSFI . 
In the current environment , OSFI 's priority is to identify risks faced by federally regulated pension plans , promote sound management of those risks , and see that corrective actions are taken where appropriate . 
The regulatory framework provided by the PBSA , supported by the supervision of OSFI , provides an appropriate framework for protecting the interests of pension plan members , even my comrades in the Alliance . 
Federal statutes such as the Income Tax Act also impact on private pension plans . 
It should be noted that most private pension plans are governed by provincial pension legislation . 
As hon. members may know , the PBSA provides protection for pension plan members by requiring the employer to keep the pension fund separate and apart from its own and by deeming the pension funds to be held in trust . 
In addition , any amounts owed to the pension fund are subject to a deemed trust . 
This deemed trust provision protects members of a federally registered pension plan from a scenario where the employer is in financial difficulty and may have to resort to the Companies ' Creditors Arrangement Act , the CCAA , or Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act , the BIA . 
In the event of bankruptcy , moneys owed under the deemed trust provision of a federally registered pension plan would be given priority status . 
I would like to remind the House that the Senate Standing Committee on Banking , Trade and Commerce has been reviewing the issue of bankruptcy protection . 
It is giving the matter full consideration in its review of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Companies ' Creditors Arrangement Act . 
To assist the committee , Industry Canada prepared a report describing the wage and pension protection issue , proposing possible solutions and setting out the views expressed by stakeholders about the options proposed . 
I agree that ensuring the promised benefits of pension plan members and beneficiaries is a key priority . 
That is why I have outlined several measures in our current system that ensure that this goal is met . 
Let me outline some additional measures that are currently in place . 
As I noted previously , the Pension Benefits Standards Act , 1985 requires that amounts of a pension plan be held in trust or otherwise kept separate and apart from the assets of the employer . 
In addition , the pension plan administrators must reference all factors that may affect the funding , solvency and ability of the plan to meet its financial obligations . 
These rules are already on the books . 
It is clear that the current status already largely meets the admirable intent of the motion . 
The government believes that the Pension Benefit Standards Act , 1985 and accompanying regulations have established the right climate to ensure that pension plan administrators are responsive to the concerns and objectives of plan members and employers . 
Most certainly , ensuring sound , secure pension systems remains a priority for the government . 
Recent reforms to the Canada pension plan , together with recent PBSA amendments and regulations , demonstrate this commitment . 
I can assure hon. members that the government will continue to make changes to the Pension Benefits Standards Act , 1985 when and if required . 
Given the built-in checks and balances and the existing duties and responsibilities of pension plan administrators under the PBSA , today 's proposal to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act does not appear warranted . 
However , I am always looking for mechanisms that will ensure that employees receive the hard-earned benefits that are so important to them in their retirement certainly before less important payouts . 
I look forward to such other amendments or proposals in the future . 
Mrs. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) : 
Madam Speaker , I thank all my colleagues who have taken the time to speak on this motion . 
I recognize that everyone has wonderful accolades for workers and feels that they should be looked after , but somehow they are not willing to take that extra step and actually put them first , in front of banks , in front of the government and in front of other creditors . 
Somehow in this country workers are still at the bottom and , quite frankly , still underground a lot of the time , a lot of them dead because of their toil . 
Somehow most of the members in the House are still putting them at the bottom . 
I will tell the House that very few company executives or people in business offices end up dying from their work , unlike the workers who are most gravely affected by this type of legislation . 
The government representative who spoke on the motion tonight , much like the one who spoke on my motion yesterday , used the argument that `` if something 's not broken , don't fix it '' . 
But the reality is that the system is broken . 
We do not have a good pension plan and safety net in place . 
That is extremely apparent to anyone who has seen the media over the last two years or has read about the risks to pension funds . 
Everyone knows there is a problem and we need to fix it . 
What we are asking is to put workers first . 
I know that the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions is supposed to ensure that enough money is in the pension fund deposit to ensure that it can be paid out . 
But the reality is that only a percentage of the amount has to be there and , in a good many cases , just like the Air Canada case , the pension fund has been shorted . 
In my view , this is legalized theft . 
Employees paid into that fund . 
Their employers paid into that fund as well . 
That was their agreement : `` I will work for you if you do this for me '' . 
In essence , what has happened is legalized theft . 
Money that belonged to employees was used for something else . 
We are saying that this needs to be corrected . 
That is what I am asking for . 
There is a problem . 
Anyone who does not think there is a problem has had their head in the sand for the last two or three years . 
I brought this motion to the floor of the House of Commons as a result of workers in my riding who right now are working for companies that have not gone bankrupt but who know that their pension fund is short . 
They know it is short a fair bit . 
When it should be at about 70 % or 80 % , it is at about 20 % less . 
Employees have been trying to make sure that money gets put into the fund . 
If their companies go bankrupt today , they are at the bottom of the pit thanks to everyone in this House who does not make an effort to change this legislation and put workers first . 
It is bad enough that employees do not get their wages if there is no money , but they will also not get their pensions , which were supposed to keep them secure in their later years for retirement . 
My colleague from Perth -- Middlesex commented that he has experienced this and that it could have ramifications on both employers and banks . 
In most cases , banks make up a good amount of the money on the interest anyway and they are in a far better position to be able to survive after a bankruptcy than employees in the workplace . 
There are others who suffer as result of this problem . 
Whole communities suffer . 
If a business goes bankrupt in a small community and the pension funds and wages are not there , every business in that community suffers . 
By ensuring that this legislation is in place we are actually stabilizing some of those communities in a good many instances , as far as I am concerned . 
Most important , we are telling workers in this country that they count , that they are first , that they are number one . 
We are telling them that we know they have worked and they should be taken into account . 
This is the House of Commons . 
This is not the house of employers . 
This is not the house for the corporate elite . 
This is the house of commoners . 
I know that some people in here get a little high on the hog sometimes and see themselves as a bit better than the carpenter or the miner or the truck driver , but the bottom line is that we are supposed to be representing those people , all those airline workers who are going to lose their pensions . 
We are supposed to be here representing them , and it is time we did . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
Is the House ready for the question ?

Adjournment Proceedings 
A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved . 
Firearms Registry 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton -- Melville , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Madam Speaker , on May 8 , 2003 , I asked the Prime Minister if he regretted saying that some of the bureaucrats in charge of the billion dollar sinkhole known as the gun registry had been demoted and fired when it is now known that the statement is not true . 
In fact , no one was fired and no one was demoted . 
In fact , some of the bureaucrats in charge of this mess were promoted and many of them got bonuses . 
The Prime Minister did not answer the question and neither did the fourth minister in charge of this mess . 
His predecessors said repeatedly that they were fully accountable and responsible for the gun registry screws-ups , but to date no one has been held the least bit accountable and responsible . 
What good are words if they are not followed up by actions ? 
Why has no one paid for this billion dollar mistake ? 
When will someone , anyone , be held fully accountable and responsible for this billion dollar mistake ? 
It has been 10 months since the Auditor General blew the whistle on the biggest error in accounting estimates ever made in the history of this country , and Parliament is still being kept in the dark . 
In the last 10 months , the government has repeatedly failed to answer our questions : How much will it cost to fully implement the gun registry and how much will it cost to maintain ? 
In my supplementary question , I asked the Solicitor General why his billion dollar gun registry fails to track the addresses of 131,000 convicted criminals who have been prohibited from owning firearms . 
These 131,000 most dangerous individuals get to roam Canada free while two million licensed gun owners have to report their change of address within 30 days or they could go to jail for up to two years . 
Where is the logic in that ? 
Last weekend the Toronto Star reported how absurd the Liberal logic is . 
The Star reported that Daniel Greig , who was on parole and prohibited from owning guns , illegally acquired the following weapons : a six shot .44 calibre Smith &amp ; Wesson ; a .45 calibre Glock semi-automatic ; a .45 calibre Heckler and Koch semi-automatic ; a 12 gauge Franchi pump action shotgun with a pistol grip ; an M-16 , a .223 calibre Colt semi-automatic assault rifle ; and several rounds of ammunition . 
The Star reported , `` Why the police are sad : Greig was able to buy all these guns .. with no trouble at all '' . 
Why would the Solicitor General insist on keeping a billion dollar gun registry whose only purpose is to monitor the activities of millions of law-abiding citizens and not monitor at all the activities and whereabouts of 131,000 dangerous criminals like Daniel Greig ? 
Why does the Privacy Act protect the privacy rights of 131,000 convicted criminals but not the privacy rights of millions of law-abiding gun owners ? 
Last May 8 , the Solicitor General failed to answer this question about the highly questionable target for the failed Firearms Act . 
Instead , he chose to obscure this fact with more bogus numbers . 
He told the House that the gun registry had assisted in 325 actual police investigations . 
However , an Access to Information Act request revealed that the minister 's department was unable to produce the documents to back up his claim . 
My questions : Why do MPs have to file Access to Information Act requests , why is most of the information blacked out when we get it , and why is Parliament still being kept in the dark ? 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General of Canada , Lib. ) : 
Madam Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for Yorkton -- Melville for the opportunity to rise in this House and to speak about some of the important changes that are taking place to streamline the firearms program and make it more efficient . 
As the hon. member is aware , over the past several months the government announced several key initiatives to improve the program and provide better services to Canadians across the country . 
On February 21 the Minister of Justice , joined by the Solicitor General , tabled an action plan to deliver a firearms control program that provides significant public safety benefits while setting the program on a path to lower costs . 
The action plan responds to the Auditor General 's recommendations contained in her report of last December . 
In fact , the government has already begun to implement these actions which are based on the recommendations of the Auditor General . 
On April 14 the Canada Firearms Centre was transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of the Solicitor General . 
I think everyone , the key players and partners , agrees that this is a natural fit for the Solicitor General portfolio , as enhancing public safety is one of its main focuses . 
The action plan states the government 's intention to consolidate the headquarters function for the firearms program in Ottawa . 
This has already occurred . 
In addition , on May 30 , a firearms commissioner was appointed . 
Reporting to the Solicitor General , the commissioner has full authority and accountability for all federally administered elements of the Canadian firearms program . 
Moreover , according to the action plan , the position of financial controller has been filled . 
This individual is responsible for risk analysis and for data and report integrity . 
And he must ensure that resources are used in accordance with the program 's financial plan . 
The controller must also report the results . 
On May 14 Bill C-10A received royal assent . 
The amendments to the Criminal Code and the Firearms Act are administrative in nature and their goal is to streamline the Canada firearms program . 
Several of these amendments require regulations or amendments to existing regulations before they can take effect . 
Accordingly , on June 13 , 15 proposed regulations were tabled in Parliament by the Solicitor General . 
All but one of those amend existing regulations . 
The tabling of those proposed regulations is another important step in the continuous improvement of the firearms program . 
There is also , first , public consultation through the official gazette on regulations and , second , consultation with Parliament . 
Canadians are invited to share their ideas and their comments on the Canadian firearms program and on the proposed regulations on the Web site of the Canada Firearms Center . 
The simple facts that I have given , and that is not the whole story obviously , show that the government has put into practice or is putting into practice the recommendations of the Auditor General . 
The government is consulting Canadians and its goal is to ensure that this program is efficient and practical . 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz : 
Madam Speaker , in the reply just given to my question the member has emphasized that the Auditor General 's recommendations are being taken into account . 
That is not true at all . 
The Auditor General said that the full costs of the program had been hidden from Parliament . 
My question specifically asked , what are the total costs and what will it cost to maintain this program ? 
That answer was not forthcoming and that was the key thing that the Auditor General said should be revealed to Parliament . 
What are the total costs ? 
We have been waiting for almost 10 months and that has not happened yet . 
The second part of my question was not even addressed . 
Why is the criminal not targeted rather than the law-abiding citizen ? 
It is absolutely clear that this is simply a bureaucratic paper-pushing exercise that is not gun control .  It is government out of control . 
It is government spending a billion dollars , probably much more than that , on something that will not improve public safety . 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings : 
Madam Speaker , the Canadian Alliance , true to its colours , wildly exaggerates . 
Canadians support the firearms program and gun control . 
The government is committed to ensuring that we have proper gun control and to make it more efficient . 
The government is also committed to implementing all the recommendations of the Auditor General . 
The member talks about how not all the costs have been revealed . 
He knows very well that in committee today that same question that he is asking now was asked of the Solicitor General by one of his colleagues . 
It was made very clear by the director general of the Canada Firearms Centre that some of those costs will be revealed by the Department of Justice when it tables its report . 
Some of the costs can only be revealed and determined accurately when the Canada Firearms Centre , which became an agency this year , is able to -- 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Bakopanos ) : 
Order , please . 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted .  Accordingly , the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24(1) .

Food and Drugs Act 
The House resumed from April 9 , 2003 , consideration of the motion that Bill C-420 , an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act be now read the second time and referred to a committee . 
Ms. Diane Bourgeois ( Terrebonne -- Blainville , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this morning we are beginning the last hour of debate at second reading of Bill C-420 , an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act , put forward by our hon. colleague from the Canadian Alliance . 
Let us remember that in 1997 the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health was given a mandate to study all aspects of the issue of legislating natural health products . 
The committee was charged with holding consultations , making analyses and formulating recommendations concerning the legislative and regulatory regime governing traditional medicines , homeopathic preparations , and vitamin and mineral supplements . 
The committee was also expected to consult broadly with stakeholders , including associations , individuals representing consumers , manufacturers , distributors , growers , importers , exporters and retailers . 
We see that this bill , like the committee 's mandate , has reached a great many individuals who were very concerned about the regulation of natural health products . 
The committee held many hearings , heard many witnesses , and came to the realization that regulation of natural products was very controversial . 
Many of the witnesses lobbied to have the regulations governing natural health products changed . 
Consequently , the committee members said that it was more than time to review the entire issue , which they did . 
The same year , a Health Canada survey showed that 56 % of Canadians had used natural health products in the previous six months . 
Thus we can see that Canadians and Quebeckers are taking more responsibility for their own health and in many cases , this leads to increased interest in and demand for natural health products . 
The committee concluded -- it set out parameters -- that natural health products have their own unique characteristics and must not be treated strictly as either food or pharmaceutical products . 
Moreover , the committee said that natural health product regulations must not unduly restrict access by consumers . 
In addition , it concluded that the authority for decision-making must be given to a regulatory body that has dedicated expertise and experience with natural health products and that natural health product regulatoryapproaches must respect diverse cultural traditions . 
These four principles listed by the committee led to the request for the creation of another committee , which could draft legislation on the matter . 
The bill before us today does not in any way reflect the safeguards or points of reference the committee set out . 
The Standing Committee on Health would have liked the current act to be changed because , as it now stands , a natural product can be considered a food or a drug . 
The Standing Committee on Health , which received the mandate to study the act , said that natural foods should come under a third category . 
They have their peculiarities and particularities and , thus , an act respecting food and drugs should not include them . 
Unfortunately , the bill before us does not correspond with what the Standing Committee on Health had decided . 
What we are saying is that a third category absolutely must be created for products that should truly be identified by skilled people . 
Currently , everyone -- whether at Health Canada or in the general public -- claims to know the benefits or inconveniences of natural health foods . 
Unfortunately , far too often , people do not know what impact these might have . 
In 1997 or 1998 , the Standing Committee on Health had said it would be better if the legislation required us to form a committee with specialists . 
Thus , a third category must be created for natural health products . 
This is one of the conclusions of the report of the Standing Committee on Health .  Again , to the committee , natural products are neither food nor drugs . 
The report stated that regulations alone are not sufficient and that statutory amendments should be made as soon as possible . 
The report also indicated that the majority of witnesses who appeared before the committee had reached this same conclusion . 
As a result , the Bloc Quebecois had asked for a certain flexibility , which does not exist under the present legislation . 
The Bloc Quebecois , which represents Quebec in the House of Commons , conducted a study and concluded that there are many manufacturers of natural products and many consumers of such products in Quebec . 
This industry generates over 3,000 jobs in Quebec . 
So , if a certain level of flexibility is not allowed and if care is not taken , numerous jobs could be lost . 
In Quebec too , naturopaths have said that this would mean that some products that do not pass the approval regime applicable to drugs could be kept off the shelves . 
What is happening at present ? 
Since natural food products have not been defined , they are sometimes classified as drugs and sometimes as food . 
Our natural products that fit in neither category are quite simply excluded . 
This is unacceptable . 
Yes , statutory amendments are needed . 
A new category must be created , because natural health products are not food . 
We need a bill that will create a third category of products . 
Natural health products should not be subject to the approval regime for drugs , which would mean their withdrawal because they do not correspond to the overall definition of a drug . 
The bill currently before the House is therefore vague . 
The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill because the experts , the committee and the public were ignored . 
In its present form , the bill must simply be defeated . 
That is what the Bloc Quebecois is going to do , since it opposes this bill . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton -- Strathcona , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to speak to Bill C-420 , an act to amend the definitions of the Food and Drugs Act , brought forward by my colleague for Nanaimo -- Alberni . 
The bill addresses an issue that is very important to many of my constituents in Edmonton -- Strathcona and indeed many Canadians . 
If passed , Bill C-420 will categorize natural health products as food , as opposed to drugs . 
It is important to thank my colleague , the member for Nanaimo -- Alberni , for his hard work in preparing the bill . 
When I was first elected in 1997 , I promised to make natural health products a major issue , and this bill addresses the concerns that so many Canadians have with the potential tightening of regulations when it comes to natural health products . 
The issue has been important to my party even before the release of the standing committee 's final report on health in 1998 . 
After months of review , the committee chose to recommend the continuation of a paternal federal government attitude protecting Canadians from the unknown evils of natural health products . 
This unfortunate big brother approach to regulating natural health products , products that the committee 's own research determined were safe and which uses were , `` well known and pose minimal or no risk of harm '' , assumes that Canadians cannot be trusted to do their homework and educate themselves before taking natural health products . 
Recently the government recommended creating a third category of natural health products to address questions of how these items should be classified . 
Manufacturers , distributors and average Canadians using the products have concerns that this increased regulation will limit their freedom of choice and product selection and will cause the costs of these treatments to skyrocket beyond what is affordable . 
Canadians deserve greater freedom in their choice of complimentary treatments and natural health products . 
The government has long talked the talk of promoting and emphasizing wellness and prevention . 
However , it would seem , that when the time comes to walk the walk and make real , tangible and positive change by allowing greater access to safe , natural preventative health treatments , it is too busy devising new ways to tax the Canadian consumer . 
It was the health committee 's mandate to `` consider the objectives of providing consumers freedom of choice and access to natural health products '' while ensuring the quality and safety of such products . 
There can be no question that public safety must always be the first priority when considering any legislation , particularly as it pertains to a food or drug item . 
However the heavy regulation of these products is inconsistent with the experiences of Canadians , which have demonstrated overwhelmingly an incredibly safe historical pattern of use regarding natural health products . 
The health committee 's final report noted that both mortality and morbidity rates associated with natural health products use were negligible in comparison with pharmaceuticals . 
In fact improper use of prescription drugs by trained professionals is one of the largest causes of death in the United States . 
The bottom line is that the majority of natural health products are safe if used correctly ; that is when used for the appropriate indications and in correct doses . 
The report also emphasized that it is not practical , necessary or economically feasible to conduct toxicological studies to establish the safety of most natural health products . 
Pharmaceutical testing can cost upwards of $ 300,000 per product . 
It is clear that testing the 6,000 natural health products currently on the market is simply not realistic . 
In fact this type of testing is not even particularly desirable given the unavoidable approval costs that will be passed along to the average consumer . 
These costs will punish Canadian consumers for using safe products that prevent them from having to go to their general practitioners to get a prescription . 
Indeed , unnecessary regulation of these products will only further tax the already strained health care system by causing natural health products users , incapable of paying the inflated prices for these safe and conventional inexpensive products , to give up on accessible forms of preventative medicine . 
Canadians almost universally recognize natural health products as foods , certainly not as drugs , especially when consumed in the dosage and form recommended . 
The bottom line is that existing emphasis on government control , licensing and regulation of mostly benign consumer products could be greatly simplified . 
Through bill C-420 , we now have the opportunity to accomplish this end . 
My party has recommended an organization structure for regulating natural health products . 
By regulating these products under the purview of Health Canada 's food directorate , I believe we could ensure that these substances are viewed by the professionals with the training and experience best equipped to manage their safe distribution . 
The government has taken steps to see that existing enforcement personnel receive adequate natural health product training , and I feel this effort is respectable . 
Unfortunately however , the committee 's final report made recommendations for the allocations of these increased resources of natural health products management under the drug directorate . 
These enforcement officers regulate these harmless products under the same discerning criteria as they do with strong and often dangerous prescription drugs . 
This attitude is consistent with the paternal theme in the final report that refuses to give average Canadians any credit in their own decision making abilities when it comes to natural supplements . 
It comes down to this .  Canadians should have their choices . 
This has been the constant theme of my colleague and our party on this side of the House . 
Insisting on the further restriction of natural health products simply contradicts every principle Canadian natural health product users have articulated . 
Like most Canadians , the Canadian Alliance believes there are already too many enforcement personnel barging into health food stores with RCMP escort , seizing computers and raiding store shelves for packets of harmless melatonin or stevia , an herb traditionally used as a natural sweetener . 
Surely the Government of Canada has more important things on which to spend taxpayer money . 
Yet under cost recovery for the new natural health products , the government will insist on extracting more taxpayer money . 
Natural health products consumers will end up paying more for their products . 
In the past positive steps have been taken to address the needs and safety of Canadians who use natural health products through the creation of an NHP advisory panel to allow input from experts who are professionally involved with natural health products . 
Formal recognition of the need for improved labelling of products was made in 1998 and our party supported that initiative . 
With the input of the Standing Committee on Health , there was the creation of an open and accountable appeals process , and finally the greater training of inspectors and enforcement officers on natural health products , which I mentioned earlier . 
At the end of the day however , the government has followed its longstanding tradition of ruling on the side of a paternalistic and overarching system of controls and regulations which limit the ability of Canadians to access and make use of natural herbal supplements which have been proven to be harmless . 
There is no justification for this type of increased regulation of these products . 
The bottom line is Canadians correctly assume that natural health products are safe and effective . 
They believe that decades of safe use should be the primary consideration when determining freedom of access . 
These Canadians are concerned that the government 's new rules and regulations will unnecessarily restrict the access to medications and treatments they have safely used for many years . 
Ultimately their concerns are justified . 
We hope the government will listen , because ultimately , as I have mentioned throughout the theme of my speech , natural health products are a preventive and exciting form of health care , especially because so many Canadians have increasingly been using these products . 
It would be a shame to encourage going down the road where we would be banning certain products in the future arbitrarily , which would open up a whole new black market , an area which I did not address , of importing in other ways these sorts of products into the country . 
Canadians who want these products will get them one way or another . 
Let us ensure that we have an open approach to this process so it can work for Canadians , one that is cost effective and , as was mentioned by my colleague from Nanaimo -- Alberni , ensures these products do not get classified under the drug category . 
Mr. John Bryden ( Ancaster -- Dundas -- Flamborough -- Aldershot , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have to thank the member for Nanaimo -- Alberni for bringing forward Bill C-420 and solving a television commercial mystery for me that I have wondered about for a very long time . 
The House will be familiar with the commercial which appears in several forms showing a man coming out of a house one morning , leaping and jumping about , holding hands , jumping over mailboxes and showing great excitement and joie de vivre . 
We all know , when we see that commercial , that the man has taken a drug that has cured him , at least temporarily , of sexual impotence . 
He had a nice night before and that is why he is so joyously happy . 
I have always wondered why the people who put that commercial together did not just simply say that this was an advertisement for a drug for sexual impotence . 
However it turns out there was a very good reason why not . 
Schedule A in the Food and Drugs Act lists a number of maladies for which it is forbidden to advertise a cure for in the way of any kind of drug or any other prophylactic . 
Among those various maladies is sexual impotence . 
Obviously the people marketing this drug are unable to actually name the purpose of the drug . 
Bill C-420 addresses this whole question of the list of maladies in schedule A for which it is forbidden to advertise a cure or a remedy . 
The bill proposed by the member for Nanaimo -- Alberni would eliminate the schedule altogether . 
I have to say that the member has struck a real chord here . 
This list was compiled in 1934 , before antibiotics were discovered , Mr. Speaker . 
On that list we can find things like arthritis , asthma , diabetes , depression , gangrene , glaucoma , gout , and it goes on and on . 
We know there are a number of drugs on the market that address these particular sicknesses . 
It seems completely unreasonable that the list as it exits makes it impossible to advertise these drugs and their purposes relating to these particular forms of sickness should exist . 
That having been said , I still have reservations about simply eliminating schedule A because there is the danger that people without good conscience , shall we say , might try to market cures , remedies and drugs , both prescription and especially non-prescription drugs , which might make claims that are unwarranted . 
The bottom line is that schedule A should be scrapped . 
The member is perfectly right on that point . 
I realize the Minister of Health has indicated a willingness to overhaul schedule A , but I can see it is completely out of date and should be gone . 
The other aspect of Bill C-420 is the member also wants to redefine the word food to include natural health products . 
I have a lot of problems with that because one thing food is , is food by definition is a natural health product . 
We all take food because it is good for us . 
We have this difficulty . 
If we add natural health products to the definition of food , basically we are defining a word by words that mean essentially the same thing . 
The difficulty is a semantic difficulty , but a very important difficulty if we actually take this into law . 
Natural health products are thought by many not in terms of simply being good for us , but are actually thought in terms of having some curative properties or some properties that might address certain symptoms that one might possess . 
In the field of natural remedies , the usage of the words `` natural health product '' is in this context of something having curative properties that might address a person 's symptoms of some kind of malady . 
But in the strict sense , natural health product simply could mean , and the courts would of course argue this , any kind of food that we might want to take . 
So eating a tomato or a potato could have curative properties , and I do not think that this is the intention the member for Nanaimo -- Alberni has when he wants to add natural health product to the list of foods . 
I would suggest that what the member really wants to do and what he should be seeking to do is to add a new definition in the list of definitions in the Food and Drugs Act and have a middle category between drug and food , and that middle category would be medicine . 
Because what we are really talking about when we move into the field of natural health products and their effect on a person 's physical well-being is that we see them as things that can be taken as medicine , and a medicine is not necessarily a drug . 
A medicine is not necessarily a pharmaceutical . 
I have to tell the member opposite that I have great sympathy with where he is going on this , because I am not one who believes that pharmaceutical drugs are the answer to everything . 
I think one of the big problems , and I think one of the reasons that is driving the member , is that pharmaceutical drugs take a lot of clinical trials , so it takes a long time to get a drug on the marketplace . 
If a natural health product has to go through clinical trials , then it is delayed in reaching the market . 
I point out to the House that a clinical trial is simply a collection of empirical information . 
Clinical trials are no better than the number of tests that are taken on a particular drug . 
As it happens , some natural health products are empirically tested over centuries . 
For an example , I refer to tea . 
Everyone drinks tea and we know that it has no deleterious side effects . 
Tea was originally a natural health product that was seen as a stimulant . 
That is how tea was brought into England in the 18th century when the tea trade developed . 
We now know that tea does have a stimulating effect and we know now from these very long trials that it has no side effects . 
The difficulty with pharmaceuticals is that the public has been led to believe that simply because pharmaceuticals go through a clinical trial of several thousand tests , let us say , that there are no side effects . 
However , there can be very serious side effects of pharmaceuticals that pass into the open market . 
I think we really do need to look in the area that is directed by the member for Nanaimo -- Alberni , because I think there is a third category and that third category is medicine , where we do know from long experience there are no side effects to that medicine about which we should be concerned and we know from long experience that it appears to have a positive benefit to the people taking it . 
There is a middle ground there , which I think we should consider very seriously . 
So I am somewhat divided on the bill ; I would think that if the bill passed the House and went to the health committee that the committee could strike down schedule A and there would be no impact . 
As a matter of fact , it might galvanize Health Canada into coming up with a new schedule , which I do not think is possible , actually ; I think schedule A just has to disappear because that is the end of it . 
As for the question of actually changing the definition of food to include natural health products , I do not think that works . 
But I think the member has done the House a service in giving us an opportunity to assess the relative values of natural health products and pharmaceuticals . 
Perhaps there is a middle road , as was mentioned by the previous Bloc speaker , and that middle road is the defining of something called medicine . 
Mr. Loyola Hearn ( St. John 's West , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to say a few words in support of the bill put forth by my colleague from Nanaimo -- Alberni . 
This bill deals with a concern that a lot of people across the country are expressing . 
More and more people are becoming conscious about their health and more and more people are looking to natural health remedies . 
In fact , this is not a new phenomenon . 
The people who originally settled this country used such products very successfully , and especially the aboriginal groups used them , not only then , but even yet they continue to use such products very successfully . 
In fact , the basis for many of the drugs and whatever vitamins and supplements we use today is from sources identified and practices used by these groups . 
This is certainly not new . 
What is happening , of course , that is governments , as governments do , try to get overly protective and try to make sure that everything is regimented , everything is labelled , and everything is listed on the label , which costs manufacturers fortunes but which also eliminates many products that would assist the average person if perhaps they were looked upon as food rather than being thrown into the drug category . 
If my colleague from Bonavista -- Trinity -- Conception were to speak on this bill , he would undoubtedly talk about a product put forth in Newfoundland and Labrador : the seal oil capsule . 
It is becoming extremely popular not only in our province but throughout the country and internationally . 
One of the concerns people have about it is that the labelling will prevent it from being exported to countries which are really very interested in obtaining this product . 
They think that the government will probably consider it more a drug than an actual food product . 
If it were a food product , there would be absolutely no problem whatsoever in exporting it to countries such as Taiwan , where there is a great interest and a demand for the product mainly because of the benefits of taking such a supplement . 
Seal oil capsules are apparently even more potent than the old cod-liver oil capsule , which many people took for years because of its vitamin D supplement that was included . 
Sometimes a little bit of common sense and rationality go a long way . 
Bureaucrats , perhaps more so than governments , get caught up in the fact that everything has to be labelled and identified with the pros and the cons . 
For 90 % of what we eat and use throughout the world we have no idea of what is involved , but in certain areas where we have some control and jurisdiction everyone wants to have a say and all we are doing is complicating the whole situation . 
Perhaps we should be a little more lenient and less black and white on issues . 
The act as presently constituted protects against the use of products which would be poisonous or harmful to us . 
The act prevents anyone exaggerating any benefits from the product being considered , used or developed . 
There is already a protection for people who would have such concerns . 
What is needed , as I have said , is some common sense and the opportunity for people to use products which they know themselves are good and are not harmful , but are beneficial to them for whatever reason . 
We are tightening the screws on these regulations ; we are closing doors . 
That is not what we should be doing . 
We should be opening the doors , as long as we are protecting Canadians from products that would be harmful . 
We support the initiative . 
I congratulate my colleague for bringing it forth . 
There may be some refinements needed , such as some of the suggestions just mentioned by the member opposite . 
There may be better ways of doing it , but that is why we bring ideas forth to the House ; as the issues are debated in the House and as they go through committee , we can make the proper refinements and placements . 
But instead of trying to come up with legislation that is going to tie the hands of our people and create more red tape and bureaucracy , let us try to cut out the red tape and bureaucracy and come up with some common sense solutions which would help the people of the country rather than put a millstone around their necks . 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to talk on Bill C-420 for a moment and explain my involvement on the issue . 
I should have a disclaimer , and the disclaimer is as follows : I am not a user of natural health products . 
I have never , ever taken any of these natural health products , so I would like to say that I am a little bit like the Auditor General in that I am independent of the industry and of those individuals who manufacture and produce these products . 
I am also , as a medical doctor , a guy who has had the choice or opportunity of listening to my patients talk about the use of these products . 
I formed an opinion , consequently , about the use of these products because of my association as a practising GP. I found that a lot of my patients were using these products and had good success with them . 
In fact , they were somewhat reticent to tell me until they found that I was not negative about their use . 
When I queried them , I would often ask them if they were taking any prescription drugs and also if they were taking anything natural . 
Many of them told me that they were taking the products to boost their immune systems . 
They felt better and they thought that it prevented them from coming to see me ; there was no negative intended , they said , `` But we would rather not come to see you at all , Doc '' . 
I think that is the appropriate way to handle medical issues : with preventive measures , to try to stay away from practising physicians . 
I came here in 1993 and was surprised to find that there seemed to be , at the bureaucracy level in Ottawa , a real roadblock to the use of these products . 
I will use an example of two products that I myself found to have roadblocks that I could not explain , either scientifically or just in terms of the regular administrative process . 
The first is melatonin , a natural hormone that our body produces from the pituitary . 
Through scientific research , we have found that melatonin is useful for sleep . 
People take melatonin for jet lag and for the regular things like insomnia . 
I had never taken melatonin myself but I knew people who had , so I thought I would ask them if it had any side effects , or whether it made them feel dozy the next day , and the answer was no . 
Suddenly that product was taken from the Canadian health food shelves . 
I went to the regulators and asked if they had found some harm , some side effects or some contamination . 
The answer was no , so I asked why they took it off the market and , interestingly enough , why did they allow it if a person went to the U.S. and brought it back for personal importation ? 
In my view , there was no satisfactory answer . 
The second product was a sweetener called stevia , a natural , plant-based sweetener . 
It is very sweet . 
I had an opportunity to taste this stuff , to take a little bit on my finger ; it is profoundly sweet . 
A tiny drop of this in tea , coffee or juice sweetens things up . 
It is natural . 
It is from a plant source . 
Stevia was taken off the market . 
I did the same thing for this product and asked why it had been taken off the market . 
I asked if side effects , contamination or harm had been found . 
There was no satisfactory answer . 
Based on that experience , I believe there was some kind of bureaucratic reason to remove those products from Canadian shelves . 
They were taken off the health food shelves . 
They had been available to the public and people could get them from the U.S. through personal importation . 
None of this made sense to me . 
I was on the health committee in those days and had an opportunity to go through the hearing process that the House of Commons went through after the 1997 election . 
During that election it was fascinating , because people who had used a product that was taken off the shelves asked the same questions that I had . 
They asked if there was a reason to take the items away from them . 
They did not get a satisfactory answer , and they actively went out and campaigned for freedom in natural health products . 
That was a factor in many ridings across the country in the 1997 election . 
People in my own riding wanted to know my position . 
I said I was in favour of the most freedom on these products . 
They said that was good and they would vote for me . 
I know there were ridings throughout the country where it was actually a factor in the election . 
Subsequently , with the health minister aware of that , we went through hearings on the issue that were quite fascinating . 
We heard from native healers , Chinese healers and very diverse sections of Canadian society . 
The message to the government was to allow people to take these products for their own health and prevention and not to put up bureaucratic hurdles unless there were good reasons . 
Recommendations came from the health committee and those recommendations , I believe , were sound , secure , thoughtful recommendations . 
What is happening today ? 
This bill is on the table today because of what is happening with Health Canada today . 
Restrictions are being placed on products because products are making health claims . 
I will use an example here , which is not an exact example , to show how absurd that is . 
When Health Canada bureaucrats search natural health publications they may find a product that says `` Vitamin C will prevent scurvy '' .  That is a scientific and medical fact , but if a company takes a vitamin C product and makes the statement that it is a health claim , suddenly a phone call is made and the company is told it is fabricating a product and making a health claim and that if it continues to do that Health Canada will shut it down or fine it . 
Some of these products , quite frankly , have health benefits , preventive benefits in some cases and actual benefits in other cases . 
That is why I will be supporting this private member 's bill at vote time . 
Is it perfect ? 
I listened to the constructive comments of my colleagues across the way and down the way . 
I found those comments to be constructive because this surely is a non-partisan issue . 
Do I have a critique to make of Health Canada on this file ? 
I do . 
These bureaucrats are , in most cases , well intentioned , well meaning individuals , but when it comes to these products I do not think they understand the way they could and should understand the benefits that the products can bring . 
I summarize this issue with a statement that I found to be powerful while campaigning : informed consumes are far better judges of their health care needs than any Health Canada bureaucrat in Ottawa . 
Where should the bureaucrats be involved ? 
Here is the other side of the coin . 
The bureaucrats should be involved when there is evidence of side effects , evidence of contamination or evidence of harm . 
I challenge the bureaucrats on melatonin or on stevia . 
If there is new scientific evidence that melatonin has impacts on society over a period of time , surely that evidence should be brought to bear , made public , allowed scrutiny and allowed rebuttal so that if melatonin is not safe for the Canadian public it would be stricken from the market and the importation for personal use would be banned . 
Surely that is what the Health Canada bureaucrats would want . 
That is what I as a physician would want and every health practitioner in the country would want . 
If there is no such new evidence , if there is no problem with packaging , labelling , side effects , contamination or harm , `` Get out of our face '' is my message to the Health Canada bureaucrats . 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first , I want to congratulate the member for Nanaimo -- Alberni for his bill . 
I have long been a supporter and advocate of the private member 's bill and motion system . 
I myself have had some success through my research to bring ideas to this place and to have good debate . 
The member has achieved that with Bill C-420 . 
I also want to compliment the member on the efforts he made over a long period of time to educate the House on the issue . 
A big part of what we do here is to earn support and respect for issues that we bring forward by providing compelling arguments and evidence that this is something that we should look at . 
I think the member has been quite successful . 
Private members ' bills do not often make it through the entire process . 
Our system in the past has made it extremely difficult for good ideas to find their way into the laws of Canada , but from time to time they do , which is why at this stage it is important that we not be too critical of a private member 's bill that may have been crafted a year or two years ago in terms of the thinking , but that as we have talked about it , obviously there are some suggestions on how we can improve it . 
On this particular item , it is a matter of whether it will go further to the next step . 
Is this an issue that we should be looking at ? 
I do not think there is a member in this place who is not familiar with the arguments related to natural health products . 
It has been with us for a long time . 
It is relevant in probably each and every one of our ridings . 
I think our constituents would want to know that we are looking carefully at all the possibilities . 
I know there are concerns about whether or not health related benefits from certain products are valid or appropriate . 
I am sure there are arguments about whether these products are a food or a drug . 
I was on the health committee for four years and had an opportunity to go through the products when I chaired a subcommittee on Bill C-7 on controlled drugs and substances . 
I know how difficult it can be to get consensus on some of these fine points . 
We went the same route on genetically modified organisms . 
I found Health Canada very rigid in dealing with these matters and I do not think that it should have been . 
We have to be a little more open to this . 
I understand that protecting the health of Canadians is an overarching objective but the evidence of the benefits of natural health products is not just anecdotal . 
It has been proven in virtually centuries of use , which has been handed down from generation to generation , that there really are clear examples . 
Could I explain each one of them ? 
Probably not . 
Are they applicable and helpful to everyone ? 
No , but I am not sure that there is a drug anywhere in the world that is helpful to everybody to the same degree . 
We are all different .  Our circumstances are different . 
This , to me , represents an important option that we as legislators should consider . 
This is an opportunity for us to say that this is an issue that we need to have a closer look at but that we cannot do that unless it goes to the next stage . 
I will be supporting the bill because I think the member has given the House a lot to think about . 
Members have raised some questions which should be explored further and I think the next stage is where that will happen . 
I would not want to see the bill die simply because in some people 's views it is not a perfect bill at this point in time . 
The substantive issue in what the member has raised is the important part . 
I hope that members will give some due consideration to Bill C-420 . 
It is about time we spoke more frankly and deeply about the issues raised by the hon. member about the benefits of natural health products . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
Colleagues , there are seven minutes left in this second hour of debate . 
Is there a taker ? 
If not , I will go to the hon. member for Nanaimo -- Alberni , who has five minutes to conclude the debate . 
Mr. James Lunney ( Nanaimo -- Alberni , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would be quite happy to use the seven minutes , with unanimous consent . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
The hon. member for Nanaimo -- Alberni has asked for unanimous consent to use the full seven minutes . 
Is it agreed ? 
Some hon. members : Agreed . 
Mr. James Lunney : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank all my colleagues who spoke this morning to Bill C-420 , and especially for granting me the extra couple of minutes . 
I appreciate the remarks made by the hon. member for Ancaster -- Dundas -- Flamborough -- Aldershot , who was the first to speak from the government side to the issue , and for the support from my colleagues from Edmonton North and from Macleod . 
I know my colleague from Nanaimo -- Cowichan would have been happy to speak as well . 
Referring to my colleague 's remarks about a third category between food and drugs , in fact , after all the debate that went through the House in 1997 and 1998 with the health committee , the health committee and the transition team made that recommendation . 
Canadians were led to believe they would be getting a third category , not food , not drugs , but it would be in the middle ; physiologically active nutrients that have a health benefit , whether it is identified by tradition , hundreds of years of use with no apparent harm , whether it is identified by scientific investigation or whether it is absolutely proven beyond a shadow of a doubt , as are many health products . 
The unfortunate thing is that Health Canada reneged on the legislative renewal that would have created the third category . 
It simply said that it would have a new health products directorate . 
The Office of Natural Health Products was set up and NHPs were placed squarely as a subclass of drugs . 
Unfortunately , the legislative renewal that was promised to accompany the regulations , which will come into effect in January 2004 , has been scrubbed . 
I see , and I believe many Canadians see , that as a betrayal of the confidence and trust that Canadians put into the process . 
The legislative renewal would have required addressing the antiquated subsections 3(1) and 3(2) that say one shall not label and advertise that a vitamin , mineral , herbal or natural health product will influence a whole schedule of diseases ; schedule A that has been discussed this morning . 
If it were only the labelling and advertising issue , I do not think it would be as serious . 
It is the consequence of that section that is so serious . 
The consequence is that Health Canada says that as soon as a health claim is made the product is then taken off the market unless it goes through a multi-million dollar drug approval process , which simply is inappropriate for a natural health product that is not patentable . 
The point that I have been trying to get across is that natural health products are not patentable . 
Drug companies make huge investments into products for which they hope to receive profits . 
The health committee is now looking at this . 
The industry committee was looking at the patent extensions of 20 years and now , with ever-greening multiple years beyond that , for profits on a patented drug . 
However natural health products have no such patents . 
Therefore , the pharma world is not interested , it seems , in promoting that kind of research . 
It seems to me it is fundamentally wrong for Health Canada to force a natural product through that kind of approval regime . 
There has been some confusion about what Bill C-420 would actually do . 
Bill C-420 would not gut the whole Office of Natural Health Products directorate . 
It would simply move it from under a drug style directorate to under a food style directorate . 
We could still have the good manufacturing practices and the inspections . 
We could still make sure that what is on the bottle is in the bottle . 
We could still provide assurance of health claims . 
We could review them to determine whether a health claim is traditional without evidence of harm . 
We could provide Canadians with assurances that the health claim has some scientific validity . 
The question of safety is not really an issue . 
Where there is an issue of safety we would all be in agreement . 
Evidence should be brought forth and if it were dangerous then we would address it in a public manner . 
What is outrageous is that Health Canada would take products that might improve the health of Canadians off the market . 
Frankly , I think Canadians would find that unacceptable . 
A simple mineral supplement like chromium picolinate is absolutely essential for blood sugar metabolism . 
That is true for all members of the House . 
We cannot metabolize sugar without chromium . 
We excrete it when we metabolize sugar . 
The fact that Health Canada would take that most physiologically effective form off the market seems to be fundamentally perverse and contrary to the public interest . 
A mineral supplement , which was developed in Alberta , called E.M.Power+ , has been helping Canadians with a mental illness known as bipolar disease or manic depression . 
There is a tremendous cost to the individuals and there is a high risk of suicide . 
We actually have people in the House today who are here because they are concerned . 
They are watching the debate and many are watching across the country because they are concerned . 
They feel their lives are being threatened because Health Canada is taking the products off the market simply because people begin to tell others that this could help them with their mental illness . 
There are over 3,000 Canadians receiving help from this product and yet Health Canada would move to take it off the market . 
They want to know , why would Health Canada do this when there is evidence of benefit ? 
I would like to give an example . 
There was a lady from Ontario who had been on psychiatric drugs for 18 years . 
Her husband had been on suicide watch for many years . 
She has been taking this vitamin and mineral product for about two and a half years and she is off her psychiatric drugs . 
She is not trying to kill herself or her husband any more . 
She is holding down a job , paying taxes and she is volunteering . 
She wants to know , why would Health Canada take this away from her ? 
Frankly , so do I. 
Folic acid is well known as the best defence against heart attack and stroke . 
Health Canada knows that and it is reported in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology . 
If a simple vitamin , folic acid , is a better defence than anything else we know of , would Canadians not want to know about it ? 
Like the statement from Shakespeare , I feel that there is something rotten in the state of Denmark , with no reference to any member on the other side . 
But there is something wrong with the way Health Canada manages natural health products . 
The new Natural Health Products Directorate is maintaining antiquated subsections 3(1) and 3(2) , and will continue to take products with a health claim off the market . 
Health Canada sent the police to raid the computers of a little company in Raymond , Alberta , and has obstructed delivery of the product . 
In times when health costs are spiralling , Canadians would expect Health Canada to have an interest in a product that might lower the cost , lower the morbidity of a serious disease , and improve clinical outcomes . 
That was the approach of the Province of Alberta when it heard about the effect that E.M.Power+ was having on Albertans , it asked to look into this . 
There are huge costs associated with it . 
A $ 544,000 study was set up at the University of Calgary under the leadership of Dr. Bonnie Kaplan . 
Canadians feel betrayed and certainly the people taking the product who have their lives back feel betrayed when Health Canada hears about this and moves in to shut down the study . 
Is there no room for science to progress the treatment of disease ? 
There in an excellent article in the September issue of Saturday Night called `` A Prescription for Profit '' which talked about the attitude of the drug companies looking at sickness as a marketing opportunity . 
Frankly , it is known that mental illness is expected to increase in Canada by about 25 % over the next 10 years . 
It seems that the drug companies are positioning themselves to capture the market . 
Many of the drug companies mistakenly take a patent on a product that is being used to treat an illness and consider it a patent on the illness itself . 
There is something fundamentally wrong with that . 
That is made even worse if Health Canada is complicit in maintaining that which is contrary to the public interest . 
It seems to me that Health Canada ought to be on the forefront of advancing opportunities to advance health care in Canada . 
If a natural health product can do that , Canadians have a right to know and have a right to access low risk products . 
I encourage members to think about this issue seriously . 
I would be quite in favour of a third category . 
It would mean opening the act . 
The reason I put it as a subclass of food is because of the response of Health Canada . 
Under the food directorate we can still have the good manufacturing practices , inspections , and the safety that people require without having the bureaucratic and heavy-handed response of a drug style directorate .

moved that the bill be read the third time and passed . 
He said : Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to speak today in support of Bill C-37 , an act to amend the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act . 
The Canadian Forces Superannuation Act was introduced in 1960 . 
Although improvements have been made over the years , there have been no major reviews or amendments for over 30 years , with the exception of those made in 1999 in conjunction with federal public service superannuation reform . 
While the fundamental principles of the act remain valid , Canadian society and Canadian Forces services have changed considerably over the last three decades . 
These changes must be reflected in the human resources policies and practices of our military . 
For example , the Canadian Forces , like most other militaries in the western world , have been confronting a recruitment and retention challenge in recent years . 
Competition for skilled workers is intense and the employment options available to Canadians with the right qualifications are greater than ever . 
In order to be competitive in today 's labour market , the Canadian Forces has adopted a number of measures to position itself as an employer of choice . 
A modern , flexible and effective pension plan that provides our military members with more control and choice regarding their career and financial planning would go a long way in helping the Canadian Forces achieve this goal and help it overcome the recruitment and retention challenges it is now facing . 
However , modernizing the pension legislation for the Canadian military is not just about helping the Canadian Forces attract the best and the brightest candidates . 
It is also about ensuring that our men and women in uniform are taken care of , have confidence in their futures , and are appropriately compensated for their service . 
In short , this is an important quality of life issue . 
The Government of Canada has made great strides in recent years in improving the quality of life of Canadian military personnel and their families . 
Pay and benefits for Armed Forces members have been improved , the military health system has been enhanced , and there is greater support for family members . 
The Government of Canada cannot rest on its laurels , however . 
It will continue to ensure the well-being of Canadian men and women in uniform . 
The amendments contained in the bill represent another significant step forward in the quality of life file by bringing fairness , flexibility , and inclusion to the military pension plan . 
The bill before the House today would modernize military pensions through a series of both major and minor amendments to the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act . 
For example , some of the changes being proposed in Bill C-37 would shorten the period of time required to qualify for a pension benefit from 10 years to 2 years , improve pension portability , provide entitlement to an immediate unreduced pension after 25 years of service in the Canadian Forces , improve pension benefits for survivors , and provide pension coverage for our reservists . 
This last amendment regarding reservists is particularly important . 
Before continuing , I wish to point out that the shift from 20 years to 25 years of service for an immediate unreduced pension will not disadvantage any member of the Canadian Forces because each member is entitled to make the choice between the new system and the old system , whichever of these two systems is better for the member in question . 
Turning now to reservists , whether it is assisting Canadians during forest fires , hurricanes or other times of crisis , or contributing to Canada 's international commitments , our reservists provide dedicated , professional , and essential service to the Canadian Forces , to the country , and to all Canadians . 
We have a duty therefore to ensure that they are appropriately recognized and compensated for this service . 
The amendments set out in the bill bring long term , full time reservists under the same pension arrangements as their regular force counterparts . 
The bill also lays the foundation needed to develop a pension plan for reservists who serve on a part time basis . 
The implementation of a pension plan for Canada 's reservists is an issue the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs , among others , has worked hard for in recent years . 
I am proud to say that today we are one step closer to achieving this goal . 
A concerted effort was made to ensure the views and concerns of key stakeholders were considered in the development of these proposed amendments . 
The Canadian Forces Pension Advisory Committee , the formal body responsible for advising me on pension matters , was consulted regularly and has endorsed the reform proposals . 
Extensive briefings , focus groups , and other communications opportunities were used to inform and solicit feedback from regular and reserve force members . 
Members from both the regular and reserve forces support the proposed amendments . 
I would like to emphasize the government 's continuing commitment to consulting and communicating with pension plan members throughout the whole modernization process , including the development of regulations and implementation arrangements . 
With this modernization of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act , Parliament will not be required to pass supplementary estimates . 
Nor will it be necessary to draw additional funds from the Defence Services Program . 
The increases arising out of this modernization exercise will be part of the existing financial framework . 
The chief actuary of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions feels that the other changes proposed in Bill C-37 would not lead to any cost increases . 
Instead , there might even be some slight savings . 
The benefits associated with this legislation are self-evident . 
However , in conclusion , I would like to reiterate two key reasons why this legislation is critical for the Canadian Forces and by extension , all Canadians . 
First , the amendments would provide for a pension plan that better meets the needs of our regular and reserve force members , and their families . 
It would ensure that they get the benefits they need and deserve . 
Second , the proposed changes to the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act will assist the Canadian Forces in the critical areas of recruitment and retention by positioning the military as an employer of choice . 
For these reasons , I hope the House will support the bill . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George -- Peace River , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the words of the Minister of National Defence on this very important issue . 
My question for the minister deals with amendments that I brought forward on behalf of the official opposition at committee stage of the bill . 
They deal with the fact that under Bill C-37 , as is the case with the vast majority of legislation that is passed through this place , the minister has the power of course to develop , implement and enact regulations . 
The concern I expressed at committee was that there should be a serious commitment . 
I was hoping to have something in writing that would require the minister and/or the department not only to consult as he referred to in his remarks , but actually a commitment that he or his department communicate any impending changes directly and in writing to the stakeholders , to the actual contributors and to the pensioners , as it were . 
I was reassured at committee by the parliamentary secretary to the minister that , although it was not in writing , because of the structure of the Canadian Forces Pension Advisory Committee and the Service Pension Board which would continue to administer this , two way communication would take place . 
Therefore the stakeholders would not find themselves in a situation sometime in the future where , if they did not read the Gazette , they would not find out about some important change that would affect their bottom line . 
Could the minister comment on that particular concern ? 
Hon. John McCallum : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for his party 's support for the bill . 
It certainly helps us to get it through the House in an expeditious manner . 
I also take seriously the comments he made . 
Certainly this is a good news change in the pension system . 
To the best of my knowledge , because of the grandfathering arrangement , I do not think any individual should be affected negatively by it . 
The hon. member has my undertaking today that the department will indeed communicate with , inform and have meetings with the stakeholders to the maximum extent possible so that everybody is fully informed and that people have an opportunity to raise any concerns that they may have . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George -- Peace River , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I must say at the outset that I certainly appreciate the opportunity to speak to this very important legislation as the minister has just outlined . 
It will improve the pension benefits of members of the Canadian armed forces . 
This is the first opportunity I have had since becoming the national defence critic for the official opposition to speak to defence related issues in the House of Commons . 
In 1998 the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs released a report on the quality of life in the Canadian Forces . 
The report contained a recommendation that members of the reserve force in our military should also be eligible to receive benefits under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act . 
Today , five years later , legislation to implement this recommendation as well as modernize and enhance pension benefits is finally working its way through Parliament . 
Overall , the legislative changes contained within Bill C-37 are welcome . 
For that reason the Canadian Alliance will be supporting this progressive initiative that should have been done many years ago . 
Once the legislation comes into effect , members of the Canadian Forces will be offered pension benefits which are more in line with what is offered to employees of the public service and the private sector . 
The new superannuation plan will calculate pension benefits using years of pensionable service instead of terms of service . 
The legislation will allow members to obtain early access to benefits from the age of 50 . 
Members who decide to leave the Canadian Forces will also be allowed to take the value of their pension with them . 
Members of the reserve force will finally be able to receive a proper pension benefit . 
The inclusion of the reserve force is perhaps one of the more important changes contained within the legislation . 
The reserves have always been a critical component of our Canadian armed forces . 
It is about time the government acted to put in place some sort of substantive acknowledgment of their contribution to our military . 
I have always been more than a bit upset with how our reserves have been treated in the past . 
I have already referred to my concerns about adequate communications with the contributors , the pensioners , in the future . 
My concern was not so much with consultations , which I readily acknowledge the minister mentioned in his remarks have been conducted up to this point . 
There has been widespread consultation , and I do not dispute for a moment the facts as the minister presented them that contributors and by and large stakeholders both in the reserves and the regular forces are very supportive of this legislation . 
My concern is in the future , perhaps when the present minister is no longer the minister , that communication and any future regulations would actually be required to be communicated directly to the people that are affected . 
It is not necessarily today or even tomorrow , but years in the future . 
Not long ago I was contacted by one of our true wartime heroes , Cliff Wenzel , a veteran who fought during several conflicts as a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force . 
He has also been awarded several decorations resulting from his service to our country . 
After serving some 20 years in the air force , Mr. Wenzel decided to apply for early retirement on a reduced pension and continue his involvement in the air force as a squadron leader in the auxiliary reserve . 
For some strange reason still unknown to Mr. Wenzel , after some 40 years he was denied a reduced pension because his early retirement was deemed not in the public interest . 
According to the government , spending 10 years in the air force reserve was not in the public interest . 
This has left Mr. Wenzel with absolutely no pension , after spending a total of 30 years in the air force , 20 years in active regular service and 10 years in the reserve . 
Let us be clear . 
Mr. Wenzel served 20 years in the regular air force , another 10 years in the reserves , and the government has deemed his service to our country does not qualify him for an early reduced pension . 
Unfortunately , over the past while there have been quite a few cases that are similar to Mr. Wenzel 's where our veterans have received no benefits from the Canadian Forces . 
Major Bruce Henwood discovered to his amazement that he was not eligible for lump sum compensation after losing both his legs in Croatia . 
Last year the situation of Lieutenant Colonel Al Trotter was raised in the House by my colleague , the member for Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , after he was denied a prisoner of war pension supplement . 
These instances of outright neglect by the government unfortunately seem to be all too symptomatic of its overall disregard for our Canadian military . 
The government 's disdain for our military extends beyond its poor treatment of our veterans even to the men and women who presently serve in the Canadian Forces . 
As recently as last week I launched a campaign with the help of a military spouse , Ms. Sheri Gauthier , to protest impending rent increases for military housing units on base provided by the Canadian Forces Housing Agency . 
Sadly , many military families living in those housing units are forced to sacrifice their quality of life as all too often the homes are in disrepair and well below acceptable housing standards . 
Yet the government is imposing on many of the units substantial rent increases well above acceptable provincial levels . 
It is simply unimaginable what some of our military families have to put up with when living in housing on base . 
Many of these families are tired of keeping quiet about the shoddy housing they are provided with . 
However the majority refuse to speak out for fear of reprisal . 
If members of the House need further evidence , they need only travel down the road and visit CFB Rockcliffe , only a few minutes away from Parliament Hill . 
At a time when homelessness is such a serious concern , extra housing units at this base were offered to homeless individuals in the Ottawa area . 
However , if we can believe it , these homes are in such poor condition the city of Ottawa would not allow the homeless to move into them . 
It must have been quite disheartening for the military families who still reside there to be deemed to be the exception to the rule . 
The long term neglect of our military personnel on the part of government needs to come to an end . 
The men and women who serve in the Canadian Forces are our military . 
Without them we cannot defend our borders , protect our country and assist those in need at home and abroad . 
If the government wants to improve the sorry state of the Canadian Forces , it needs to stop its sorry treatment of our military personnel . 
To do this , the government should start by doing three things . 
First , it could start by paying our military personnel better wages . 
Second , it could start by investing in properly equipping our military with the tools they need to do their job . 
Third , the government needs to start giving our Canadian Forces personnel the proper respect and recognition they deserve for their hard work . 
I was reading the local paper this morning at home before I came to work . 
I noticed in the letters to the editor section of the Ottawa Citizen that one of the letters talked about the moving service for the two soldiers who tragically recently lost their lives , Sergeant Short and Corporal Beerenfenger . 
I will quote from the letter in the Ottawa Citizen of Monday , October 20 , 2003 : 
Lieutenant-General Rick Hillier , commander of the army , presided over the service and spoke with dignity , respect and compassion . 
A powerful speaker , he uttered the most truthful words : `` It is the soldier , not the politician , who is the hero . 
It is the soldier , not the bureaucracy , that gives us democracy '' . 
That jumped out at me because I thought no truer words were ever spoken and only adds to the issue that I have with the government on how it treats our military . 
The legislation we are debating today , Bill C-37 , makes a positive improvement to the benefits our military personnel receive . 
There is no question of that . 
However , yet again I would argue that more needs to be done . 
Men and women starting a career in the Canadian Forces certainly do not expect to be paid lavish wages . 
They do expect to be paid a fair salary that will allow them to maintain a reasonable lifestyle . 
With ever-increasing cost of living expenses such as car insurance , gas and now even rent , the salaries paid to our military personnel are being stretched thin . 
The government must ensure that the salaries paid to our Canadian Forces personnel are adequate and properly reflect their hard work and their service to our country . 
We need only reflect back a couple of years ago . 
An exposé was done on one of our national newscasts and I do not remember whether it was CBC or CTV . 
It revealed a sad and humiliating spectacle of Canadian Forces families going to get their groceries at local food banks . 
They did not have adequate remuneration to actually buy groceries for their young children and I thought how sad . 
I know there have been improvements made since then , but much more needs to be done , and I think the minister would agree with that . 
The men and women of the Canadian Forces do not ask for much , I argue . 
Day in and day out they perform their duties and carry out the tasks assigned to them and fulfill missions given to them by our government . 
All the while our Canadian Forces do an exemplary job and consistently exceed expectations . 
All they ask for in return is some recognition by their government of their job well done . 
Earlier , I mentioned Mr. Cliff Wenzel , a retired air force pilot who wants more than anything else just some recognition by his government for his service in the reserves . 
He wants his government on the record stating that the 10 years he spent in the reserves was in the public interest . 
Those in the military today want their government to be proud of the work they do , not ashamed of the fact that our military occasionally might have to use physical force to save the lives of innocent civilians while serving on peacekeeping missions overseas . 
The folks who serve in our Canadian Forces do an excellent job . 
I cannot understand why the government will not give them more money so we can have resources to help those in need around the world . 
Another area of improvement for our Canadian Forces involves a serious investment on the part of the government to provide our forces with the tools they need to do the jobs to which they are assigned . 
The equipment deficiencies of our military are so extensive that I could go on at length highlighting the serious need for reinvestment . 
I simply do not have enough time to go down the almost endless list of things that need replacing . 
Instead , I will touch on the more important equipment procurement priorities . 
I appreciate that the minister is listening to my remarks . 
Perhaps during questions and answers he could bring the House and Canadians , who are watching the debate , up to speed on where we stand with procurement of some of the essential needs of our armed forces . 
I , like so many others , have been going on ad nauseam about the maritime helicopter project . 
It still serves as the best example of a bungled procurement project to replace the fleet of aging Sea King helicopters . 
Our navy works tirelessly maintaining these aircraft to ensure they are safe and available for use when they are needed . 
The cost to keep these helicopters in the air well past their shelf lives is in the tens of millions of dollars a year . 
For the past 10 years , ever since the government came to power in 1993 , the pilots who fly these aircraft and the technicians who work to keep them in the air have been waiting patiently for their government to purchase new replacements . 
Needless to say , if the outgoing Prime Minister had not , `` with a single stroke of his pen , '' cancelled the original replacement contract , our service personnel would not have been left waiting for new aircraft and we would not be continuing to spend outrageous sums of money in an attempt to keep 40 year old helicopters in the air . 
Likewise , the air force is confronting a similar problem with its primary workhorse aircraft that we continue to deploy around the globe , the C-130 Hercules . 
Currently , two-thirds of the fleet has been grounded periodically due to maintenance problems . 
The bulk of these planes , similar to the Sea Kings , are approaching 40 years in service . 
Has the government stepped forward to address this serious problem ? 
I would argue , not really . 
Instead of putting plans in place to purchase new replacement aircraft , the Minister of National Defence is scrounging for used parts , specifically airframes and the shells of the aircraft to keep them in the air . 
An hon. member : Unbelievable . 
Mr. Jay Hill : One of my colleagues said , `` unbelievable '' . 
I cannot think of a better word . 
I used to farm out in the real world before I became a federal politician . 
I farmed for some 20 years . 
My brother and I , when we were farming our 3,000 acres in the Peace country , recognized that to do the job we had to constantly upgrade our equipment if we were to have any hope of being able to get the crop in on time and get it off on time in the fall . 
All the armed forces is asking is for something similar . 
If we were to have run our farm the way the government runs the Canadian armed forces , we would have been farming with 40 year old little tractors held together with duct tape , binder twine and baling wire . 
However we did not . 
We recognized a cost to doing business and we upgraded continually . 
A few weeks ago it came to light that the equipment problems of our air force had compromised its ability to carry out the primary function of a maritime border patrol . 
The Minister of National Defence has resorted to looking to private companies to conduct patrols of our maritime borders because of a lack of money and equipment resources to carry out this function . 
The most disturbing part of it all was the admission by the defence minister that his department was actually doing this . 
Perhaps now is as good a time as any to remind the government of its chronic bad luck when dealing with contractors . 
I believe it was not too long ago a former minister of defence had to send out a military crew to forcefully board and seize an ocean freighter on the high seas that refused to return Canadian military equipment to port . 
For our current defence minister to see no problem with a contractor carrying out a primary national security function , I find deeply disturbing . 
The last piece of equipment I will mention today has received quite a bit of media attention in recent days . 
I am referring to the Iltus scout car , which in its own right has garnered a lengthy history of political interference up until the very end , leading to the delay of its replacement . 
Almost 20 years ago the Liberal government of the day decided to purchase the Iltus , despite concerns raised about the vehicle by the army at the time . 
These jeeps were originally to be built by the supplier in Germany at a cost of $ 26,500 each . 
The only problem with this was no jobs were to be created in Canada . 
At a 250 % premium , the government decided to have the Iltus built in Canada by Bombardier at a cost of $ 84,000 per vehicle . 
For that much money , we could have purchased the larger armoured Humvees the army wanted , but instead we received a vehicle with no armour protection and a canvas cover and doors . 
I am dismayed to say that I and others have been remiss in referring to these vehicles as jeeps . 
I have been contacted by DaimlerChrysler and told it resents that , and justifiably so . 
These are not Jeeps . 
Jeep is a trademark of that company . 
I am a proud owner of two Jeeps . 
I have a Grand Cherokee Jeep in the riding and a TJ Jeep here in Ottawa , so I do not want to demean the good reputation and name of Jeep by referring to the Iltus as a jeep . 
The Iltus has been slated for replacement since the mid-1990s , yet today we still find them in use within an active theatre of operations . 
At the outset of this procurement project , four reputable suppliers were interested in furnishing our land forces with new vehicles . 
However true to form , the Liberal government once again interfered in the procurement process to ensure there were political gains to be made . 
As a result , there is only one supplier remaining , which will probably be awarded the contract by default . 
The remaining suppliers withdrew their bids on the project because of the unacceptable political interference . 
The most troubling legacy from this interference is that we are no longer afforded the luxury of choosing the best vehicle from a selection of choices . 
We only have one supplier willing to put up with the government 's nonsense . 
If the government truly wishes to end its reputation of neglecting our Canadian forces , it needs to demonstrate a true commitment to our military on a variety of fronts . 
This commitment must be principled and has to be backed up with action and financial resources . 
With a strong military , Canada can take its rightful place on the international stage once again as a peaceful nation willing to step forward to not only help those in need , but to promote and defend the democratic principles we all too often unfortunately take for granted here at home . 
Currently , this is not the case . 
Canadians have been witness to their nation 's declining reputation on the international stage . 
Canada is no longer a world leader in peacekeeping . 
We now rank behind more than 30 other countries in the world on the UN list . 
Due to the overextension of our Canadian forces , Canada is forced to hastily withdraw forces from Bosnia and the Golan Heights in order to meet our commitments in Afghanistan . 
At home , Canadians are watching their federal government remain absolutely silent on one of the most important developments affecting our homeland security with the American 's implementation of the ballistic missile defence program . 
The member for LaSalle -- Émard , who is patiently waiting to take the keys for 24 Sussex , refuses to indicate his support or opposition to the program , unless the minister can inform me otherwise today . 
The ballistic missile defence program is set to begin the initial phases of implementation as early as next year . 
I just came back from Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs where I had some great briefings with Norad . 
I can tell members that Norad is in jeopardy if we do not opt into this thing wholeheartedly and work with the Americans to provide continental security through the missile defence program . 
My time is over . 
I would like to conclude by reiterating our support for Bill C-37 . 
However , as I have touched upon , much more needs to be done on many other fronts to improve our Canadian armed forces . 
Hon. John McCallum ( Minister of National Defence , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member raised many issues and asked for my response . 
Could I ask how much time I have ? 
The Deputy Speaker : 
If the Chair interpreted the number of members indicating they wanted to ask questions , the Chair , if I may use the term in a non-partisan fashion , will be liberal with its time with the clock .  I will divide the time evenly . 
There is a 10 minute period for questions or comments , so let us start with five minutes for the Minister of National Defence , if he should use up all that five minutes . 
Hon. John McCallum : 
Mr. Speaker , five minutes will be plenty . 
I would like to respond to two aspects of the member 's speech . 
He covers a broad range of topics , much of which , quite naturally , I would disagree with . 
For example , on ballistic missile defence , the talks with the Americans have been ongoing through the summer . 
I am told these talks are progressing well , so this is on stream . 
However , in my very brief minutes I want to address two of the themes he raised .  The first of these themes is the tools to do the job and the second is the human dimension . 
No one believes more strongly than I do that we must , as a government , provide our soldiers with the tools to do the job when we put them in harm 's way . 
With regard to Afghanistan , that is why from the very start I have made absolutely certain that everything requested in terms of equipment was delivered on time . 
This will also be true with the request for additional armoured vehicles , which was made last week . 
Those will be delivered exactly as requested and on time . 
More generally , we received an $ 800 million increase in our base budget in the last budget and $ 160 million of this I have devoted to our capital program . 
So our capital program is larger ; moreover , it is more stable . 
Whereas in the past , with an unsustainable budget , we had to dip into the capital budget to finance current operations , this is no longer the case . 
For the first time in many years , the department has engaged in a long term capital planning project with greater stability in the budget and greater dollars . 
I have been participating actively in this . 
I will just refer very briefly to two issues the hon. member raises . 
One is the replacement of the helicopter . 
Clearly , as I have said in the House many times , it is a very high priority for me to replace that helicopter as fast as possible . 
To that end , early in my time as defence minister I changed from a two contract system to a one contract system . 
All the stakeholders agree that this move increased the speed of delivery while at the same time it reduced risk . 
I have made it a top priority . 
I have told the department this : that in the short run , we must increase the serviceability of the Hercules and , in the medium term , the capacity . 
Progress has been made and we are working on this matter . 
On the second theme , the human condition , when I first became defence minister I had limited experience with the military . 
It did not take me long to discover from first-hand observation and conversations that these wonderful people do a fantastic job for our country and put their lives on the line for us , as we have seen so sadly in recent times , and I wish to do what I can within my power to improve the living conditions of the military and their families . 
I might say , and here I give some praise to my predecessor , that much has been done over the last five to ten years to improve those living conditions . 
Salaries have been increased substantially . 
The health care system has been improved . 
Family resource centres have been increased in number and in quality . 
Yes , there remains more to be done .  There always does .  But we as a government have put the people first over the last five to ten years , and I think a dispassionate observer would agree that the quality of life of our men and women in the Canadian Forces has improved in a significant way . 
This bill we are about to pass will move in that direction . 
Finally , the hon. member mentioned Major Bruce Henwood . 
This was a personal initiative of mine . 
When I discovered that Major Bruce Henwood was denied his $ 200,000 or $ 300,000 in compensation for losing his legs , because he was a major rather than a colonel , I thought that made no sense . 
I spent quite a few months , while facing quite a lot of resistance in the bureaucracy , to change that anomaly , so that from now on anyone in the Canadian Forces , whether a private , a corporal , a colonel or a general , who loses his or her legs in a military situation would receive this compensation . 
I felt very strongly myself that this was absolutely wrong .  It had to be changed . 
The opposition agreed with me , for which I am thankful , and we got that changed . 
As of now , both retroactively and going into the future , a person who loses his or her legs will receive that settlement irrespective of rank . 
In conclusion , I think that both my predecessor and now I myself did and do take the human condition of the men and women of the Canadian Forces very seriously and , while there is always work to do , we have made significant progress over the last ten years . 
This bill we are about to pass is one further piece of evidence of that commitment and that progress we continue to make . 
Mr. Jay Hill : 
Mr. Speaker , I first want to say , and I mean this sincerely , I appreciate that the Minister of National Defence remained in the House , listened to my remarks and obviously took them to heart . 
Even though he said , by his own admission , that he disagrees with much of what I said , that does not detract from the fact that I , as a member of the opposition , appreciate that he remained in the House and addressed my concerns . 
I only wish that more ministers would learn from that , would make themselves available to the opposition during debate in the House of Commons and respond in a good way to the questions , and would put forward the opposite arguments where they are to be put forward . 
Very quickly , I want to try to address a few of the points the minister raised . 
On missile defence , the minister states that it is on stream . 
On stream ? 
This has been 20 years in the making . 
I support the fact that at least we are talking about it and I commend the minister for at least moving the ball that far , but I think we should have public statements made on where we stand , and certainly the member for LaSalle -- Émard , as the incoming leader of the Liberal government , should be making public statements on where he stands on that issue . 
Surely after 20 years he has decided where he stands on it if he wants to be the prime minister of the country . 
Next is the request for additional armoured vehicles . 
One of the reasons I raised the issue of the Iltis , not only in my speech but over the past number of weeks since that unfortunate tragedy , is that the fact remains : if the government had replaced them when they were due to be replaced four or five years ago , and in fact even then they were overdue to be replaced , they would not be in theatre in Afghanistan .  We would not have those vehicles there . 
We would have something better than those vehicles : something more dependable and safer . 
As I said , and as the minister admitted , the investigation is still ongoing into that unfortunate tragedy . 
We do not yet know all the ramifications of that particular incident . 
Maybe it will be shown that it would not have mattered what those two soldiers were riding in on that particular day ; maybe , unfortunately and tragically , they would have been killed anyway . 
But we do know that in that particular vehicle , they had no chance , none . 
My argument , and it remains valid , I believe , is that had we replaced those vehicles , had we moved as a nation and , in his defence , before this minister was minister , and had the government moved as a government and replaced those vehicles with something like the armoured Humvees the Americans use , their chances of survival would have been much higher . 
I stand by that . 
Yes , we saw an improvement last year with some $ 800 million in the defence budget . 
We on this side lauded that . 
We recognized , though , that it was insufficient . 
I think even the minister recognized that . 
He would have liked to have had more . 
Much more needs to be done on this . 
We have to allocate more resources for our Canadian armed forces . 
He referred to $ 160 million in the capital expenditure budget ; it is simply not enough . 
I think the minister himself would admit that it is not enough . 
There are too many items in our inventory that are long overdue for replacement . 
Referring to the helicopters , I wrote down what the minister said . 
Basically , he said as fast as it can be accomplished . 
He is trying to move expeditiously and it remains a number one priority . 
There again , similar to missile defence , it was ten years ago that this Prime Minister , this outgoing Prime Minister , with a single stroke of his pen , cancelled those helicopters , the EH-101s . 
Since then , for ten years the government has been trying to rig the procurement process so that the EH-101 and the models that have replaced it do not qualify . 
It has been reducing the requirements and reducing the criteria to try , for political reasons , to get other helicopters to meet the requirements , so that the government and the Prime Minister do not have to be embarrassed by ten years later buying virtually the same helicopter with the improved avionics , which we should have had ten years ago . 
The last thing : put the people first . 
I would argue that sadly there are far too many examples which show that much more needs to be done . 
Yes , improvements have been made , and I concede that to the minister , but much more needs to be done . 
I used one example , that of the upcoming rent increases for many of our Canadian armed forces families . 
These are young families . 
At a time when we are at war on terror , many of these people are deployed overseas . 
They are under an incredible amount of stress and anxiety and , at this very time , the government is going to increase the rent on their houses . 
They are not even sure if mom or dad is going to come home . 
Something is wrong here , and then the minister turns around and says the government is putting people first . 
I do not think so . 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint-Jean , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois , I am pleased to speak to Bill C-37 today . 
I will start by saying that I will try to devote most of my speech to the pension fund . 
I think that is the issue today , not necessarily equipment , although I think that is part of it . 
Indeed , quality of life for the Canadian Forces also depends a great deal on their equipment , government decisions and especially the perception that Quebeckers and Canadians have of the Canadian Forces . 
Unfortunately , I am among those who say that the true worth of the Canadian Forces is not being recognized . 
The debate is often on the wrong track and centres on equipment or money . 
Yet , goodness knows , for a few years now we have been pushing for the adoption of a new national defence policy that would set out the challenges , guidelines and parameters for government funding . 
This could influence the purchase of equipment and change our behaviour on the international stage . 
I think this is all closely linked . 
As I was saying , the true worth of the Canadian Forces is not recognized . 
I know this first hand . 
I had the opportunity to train with the Royal 22e Régiment in Valcartier ; the soldiers were being sent to Bosnia on relief . 
One 's view depends on whether one is inside or outside the ranks . 
I had a rather full week : the troops got up at sunrise , and went to bed very late in the evening after all the physical and psychological training that comes with preparing for a dangerous mission . 
Spending a day with the Royal 22e Régiment preparing for an international peace mission makes one realize this is not fun and games . 
I have also seen the PPCLI at work in my riding , during the ice storm . 
They did not come as tourists . 
These men and women spent their time clearing roads and chopping wood for those without power . 
They worked from sunup to sundown . 
When they left , I told the PPCLI soldiers that we would never forget them . 
That is why , from time to time in my speeches , I talk about the PPCLI to express my admiration for these individuals . 
Training is one thing , but taking part in operations is completely different . 
I took part in two . 
As I just mentioned , I accompanied the ninth rotation to Bosnia . 
So , there had been other rotations before I went . 
Some of the people taking part in the ninth rotation had already taken part in the fourth and fifth rotation . 
Over there , we can see the magnitude of what happened during the war between the Croatians and the Bosnians . 
One out of every three houses has no roof ; there were huge losses of life . 
The soldiers spoke about the Canadian camps being shelled . 
Once , they were called to go get children at a school and take them back to the camp so they would be under military protection , but then they were informed that the children were not allowed in the camp . 
When the soldiers went back out after the bombing , the children had all died outside the walls to the Canadian camp . 
There are not just physical dangers , but also enormous emotional stress . 
That is why , now , it has been determined that post-traumatic stress disorder is a direct result of this kind of situation . 
I also accompanied the minister to Eritrea and Ethiopia where the two camps were separated by an international boundary . 
I saw dead bodies lying amidst mine fields , left there because apparently there was no time to recover the bodies and the whole area needed to be demined to do it . 
This creates a great deal of insecurity within the Canadian Forces . 
We often think that they are tough people , but they are human beings , too . 
We need only observe their friendship with the local population as they offer a little solace for the horrors these people live through day by day . 
Therefore we think that debating this bill to improve the retirement conditions for Canadian Forces pensioners is a step in the right direction . 
Recruitment is not the only thing that counts . 
I believe that the current problem is that young people thinking of enlisting have a choice between private enterprise or the Canadian Forces , a federal institution . 
They often decide to enlist in the forces for adventure . 
Nevertheless , some basic conditions must be met : the salary must be good enough and the pension plan as well . 
I think that the bill before us will improve the situation in many ways . 
I think the government has been rather slow in dealing with the reservists . 
But , as the saying goes , `` better late than never . '' 
In its 1998 report on quality of life in the Canadian Forces , the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs recommended `` that the Department of National Defence pursue initiatives to put in place a real pension plan for the Reserves , '' because they were not previously eligible for pensions . 
Consequently , special attention is being given to creation of a pension plan for reservists . 
Clearly , reservists may have other jobs . 
Now , if they want to re-enlist , the time they spent in the militia or reserve will count towards a pension at the end of their career , which is very good . 
I would like to point out how important reservists are , and will be in future , because people wanting to make a career in the Armed Forces are not exactly beating down the doors of recruiting offices . 
I know that considerable efforts are under way at the present time to recruit people . 
In fact , there is a Canadian Forces recruiting centre is in my riding and it is always busy . 
This is interesting , but when people enlist they need to know what to expect when they retire 10 , 15 , 20 or 25 years down the line . 
This is , in my opinion , important . 
Now reservists will have the possibility of accumulating pensionable time , so that when they end their career , be it in the Armed Forces or elsewhere , they will have a slightly better pension plan than before , as they would in the federal public service . 
Speaking of the importance of reservists , I again think of Valcartier . 
Several battalions were deployed to Bosnia during my rotation . 
One of these was wholly comprised of members of the reserve who had been given leave from their jobs and had signed on for a specific length of time for a mission in Bosnia . 
They deserve much credit for this , because they sometimes run into problems getting their jobs back . 
Employers are more or less obliged to let them go , but when they come back , they sometimes find out someone has taken their place . 
To improve the reform we have before us , far more attention would have to be paid to members of the reserve , because they will become more and more necessary if we accept the fact that there will be fewer and fewer career soldiers . 
Consequently , any improvement that can be made to the situation for the reserve strikes us as very important , and Bill C-37 does so by improving their pension possibilities . 
There were other difficulties . 
For instance , the vesting period , which will be shorter . 
Members had to serve for 10 years to qualify for a pension . 
The minimum period for qualifying will now be two years . 
This encourages people to say , `` I will give it a try and , if it does not work , I will at least qualify for a pension after two years '' . 
Previously , members who became disheartened or left lost their pension entitlement . 
They needed 10 years of accumulated service to qualify . 
Sometimes these individuals spoke of the forces in less than complimentary terms to those around them , which might have discouraged others from joining the Canadian Forces . 
I think there is real improvement . 
As far as pension portability is concerned , this legal sounding term refers to the ability members of the armed forces now have to transfer their pensions into their registered retirement savings plans . 
They could not do that before , but now they can . 
This is encouraging to people , who think , `` Should I ever leave the forces and be entitled to a pension , I will transfer this money into another retirement plan . 
This way , I will not lose it '' . 
I feel this is one of the strengths of this bill . 
Also , with respect to pension eligibility no longer being tied to service , this will apply to reservists as well as to members of the regular force . 
Until now , a member who enlisted for five years and later decided not to re-enlist -- as I said earlier , there was a provision requiring that they serve 10 years -- lost his or her pension . 
The same was true for reservists . 
Those who left the forces , saying they had had enough , lost their entitlement . 
Today , eligibility is no longer tied to a period of service . 
A reservist will be able to say , `` I have had it with the Canadian Forces . 
I will take a break for a year or two . 
I have other obligations right now , but I would like to come back later '' . 
Even if the period of service is not continuous , it will be possible to continue accumulating pensionable service , picking up where he or she left off . 
This is an idea that would definitely be of interest to people , because it is much more flexible . 
This way , they would not be saying , after 5 or 10 years of service , `` I have no pension rights . 
That is it . 
If I re-enlist , I start at zero again . '' 
In my opinion , this eliminates a problem that goes beyond recruitment . 
Of course , the federal government cut back funding to the army in the early 1990s , so that we have dropped from an army numbering 80,000 to one numbering around 50,000 . 
As a consequence , we must now emphasize recruitment . 
What good does it do to plunge into recruiting while people are leaving by the back door , and we have no retention measures ? 
These measures before us today are retention measures , to encourage people to stay in the forces . 
Now , as for the pension , new people can be eligible after 25 years of service . 
That is another retention measure . 
It did raise a few questions when we read the bill for the first time . 
I had an excellent briefing by the Canadian Forces on the subject . 
Their people came to my office to explain what happens to those now covered by the plan , that is , those who have been in for 18 or 19 years and who were planning to leave in a year or two , that is , after 20 years , which is the current minimum . 
The question had come up : `` Are we going to tell these people , ' You cannot leave after all . 
You cannot leave in a year or two because we have changed the law . 
From now on , it will be 25 years . ' '' 
So , they told us that it would be optional for those people . 
That is very interesting , because there are people who have served 18 or 19 years in the army , and I know very well that they are keen to retire . 
They know that after 20 years they are entitled to a full pension . 
They have told me : `` We are against this Mr. Bachand . 
You cannot expect us to put off our retirement for five years . 
We have made plans : we were going to leave the Canadian Forces in a year or two '' . 
The bill makes this optional . 
Current members will have the choice of retiring after 20 or 25 years . 
It will be their choice and there will be no penalty . 
Nonetheless , a newcomer to the Canadian Forces will certainly know from the outset that he has to serve in the forces for 25 years . 
This is not a double standard . 
People have said to me , `` Claude , be careful . 
It is like a grandfather clause . 
Some will have more benefits than others '' . 
That is not the case here . 
Those who are already in the army can leave after 20 years of service or , if they wish , they can serve five additional years under the legislation . 
However , new arrivals know that it is 25 years of service . 
Consequently , when they sign their contract , they do so with full knowledge of the facts . 
It is no different than those who signed a contract 20 years ago . 
They knew at the time that in 20 years they could retire . 
Those who sign a contract today know they can retire after 25 years . 
This is also a retention measure because there are people who have served in the army for 19 or 20 years who would like to continue . 
Letting them accumulate more years of pensionable service , because they would be able to serve for five more years , would be very good because it would build up the pension fund . 
Some people like being in the army , while others like it less . 
In general , however , this ensures that everyone can be satisfied to some extent . 
This will also satisfy the fundamental needs of the Canadian Forces . 
Now , I must warn the government , because terrible things have happened with regard to this veterans ' bill . 
The minister said that he supported the adoption of amendments to the legislation and the regulations . 
Since there was not enough money , he decided to set aside measures that must be approved , debated and voted on in the House . 
In terms of veterans , the government decided to proceed through regulations . 
This means that the governor in council or cabinet will define the parameters . 
Also this bill leaves the way open for regulations . 
The government should be extremely careful here . 
When regulations are used to bypass parliamentarians , democracy is weakened . 
As MPs , we receive representations from all sorts of people , especially when they know we are our party 's critic for a given portfolio . 
Since there is a strong military presence in my riding , many service members come to seen me about issues concerning Bill C-37 before us , and veterans affairs as well . 
When they hear that people are treated differently because regulatory measures were taken instead of parliamentary or legislative measures , some of them take offence . 
A case in point concerns veterans . 
Ten thousand widows were told they would be getting a substantial benefit in the form of a veterans allowance , the veterans being their husbands who are now deceased , to allow them to keep their homes . 
They will receive money for housekeeping and groundkeeping . 
We are talking about 10,000 widows who were told that from now on and for as long as they live in their home , they will be getting this allowance , but the widows of other veterans will not . 
There is a major problem when 10,000 women are entitled to assistance and 23,000 others are not . 
I do hope this situation will be corrected . 
We in the Bloc Quebecois are working on an action plan to ensure that the 66 % of women who are widows of veterans are not discriminated against . 
A measure that does not help people who need to stay in their homes looks a bit unfair to me . 
And that is not even counting the fact that when they leave because they are no longer able to keep up their homes , they often end up in long term care . 
From then on , looking after these people is the province 's responsibility , not the federal government 's . 
And yet it is a federal jurisdiction . 
For once , when the federal government has jurisdiction , perhaps it could look after it properly instead of trying to interfere in all sorts of jurisdictions in Quebec . 
Thus , we must warn the government . 
If there are amendments to this bill , or if , in the future , there are amendments with regard to amounts of money , eligibility , or qualifying periods , they must be brought before the House in the form of a legislative amendment so that the members of Parliament can discuss them . 
That way , when we get questions from our constituents , we will be able to give them answers and we will not be at a loss . 
It was our distinct impression that all widows were going to get help , because the minister had announced on May 12 that he would be ensuring that all widows would benefit from changes for the better , but that was not so . 
Over the summer they likely realized that the bill would be a bit steep , so they settled on a figure of $ 69 million , a reallocation , rather than the total measure , which would have included all spouses and likely would have come to $ 200 million . 
The government did not have that kind of money . 
We appealed to the minister to ensure that the next budget would include enough money to provide this coverage to everyone . 
There is one condition , however : that something as important as this not be done by regulation , but rather by legislation . 
As for the bill as a whole which we have before us today , we are very pleased to see that the conditions and quality of life of those who will be retiring from the army will be improved . 
That , I think , was important . 
Not only important , but helpful for retaining people in the Forces . 
Not only will they be more interested in enlisting , but they will be more interested in making a career in the Canadian Forces because of all these measures . 
Mr. Gary Schellenberger ( Perth -- Middlesex , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is an honour and a privilege to speak today to a matter of great importance to the men and women of the Canadian armed forces and the Canadian armed forces reserve . 
The legislation has the support of members on both sides of the House precisely because it improves the standard of living of our men and women in uniform . 
I have great personal respect for the Canadian armed forces and the Canadian armed forces reserve , as I believe their personnel are national heroes . 
They undertake the defence of our freedom and the protection of our borders without concern for the obvious risks involved . 
In return , I believe we owe them the best possible heroes ' reward . 
Part of that reward is to ensure we provide them with the type and kind of equipment they need to complete their missions . 
We have an obligation to guarantee that they have the resources they need , not only to discharge their duty but to return home safely . 
That is why so many of my colleagues in the House insist that we must increase the defence budget . 
My colleague , the member for Saint John , has done everything in her power to ensure that our military is properly equipped . 
She is not alone , and I want to praise the work of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs for all the work it has done . 
The renovation of the military and reserve pension schemes is something that many would argue has been a long time coming . 
The Canadian armed forces and the Canadian armed forces reserve of the present day face many different challenges than those our military faced in the past . 
Since the September 11 attacks , our military has changed both in terms of the missions it is given and the members it must recruit . 
Any effective pension plan must reflect these changes . 
The military pension scheme must also reflect the fact that many of its recruits join up at a very young age , and that they are subjected to some of the most rigorous training imaginable . 
It is my understanding and belief that all these concerns , and more , are addressed in the legislation now under consideration by the House . 
The legislation recognizes that our armed forces reserve is being called upon to take a greater role in our national security . 
As my colleagues have said , the backbone of our military is the militia . 
This fact has not been previously recognized in the military pension scheme . 
Under the legislation , those necessary changes will be made into law . 
Many of the changes are administrative in nature but underscore the more important policy concerns that our military men and women have with the administration of their pensions . 
Clearing up this red tape will only help in making the Canadian armed forces a more attractive option for many young Canadians who might be considering a career in the military . 
As the House already knows , our military is having a difficult time recruiting the necessary number of men and women needed to handle the burden of missions now upon us . 
The September 11 attacks and subsequent war on terror attacks have had a marked effect on recruitment efforts , as patriotic young Canadians have answered the call of their country . 
However , stories about how Canadian soldiers and veterans are forced to fight with this government for the benefits that they have so clearly earned , gives them pause . 
The operational tempo , that is to say the ratio of time spent by Canadian Forces personnel in deployed missions , has increased dramatically in the same period that the number of CF personnel was in decline . 
Any businessman will tell us that when demand exceeds supply , the end result is a shortage . 
When there is a shortage in our military , then the security of the country is weakened . 
Our ability to offer assistance to the world is limited . 
Our military ends up serving longer , with fewer rotations . 
With fewer rotations the men and women of our military have less time to train here at home and less time to be with their families . 
We have just recently witnessed the very tragic and very dangerous aspect of military missions . 
Two Canadian soldiers in the prime of their lives were taken from us in Afghanistan . 
We can honour their memory and their service by improving the conditions of those they have left behind . 
My colleague from Saint John has repeatedly said that when it comes to our military we cannot play politics . 
However I do not believe it would be political for me to say that we need to improve the state of our military in light of current events . 
It would not be political because so many of my colleagues on both sides of this chamber have said the same thing . 
It would not be political when an unbiased publication , Jane 's Defence Weekly , has written that spending cuts to our defence budget have caused irreparable damage to our military . 
We have to take action now . 
We need to ensure that the military has an increased budget that remains stable in years to come . 
Stable funding is the cornerstone of an effective military , just as a stable pension is the cornerstone of personal financial security for our military men and women . 
Today I am proud to stand in support of making the changes necessary to improve the lives of those who risk their lives for us . 
Our military 's strongest asset is flesh and blood , not steel . 
Whenever we speak of national defence , we must remember that we speak of sons and daughters , brothers and sisters , mothers and fathers . 
Our goal here today is to improve the standard of living for our military personnel for years to come . 
I believe , given that task , there is no reason that we should not give it our unanimous support . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg -- Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak today , on behalf of the NDP , to Bill C-37 , an act to amend the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts . 
I am also pleased to join with members of all parties by way of indicating our support for the bill . 
I hope the bill will proceed expeditiously and that the benefits , which will accrue to members of the armed forces as a result of the bill , will come into effect as soon as possible . 
Many members have already gone into detail , including the minister , the critic for the official opposition and others , as to what all is contained in the bill , and I see no need to repeat that . 
It is important I think to highlight at least one of the changes , and that has to do with providing pension benefits to full time reservists . 
This is something that has been advocated for a long time and I am glad to see that the minister has been able to make this happen , as , I might add , he has been able to make a number of things happen since he has become the minister . 
I do not agree with the minister on everything , particularly when it comes to national missile defence -- and I might have more to say about that later -- but we have had some legislation come forward during the time of his tenure , shall we say , in which things that were long overdue are finally happening , and Bill C-50 is one of those things . 
There are still other things that could be done to make life easier for those who are concerned about our reserve forces . 
Recruitment is still a problem and retention is a problem once they are recruited . 
I am sure the minister is aware of those problems . 
I see the minister is in the House . 
Maybe afterward he could clear up something that came to my attention , because he may have an opportunity in questions and comments to say something . 
One of the rumours running through the reserves is that the program that provides some educational benefit to people joining the reserve , whereby they get help with their university education , may be cut . 
People who are in command positions within the reserve are concerned about this . 
They see this as an important recruiting tool to be able to offer young Canadians who may be considering joining the reserve . 
When I asked that question this morning , when members of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs were at DND , I was told there was no thought being given to cutting that particular program . 
It would be good if the minister could confirm that and that it be communicated to people in the reserve . 
There is no sense having rumours floating around that are unfounded , but , if they are well-founded , we would like to know that as well . 
The minister said that he wanted to make the forces , both regular and reserve , the employer of choice . 
Certainly bringing pension benefits up to par with that which is offered in the rest of the public service and the private sector would be part of that . 
The bill would go some way toward creating the context that the minister desires . 
However I certainly would agree with the official opposition critic who talked about the quality of life for our Canadian Forces members while at the same time tolerating this increase in rent . 
If we kind of take with one hand what we have given with the other , people are not stupid . 
They do not come away feeling good about it . 
If the idea is to make people in the Canadian Forces feel more appreciated than they have over the last several years , and to respond to the quality of life report and to deal with some of the things that led in the past to Canadian Forces families having to access food banks , et cetera , then I would hope that the minister would reconsider this rent increase as other things have been reconsidered . 
For instance , at one point it looked like a fait accompli that supply and other functions would be contracted out to a British company . 
I cannot remember the technical name . 
I know people in the forces called it kibbles and bits , or something like that . 
That decision was rescinded and the work has not been contracted out . 
There is room for flexibility here . 
If the minister could see the wisdom of not proceeding with this , that would be great . 
While we are on contracting out , although it is not quite relevant , I would hope that the Minister of Industry might see the wisdom of rescinding the contract to Lockheed Martin for the Canadian census . 
It gives one pause that if we can contract out the census to a big American multinational , it is a wonder we are not contracting out elements of our military to an American corporation .  We hope we will never see that day . 
Those are some of the things I wanted to put on the record . 
Other members have tried to turn this into a larger debate about defence spending . 
Of course that is appropriate to the degree that the Chair allows it . 
I certainly would not want to be the one who would try and do that given my longstanding respect for relevance . 
Others have mentioned it and were not chastised . 
I might also want to put on the record that we too abhor the delay in replacing the Sea King helicopters . 
I was here when that contract was cancelled . 
The EH-101s were first proposed by the Conservative government . 
We had concerns about that contract . 
I would hope that anyone who was here at the same time as I was would say that if we had any inkling of the fact that cancelling the EH-101 contract would mean that 10 years later we still would not be anywhere near obtaining a replacement for the Sea King helicopter , we would have said to buy the things . 
Whatever it was that was objectionable about them , in my opinion it has become far more objectionable to leave our Canadian Forces in the twilight zone that they have been in with respect to the Sea King helicopters for the past 10 years . 
This is a dangerous situation . 
It is a situation that has nothing to do with helicopters and has everything to do with Liberal politics in terms of the original cancellation , but more blameworthy is the fact that the Liberals have taken 10 years and they still have not figured out which one of their friends will benefit from the contract . 
Until the Liberals can figure that out , it is the people in the Canadian Forces who have to fly this obsolete equipment . 
That is shameful . 
At the heart of this is a very shameful reality . 
The reality is that defence contracts in this country can be held hostage to ongoing political manoeuvring of the sort that we have seen relating to the Sea King helicopters . 
It is not only with respect to helicopters that this happens , but this is one of the more glaring examples of how politics can hold up something which should have been proceeded with expeditiously . 
If the Liberals want to cancel a contract , that is fine . 
However , they have to make up their minds about what the new helicopter will be like and get them on stream and into the hands of the people who need them . 
The member from the Bloc Québécois said he could not resist the opportunity to speak highly and offer praise to the Canadian armed forces who were helping out during the ice storm in Quebec . 
I certainly welcome his remarks in that regard . 
Likewise , I want to take the opportunity to be praiseworthy of the members of the Canadian armed forces who were in Manitoba at the time of the flood in 1997 . 
They were camped out in tents in the parking lot at the East End Community Club in Transcona . 
That is where they were bivouacked . 
I had an opportunity to visit with many of them at that time . 
I certainly want to add my commendation for the work they did at that time and for the ongoing work they do with respect to catastrophes , whether they be floods , fires , ice storms or whatever the case may be . 
The minister did say in his remarks that the national missile defence system was on stream . 
What does on stream mean ? 
We have made our opposition to Canadian participation in the American proposed and American led national missile defence system very clear on a number of occasions in the House . 
It is part and parcel of what the government has always said it was against , which is the weaponization of space . 
We are disappointed that the government seems to be proceeding on this without really making it clear what it is up to . 
I would hope that members of the Alliance who seem to agree with national missile defence would agree that there is a procedural inadequacy here . 
If the government is going to participate in national missile defence , it should come before the House and make that absolutely clear . 
Perhaps it could bring forward a motion and have the House vote on it . 
It should do something which at least would nod in the direction of parliamentary participation , of parliamentary approval or disapproval of this very significant step . 
As New Democrats , our main quarrel with the Minister of National Defence at this time is national missile defence by stealth . 
First of all the government was not going to have anything to do with it , then it was discussing it , and now it is on stream . 
This is not the way these kinds of major decisions should be made . 
We certainly hope that the member for LaSalle -- Émard , who is certainly on stream to becoming the next prime minister of Canada , will make his position clear on this issue so we can have a debate with him and with those who support him about the position that he has taken . 
It is pretty obvious that the position of the new prime minister will be one of support for national missile defence because he is making noises that somehow we have to kiss and make up with Washington for our brief shining moment of independence when it came to the war in Iraq . 
This is one of the concerns that we have had and one which I notice the former minister of foreign affairs has . 
The price to be paid for our independence on the war in Iraq will be years of acquiescence , of making up , for that independence . 
It seems to us it was no coincidence that shortly after that the government began to move in the way it has on national missile defence . 
I will end there . 
Perhaps the minister will have an opportunity in questions and comments to respond to one of the things that I raised earlier in my remarks . 
Hon. John McCallum ( Minister of National Defence , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am happy to respond to the specific question raised by the hon. member regarding education . 
As he knows , I myself have spent 18 years in the field of education . 
The education advisory board met last week and is trying to put a really strong focus on the importance of education and professional development in the Canadian Forces . 
With that as a background , I am happy to confirm that there is absolutely no suggestion that the educational benefits that are currently provided for reservists are in any kind of jeopardy . 
This is not the case . 
I do not know where the rumour came from but rumours sometimes get around . 
I am telling the member unequivocally that those benefits are there to stay . 
We will try to get the word out to anybody who has doubts on this matter . 
Mrs. Betty Hinton ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask the member from Strathcona a simple question , but there is a preamble to it . 
He mentioned the floods in Manitoba , and I can certainly feel for him . 
I appreciate the fact that the military was there . 
My other colleague from the Bloc mentioned the ice storms in Quebec and I appreciate that as well . 
I found myself in the position this summer of knowing first hand just how valuable the military is in a domestic crisis . 
Military personnel were in my riding for the fires this summer and I do not know how we would have done it without them . 
I truly do appreciate them . 
The member from Strathcona and I have some philosophical differences regarding the issues of the Canadian military . 
I do think we are on side on one issue , which is that we have treated our military very poorly . 
With regard to the missile defence system which he also raised , I would only say to him that from my perspective and my point of view , I have to look at things in reality . 
We have Alaska above us and the United States below us . 
Whether or not a missile shield goes in is almost a foregone conclusion . 
Perhaps he would disagree with me , but I would like to be a part of that decision making process since I am fairly aware it is going to happen regardless . 
The question I would like to ask concerns the superannuation that we are discussing today . 
Although it is a very small step toward treating military personnel the way they deserve to be treated and honouring them for what they do for us in the country and what they do for us overseas , would the member agree that it is a step in the right direction ? 
I would like to confirm that he and I are on the same page on this and we are going to support this bill . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not want to be unkind but the hon. member should pay closer attention . 
I said right at the beginning that we supported the bill . 
Also , the name of my riding is Winnipeg -- Transcona , not Strathcona . 
Strathcona is in Edmonton . 
This is not an Alliance strategy for winning Winnipeg -- Transcona , to confuse Transcona with Strathcona . 
Seeing that the member brought this up , I would also say what the origin of the word Transcona is . 
It is not unrelated to Strathcona because the community of Transcona was created in 1909-10 when the railway shops in Transcona were built for the second transcontinental railway that was being built in our country at that time . 
Residents wondered what to call the community and it was suggested that it be a combination of transcontinental and Lord Strathcona , who was a founder of the railways . 
That is how the word Transcona came to be . 
I thank the hon. member for the opportunity to give this little history lesson on the origin of the word Transcona but remind her that Strathcona is a community in Edmonton . 
She is not the first one to make that mistake , but I thought I should speak in a way that perhaps she would never make it again . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
I heard something from somewhere in the House about relevance . 
I think we have just given it a whole new dimension . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George -- Peace River , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , earlier in debate between myself and the hon. Minister of National Defence , he referred to the fact that in his opinion the government that he represents has been very forthcoming with funds to replace equipment . 
In fact he was bragging about the $ 160 million in last year 's budget that was applied to the capital replacement program . 
I note in today 's Ottawa Sun in a story by Stephanie Rubec that our Prime Minister , who was in Kabul yesterday or the day before , criticized the military for having a never-ending wish list and for continually demanding more money . 
He is quoted as saying , `` But it is never enough . 
They all need more . 
And they all have plans for more '' . 
He went on to say that we have the best equipment , that we are better equipped than anybody else . 
Would my hon. colleague from the NDP care to comment upon yet the latest example of the Prime Minister of our country addressing an issue of the gross neglect of our military on behalf of his government ? 
The Prime Minister is basically blaming them or suggesting that they are simply crybabies , that they have this never-ending wish list when what they really need is the proper equipment to protect our young men and women when they are stationed overseas in harm 's way . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sure it is the case that the armed forces , like any other organization , have a wish list . 
It is the job of politicians to decide what on that wish list is appropriate to provide and what is not . 
When it comes to the Canadian armed forces at the moment , there are many things on that wish list for which they should never have to wish .  They should already have these things . 
As I said earlier , one thing they should already have and for which they should not have to wish is a replacement for the Sea King helicopters . 
However there are many other things one would think would be just part of something that would happen in due course . 
I have had people tell me that they have problems training people in the militia . 
Why ? 
Because they have no ammunition . 
This is not a debate about nuclear submarines .  We are talking about people having bullets , rounds , call them whatever , so that when they point down the range something comes out of the end of the barrel . 
Something is going on when people say that it would be nice to be able to train people , but they only get issued two bullets per season or something like that . 
This is the kind of thing that makes a mockery of some of the things that are sometimes said about how well we look after our armed forces . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there have been reports recently of the United States becoming so desperate to gain public support about the missile defence , or star wars program , that it has actually floated opportunities for the public to be involved . 
One suggestion that has come back , in terms of a national missile defence fund , is that the Americans use interceptor balloons to hit the missiles . 
Could the government have made different decisions about the use of tax cuts , for example , those which have gone to a select few , and instead invested more into our military to provide the rightful resources ? 
It is a matter of choices . 
Does the member feel the government has made the right choices ? 
Mr. Bill Blaikie : 
Mr. Speaker , I say to my colleague that I do not feel the government has made the right choices . 
I think it has a habit of making the wrong choices . 
However this is interesting . 
What kind of choices does the opposition make in terms of what it opposes and what it supports ? 
Many times we have heard speeches from the official opposition and from the Conservatives . 
Of course now they are now one big happy family under the tutelage of Brian Mulroney . 
It is a wonderful thing to see the Alliance members have come back under the wing of Mr. Mulroney and the elite . 
They have come crawling back with their heads hanging down saying that this is a terrible failure , that they are sorry and asking if they can come back . 
To see what has happened to the Alliance , makes the story of the prodigal son look somewhat tame . 
I do not want to get diverted . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
I know the hon. member would also want to stay within the confines of relevancy . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie : 
Mr. Speaker , the member 's question was about choices . 
The fact of the matter is those people who are constantly complaining and whining about a lack of resources for our national defence forces are the same people who do not blink an eye when there are $ 100 million in tax cuts and money goes to corporations and the wealthy in the country , money that would be much better spent on housing and other things for our armed forces . 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the member for Winnipeg -- Transcona for the history lesson on the genesis of Transcona . 
First , Bill C-37 , which is an act to amend the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act , encompasses a number of things . 
I would note that substantively the House is in support of this bill . 
However a couple of points were raised . 
I heard the comments of the Bloc Quebecois this morning on the transitional provisions with regard to those who are already under the current plan and with regard to the widows ' benefits , of which I am not sure of the details . 
I will try to find out . 
Just in summary , I would like to remind the House that the bill would make changes to the pension benefit scheme provided under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act . 
The key features of the revised scheme are : first , a reduction of the minimum period for qualifying for a pension to two years ; second , tying benefit eligibility to years of pensionable service rather than completion of a period of engagement in the Canadian Forces ; and third , the provision of an immediate pension to a person who has completed 25 years of paid service in the Canadian Forces and has at least two years of pensionable service . 
There are also some consequential amendments or adjustments to other acts as a result of these proposed changes . 
Again from the debate so far today , we certainly have broadened out the subject matter from pensions for our military and we have heard some very complimentary words about the quality of our Canadian Forces , but not from all . 
It really concerns me that in this place from time to time we tend to take advantage of the political opportunism to maybe joust on points not realizing that the families of our military are also listening to the debate . 
They are very interested in what is happening in this place as it relates to our military . 
Canadians have heard that we have not taken care of our military personnel , that we do not pay them enough . 
We do not give them enough bullets to defend themselves . 
We do not give them the trucks or equipment they need . 
We do not do this or we do not to that . 
We do not have housing . 
After it is all said and done , we have run down the military so badly . 
It was never the intent , and I do not believe it is in fact the belief of members in this place . 
There is no question -- 
Mr. James Moore : Is the member for LaSalle -- Émard going to do it ? 
Mr. Paul Szabo : Here is a Reformer who is going to throw in his two cents , but let us not forget that it was members of the Reform Party that were going to slash military spending . 
Now , mea culpa , they are back again , `` Oh , yes , we have to do this '' . 
This is politics . 
It is not the reality of the military . 
I had an opportunity in recent months to visit two of bases of our forces .  Bagotville was one and Greenwood was another . 
I want to reiterate what members of the forces said to me as a visitor who was there to learn about what it was like to be in the military and what the concerns were . 
When I was in Bagotville , I took the opportunity to meet some of the spouses of our military members . 
They did not talk about wanting more pay for their spouses ' work . 
They talked about how difficult it was to lose spouses to a six month tour of duty , to have them come back for a short period and then maybe have them reassigned for another tour of duty .  The spouses of our military members talked about the impacts on their families . 
They talked about the unfortunate increase in the levels of domestic violence within the military family . 
They talked about the impact on the children who were living on the bases . 
They talked about the fact that our military personnel got medical care on the base while their families who lived on the base did not . 
They had to go into the town to get the public health care . 
They wondered why their entire family should not be handled by the same physician . 
These are the kinds of things about which they talked . 
In Bagotville they were not complaining about housing .  They were not complaining about salary . 
When I met these families altogether , there was significant pride in the military life . 
There was significant pride in the contribution which they were making to safety and security , not only of Canada but around the world . 
There was a professionalism that most Canadians would not see and would not appreciate . 
When I was in Greenwood at the end of last summer , I was part of a military program where I lived in barracks . 
I ate with the pilots and crews . 
I did maritime patrol for a week . 
I have a new found respect for the military . 
I met people who were a variety of range in age , but to the people , the dedication , the pride , the professionalism , the need to be better at what they did was very evident across the board . 
I can remember sitting in a simulator with many of them who were training . 
The aircraft they fly on maritime patrol are capable of dropping torpedoes . 
They simulate tracking submarines and they make decision . 
The public and members of Parliament should see our military personnel in their work . 
They are not always engaged in theatre ; they are preparing for theatre . 
They are not always doing some things . 
One member dwelt on how many bullets they had . 
Quite frankly , for many of our military , the issue is the impact of six month tours of duty , extended periods of duty and what that does to put strain on the family life . 
I wanted to raise that because it is really important for us to understand that our military personnel should not be talked about as inanimate objects . 
They are people . 
They are moms and dads . 
They have children . 
They have the same concerns , the same needs and the same wants as any other Canadian , but they are in a profession , and the significance of their profession to us is not in question . 
The issue is that they are there by their choosing , because of their pride , their dedication to their work , their professionalism and military service is what they want to do . 
There is no question that there are cases where people have not been able to stay in their positions . 
Retention of military personnel has been a problem . 
Recruitment from time to time has been a problem . 
I do not believe it helps our cause to continue to treat military personnel as inanimate objects . 
The military is made up of human beings . 
They are heroes . 
They are Canadians . 
I would hope , as the debate continues in this place , that in addition to maybe mentioning a couple of things about the bill , because the bill is pretty important , that we do in fact deal with this subject with a sensitivity which takes into account the fact families are listening to what their parliamentarians are saying about people in military life . 
They do not live in squalor . 
They do not live in poverty . 
They do not live without the benefits they are entitled to receive . 
The bill does enhance benefits . 
One of the Bloc members raised an issue about transitional provisions , that if people had planned to leave after 20 years and they had 18 years or 19 years in the military , this would cause them some problems . 
The member did not say , which he should have , that members under the transitional provisions would have an opportunity to stay under the existing plan and would start to collect their pensions after 20 years . 
They would not have to wait 25 years , as the members said . 
Mathematically , if they stayed for an additional 5 years and got up to 25 , and went under the new system , obviously their pension would be better . 
One thing is for sure under this bill . 
No pensioner from the military would be worse off with this bill . 
Every pensioner from the military in fact would be better off as a consequence of this bill . 
For that reason alone , I am sure members in this place will be supporting Bill C-37 . 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton -- Melville , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member who just spoke said that the reform party would slash military spending . 
These off-handed comments diminish credibility when they are not true . 
I want the member to be honest and cite one example from the debates in this House , or our policies , where we have ever advocated that . 
We have always defended the military , and we always will . 
Our military is essential to our sovereignty as a nation . 
Our military is essential for the respect other nations will have for Canada . 
Our military is essential to the well-being of our nation in many other ways . 
I have been here since 1993 and I know that the men and women in the military have been a priority for us , even when the budget deficit was a huge deficit . 
I would like the member to stand and give me one example when we have ever advocated cutting the budget of the military . 
Mr. Paul Szabo : 
Mr. Speaker , maybe the member did not look at his own platform when he ran in 1993 . 
If he were to look back at the platform document for the reform party , he would see . 
I will agree with the member that we should constantly be vigilant about supporting our military for the respect that it has earned , not only in Canada but also abroad . 
In recent years , it has not been so much peacekeeping as it has been peacemaking . 
There is a transitory thing going on here , in terms of the military , particularly as it relates to post 9/11 incidents . 
This is not the place , nor the time , for anybody in this place , quite frankly , to be describing the military as some sort of leper . 
Our military has a great tradition . 
It has great support in this place , on all sides I believe . 
I would hope that all members would simply use the sensitivity that I am sure they have when they are speaking about the heroes in our Canadian military . 
Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have listened to the comments from the Liberal member . 
I held the portfolio of defence critic for some 10 years and over that time I had the opportunity to observe what has happened to our military . 
Forced changes were placed upon the military due to dramatic cutbacks in budget of somewhere in the neighbourhood of 25 % or 26 % . 
Of all the departments in Ottawa , the Liberals chopped the military the most , right to the bone . 
Why ? 
Because they knew they could get away with it . 
Who was going to object ? 
They were not telling the truth to the people in this country . 
We in opposition party were vigilant in pointing that out to Canadians right from the very onset . 
We sat in opposition . 
We did not chop that budget .  The government did . 
It put the military in the position that it is presently in . 
I have a question for the member from Mississauga . 
If he believes that this party was not vigilant , what does he call his own party ? 
The Liberals are downright obnoxious and untrustworthy when it comes to looking after our military men and women . 
Mr. Paul Szabo : 
Mr. Speaker , in my own direct experience with the military at Bagotville , at Greenwood in Nova Scotia , and indeed some of the senior officers who I have met here , I have never , ever heard what the member has said from them . 
I believe that I will accept the representations of the military directly , the men and women and the leadership of the military , that they have never , ever said such things about the government 's actions with regard to the military . 
The member knows that the base budget of the military is now up to $ 800 million . 
Even the minister who spoke here today was complimented by the critic of the official opposition for being here and for taking the steps he has taken with regard to the Sea King helicopters and a number of other issues like -- 
The Deputy Speaker : 
Order , please . 
We will now proceed to statements by members . 
The hon. member for Hillsborough . 
STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
Hurricane Juan 
Mr. Shawn Murphy ( Hillsborough , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on Monday September 29 , at 3 a.m. , the most devastating storm to hit Prince Edward Island in 40 years slammed into the central part of the province uprooting trees and cutting off power to most residents . 
I rise today to express the gratitude of this House and the gratitude of all Islanders to the emergency workers whose tireless effort restored power and order to the province after hurricane Juan . 
Within a short time , Charlottetown city employees , Maritime Electric staff and other emergency workers began the difficult task of cleaning up the mess . 
They worked so efficiently , despite the fact that many roads had been blocked by trees in the early morning , that 83 % of island residents were able to get to the polls and cast their vote in the provincial election held that day . 
On behalf of all Islanders , I want to thank all emergency crew workers for their tireless and dedicated service in the hours , days and weeks following hurricane Juan . 
2010 Winter Olympics 
Mr. Andy Burton ( Skeena , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the quest for a 2010 Winter Olympics mascot is underway and I want to assist in that task . 
In the Skeena riding region of northwestern British Columbia , there exists a rare species of black bear called the kermode . 
This bear , known as muks-kum-ol by the Tsimshian people , is not an albino but actually a genetic white colour phase of the black bear . 
Found only in northwestern B.C. , this animal would make a perfect mascot for the Vancouver/Whistler winter games . 
What better promotion for an area of B.C. that deserves recognition and what better worldwide recognition for the Olympics than an animal as a mascot that is totally unique to B.C. ? 
I would urge those involved in the decision to choose our white/black bear as a proud mascot for the world stage in the years culminating at Vancouver/Whistler in 2010 . 
Folkloriques de Tadoussac 
Mr. Christian Jobin ( Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I was extremely pleased , on behalf of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services and minister responsible for Communication Canada , to take part in the 4th annual Folkloriques de Tadoussac festival , which ran from October 9 to 13 . 
This five day music fest was attended by francophones from all across Canada . 
From Prince Edward Island to Ontario , francophone folklore is alive and well . 
For the first time this year , the beautiful city of Tadoussac and the Folkloriques were proud to welcome Louisiana . 
The Folkloriques de Tadoussac festival attracted over 4,500 people this year , 1,000 more than last year , drawn by the city 's splendid scenery and the warm hospitality of its inhabitants . 
As a member of the House of Commons , I am proud to have been associated with the success of such an amazing event . 
Thanks to the Folkloriques de Tadoussac for such a great event . 
Cattle Producers 
Mr. Guy St-Julien ( Abitibi -- Baie-James -- Nunavik , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the cattle producers in Abitibi-Témiscamingue will have lost over $ 8 million in 2003 , following the detection of a lone case of mad cow disease in western Canada . 
On October 17 , I met with farmers in Val-d'Or . 
Cattle farmers in our vast region are still experiencing a significant shortfall related to this Canadian crisis , because they have not yet been compensated for their cull cattle . 
The financial assistance announced by the governments of Quebec and Canada is not sufficient to cover all the losses suffered by these businesses . 
We must respect the farmers of Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Canada , and heed their demands . 
We must take immediate action so they can obtain the financial assistance they need to survive . 
Governor General 's Awards 
Mr. Larry Bagnell ( Yukon , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Governor General 's awards in commemoration of the Persons Case have been celebrated every October since 1979 in honour of a group of outstanding Canadians known as the Famous Five . 
Emily Murphy , Louise McKinney , Nellie McClung , Henrietta Muir Edwards , and Irene Parlby fought to ensure women were recognized as `` persons '' and could therefore sit in the Senate . 
Their efforts led to the monumental Persons Case decision in 1929 . 
Each year , five women and one youth are recognized for embodying the dedication and determination of the Famous Five . 
The recipients are chosen based on their work to advance the cause of equality for women , for their leadership , and for their wholehearted commitment to improving the quality of life for women in Canada . 
It is with great pride that I rise to congratulate the six women who have been awarded the 2003 Governor General 's awards in commemoration of the Persons Case . 
The recipients are Nicole Demers of Laval , Quebec ; Eira `` Babs '' Friesen of Winnipeg , Manitoba ; Joyce Sandra Hayden of Whitehorse , Yukon ; Jayanti Negi of Edmonton , Alberta ; Marilou McPhedran of Toronto , Ontario ; and Jennifer Hustwitt of Waterloo , Ontario , is the recipient of the youth award . 
These six women will be celebrated during Women 's History Month along with the Famous Five and other outstanding women for the difference they have made . 
Bertram Brockhouse 
Mrs. Cheryl Gallant ( Renfrew -- Nipissing -- Pembroke , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my privilege to rise and pay tribute to Dr. Bertram Brockhouse who recently passed away . 
In 1994 Dr. Brockhouse shared the Nobel prize in physics for groundbreaking discoveries he made between 1950 and 1962 in the physics of solids using neutrons from Chalk River 's NRX and NRU reactors . 
Born in Alberta , and educated in British Columbia and Ontario , he is the only Canadian Nobel laureate of 14 Canadian recipients of the Nobel prize who was born , educated and completed his life 's work in Canada . 
In the process of his discoveries he developed the triple axis spectrometer , which is still used today . 
He was the first to measure the energy versus momentum relationship for lattice waves in crystals , liquids and magnetic materials . 
In fitting recognition of a lifetime of achievements , I would propose that we name the yet to be federally funded Canadian neutron facility in honour of this great Canadian . 
Nicole Demers 
Ms. Carole-Marie Allard ( Laval East , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my great pleasure to announce in this House the honour that was bestowed this morning upon a citizen of Laval , Nicole Demers . 
She and five other Canadians received the 2003 Governor General 's Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case . 
This award honours women who contribute greatly to the advancement of equality for girls and women and , in doing so , enrich their communities . 
Everyone in Laval knows Nicole Demers . 
I would say that Nicole is a genuine person and that this award suits her to a tee . 
She is an outstanding listener and has devoted her entire life to enhancing the well-being of those around her . 
She is the eldest of six children and wanted to become a missionary . 
This speaks volumes about the compassion of this woman , who currently runs the Fondation Vivre Chez Soi , which provides assistance to seniors and people with decreasing independence . 
On behalf of myself and everyone in Laval , I want to congratulate Nicole and let her know how proud we are that she is one of us and proud of the honour which , thanks to her , reflects on Laval and all of Quebec . 
Nicole Demers 
Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral ( Laval Centre , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this morning , as part of the commemoration of the celebrated persons case , six women were honoured for their exceptional dedication to promoting equality for women . 
Since 1979 , a number of Quebec women have been honoured with this award : Françoise David , Vera Danyluk , Alice Girard , Thérèse Casgrain , to name but a few .  Joining their ranks today is Nicole Demers , whom it is an honour and a pleasure to congratulate today . 
Nicole Demers , a Quebecker through and through , holds the conviction that only commitment and determination will bring about change .  Whether as a union activist or an administrator , she has worked for equity and justice for those women who are the most vulnerable . 
A strong presence in the Laval community with a particular concern for the quality of life of seniors , she has focused her energies on the founding of Fondation Vivre Chez Soi , which helps seniors remain in their own homes . 
Her unflagging energy and courage are admired by all those who have come in contact with her . 
I wish to commend , congratulate and thank Nicole on their behalf . 
Day for the Elimination of Poverty 
Ms. Marlene Catterall ( Ottawa West -- Nepean , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last Friday was the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Poverty . 
Here in Ottawa , on the lawn of city hall , the Poverty Awareness Week Committee and the Dorothy Award Working Group held the dedication of the Dorothy O'Connell Monument for Anti-Poverty Activism . 
This monument will be a tribute to Dorothy , a long time activist dedicated to eliminating poverty , and to the many others who have dedicated themselves to this objective , but it is also a reminder that poverty in our communities hurts us all , and that all of us may be one job , one divorce , one tragic accident , or one disability away from poverty . 
To combat poverty is a mission for all of us . 
Foreign Affairs 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this week the Prime Minister has chosen to visit communist China for a fourth time , but he cannot find even a few hours to touch down in Japan to press for an end to that country 's unfair ban on Canadian beef exports even though Japan is the linchpin to opening the U.S. border to our $ 6 billion in Canadian beef exports . 
The Prime Minister will also maintain his flawless record of doing and saying nothing that might offend his Chinese communist pals , like speaking in favour of human rights and democracy or calling for negotiations with the Dalai Lama to save Tibet from Beijing 's campaign of cultural genocide . 
Could this betrayal of values and interests have anything to do with the Prime Minister 's close ties with his friends and relatives in Power Corp. , which has an enormous stake in the PRC ? 
Could it be that the Prime Minister will enjoy large fees as a Power Corp. director and consultant after his retirement ? 
And will anything change under new management , given that Power Corp. has been the biggest sponsor of the incoming prime minister 's career ? 
It is time to end the influence of Liberal corporate cronyism on our foreign policy and to start putting Canadian values and interests first . 
Foreign Affairs 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul 's , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise in the House today to add my opposition to that of many people in Canada and around the world to the anti-Semitic comments made by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed this past Thursday . 
I wish to add my voice to that of the Canadian government in condemning Mr. Mahathir 's remarks in the strongest possible way . 
The Canadian foreign affairs minister has responded by saying that `` we make it clear to our own citizens that we totally reject both the premise and the spirit of where this is coming from '' . 
We in Canada are proud of moving our multicultural agenda from one of diversity and tolerance to one of genuine respect . 
The future of this tiny planet requires an acknowledgement that the opportunity of all peoples is not a zero-sum game . 
The rise of anti-Semitism and the incitement of hatred put the security of the world at risk . 
As we celebrate the recipients of the Persons Day Award , we want to thank them for the leadership they have given us in always speaking out against a lack of equality , particularly Marilou McPhedran , a citizen of St. Paul 's . 
Bovine Beauty 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland -- Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , even though the Government of Canada has been slow to respond to hurricane Juan , BMO Nesbitt Burns in Halifax acted quickly to develop a fundraiser to assist farmers devastated by this terrible storm . 
Called `` Project Bovine Beauty '' , this fundraiser will accept donations at several levels and , in return , the cows themselves will provide an autographed photograph and a tax receipt . 
Some of the categories of contribution include maidens of the milking parlour , ladies in waiting , working girls at their best , and queen of the herd . 
Co-sponsors of Project Bovine Beauty include the Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture , the Rotary Club of Halifax Northwest , and Ron Ford , at the printer . 
Contributions can be made at any BMO Nesbitt Burns office , or people can check out the BMO Nesbitt Burns website for details . 
All funds go to farmers and their families , who have lost so much . 
I wish to say congratulations to BMO . 
Sophie Ducharme and Jenny Demers 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint-Jean , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today I am pleased to welcome to the Hill two students from a school in my riding , École Beaulieu . 
Sophie Ducharme and Jenny Demers are here along with Mrs. Desjardins , who is Sophie 's mother . 
These two are in a specialized entrepreneurship program , taking regular classes in the mornings and working on a project of special interest to them the rest of the time . 
Both want to be lawyers , so they have chosen to explore this through internships in the legal world . 
These two , and the seven others in the program , are under the daily supervision of Hélène Du Perron . 
Their projects are very wide-ranging : nutrition , fashion , veterinary medicine , police work , and even literature . 
I wish these two young ladies and their colleagues the best of luck in their studies and in their future careers . 
Foreign Affairs 
Ms. Anita Neville ( Winnipeg South Centre , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I too want to add my comments to those made about the remarks of the prime minister of Malaysia and his perceptions of the worldwide Jewish community . 
Comments in his speech were blatantly anti-Semitic , highly inflammatory and unequivocally false .  To say they add nothing toward the peace process in the Middle East or the war on terrorism is self-evident . 
His references to Jewish power and influence were hurtful and unhelpful . 
That his remarks were applauded by the Muslim leadership in attendance at the conference speaks to the ever-present fears of the Jewish people . 
His language was shocking and only furthers racist hatred , and his subsequent unwillingness to acknowledge his remarks as such is even more appalling . 
Malaysia is on record as being a critic of the State of Israel . 
To extend this criticism to Jewish people because of faith and personal traits is totally unacceptable . 
My hope is that Muslim leaders in this country and throughout the world will speak out and deplore this bigotry and hatred for what it is . 
Preaching racism and hatred by anyone against anyone cannot go unchallenged . 
New Democratic Party 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is rutting season and , all over Canada 's great hinterland , dominant alpha males are running roughshod over their weaker , submissive rivals . 
Here in Ottawa , the once proud Progressive Conservative Party has been so overwhelmed by a political animal with a bigger rack that it is ready to give up everything even remotely progressive about itself , even its name . 
Between the Liberals selecting the most right wing leader in their party 's history and the Tories now the willing supplicants of the regressive conservatives , where are Canadians to look for truly progressive leadership ? 
Thankfully , the NDP stands proud and unwavering as the vanguard of progressive thought in this country . 
Canadians can rest assured that the NDP stands in defence of Canadian progressive values and in defence of progressive programs and institutions that define Canada as a sovereign , progressive nation . 
Excellence in Education 
Ms. Judy Sgro ( York West , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this year St. Simon Catholic School in my riding of York West is celebrating 25 years of outstanding public education . 
I am delighted to have this opportunity to pay tribute to the school board , the teachers , the students , and the parents on this special anniversary . 
St. Simon Catholic School has been nurturing , motivating and encouraging students for 25 years . 
Its motto , `` Rooted in the past .. Branches to the Future '' , epitomizes the school philosophy that traditions and history are important links to future opportunities , achievement and success . 
We all know that getting a good start in life through early learning and education is the key to a balanced , successful adult and a healthy society . 
Our education system is one of the best in the world and we in the House can all be proud of the excellent work that is being done in our schools across the country . 
I ask members to please join me in congratulating St. Simon Catholic School on its 25th anniversary and in saying thanks to all our schools , which do a remarkable job of teaching our children to reach their potential . 
Child Pornography 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , following the B.C. court decision in the case of John Robin Sharpe , `` artistic merit '' was replaced with `` public good '' instead of all defences for production and possession of child pornography being eliminated . 
Police forces across the country have had enough problems when it comes to arresting and convicting child pornographers . 
Now , each piece of pornography has to be examined to make sure that it is not for the public good . 
This is complex , labour intensive and expensive . 
The Toronto police have confiscated pornographic material from over 800 people in the last year , but to date only 65 cases have been taken to court . 
Canada needs a strategic national response to the growing problem of child exploitation and the Internet , better funding , specialized training for police , and computer technology that is up to date . 
We are falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to fighting this horrific crime against children . 
This is a growing problem , spilling out into our rural areas , and it is not being addressed by this government , especially through Bill C-20 . 
Let us join together and stamp out child pornography . 
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
Auditor General 's Report 
Mr. Stephen Harper ( Leader of the Opposition , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we learned this past weekend that the Auditor General 's report will be a scathing indictment of 10 years of mismanagement , incompetence and corruption by the Liberal government . 
What we are also learning , once again , is that the Liberals , apparently , want to prorogue the House . 
They want to run out of town , get out of town just one step ahead of the sheriff . 
Is the Liberal government committed to staying here as planned throughout the month of November so that it can be held accountable in the House for its actions ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first , we ought to congratulate and acknowledge the fact that the Leader of the Opposition seems to have engineered the takeover of a once great political party . 
We look forward to seeing how he goes about selling his views on Confederation and regional economic development in all those parts of the country where the PC Party have had faithful adherence over the years . 
As to his question , I do not think there is any need for us to talk on a draft leaked report . 
As is the case with Auditor Generals ' reports , we know that departments have the opportunity to respond , and they will do so before the report becomes final . 
Mr. Stephen Harper ( Leader of the Opposition , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me be clear . 
We are entering into a partnership for Canadians , something the Prime Minister and the next Liberal leader were incapable of doing . 
The Auditor General will report that the government bent the rules in its own interest : Challenger jets for the Prime Minister instead of new helicopters and new equipment for military personnel ; federal funds to Liberal friends through advertising contracts instead of federal funds to health care and the other needs of Canadians . 
The Prime Minister approved the deal .  The former finance minister signed all the cheques . 
Now is it true that the government will prorogue the House so that it will not be held accountable for its shameful record ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not know what kind of partnership they put together but over the last 10 years , not only has the disunited right had 10 leaders , but the official opposition itself has had three different names . 
We will see what comes . 
Before we start to get into the details of a possible Auditor General 's report , I think we should give the departments , which may be mentioned in any report that is being prepared by the Auditor General , the normal right to respond before that report becomes a final document . 
Mr. Stephen Harper ( Leader of the Opposition , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , of course no leader over here is being driven out of town by his own party . 
Some hon. members : Oh , oh . 
The Speaker : 
Order , please . 
It would be helpful if hon. members would confine their remarks to the questions instead of a sort of general brouhaha . 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition has the floor and we will want to hear his question . 
Mr. Stephen Harper : 
We seem to have struck some sensitive chords over there on the other side . 
Mr. Speaker , there are already leaks concerning the Auditor General 's report . 
The Prime Minister approved these agreements , and the new Liberal leader signed the contracts . 
The report will reveal the Liberal legacy : 10 years of mismanagement and corruption . 
Will the government agree to change the rules to ensure that this report is tabled , even if this House is not sitting ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , they ran the last two leaders they had out of town and now they are joining with another party . 
I guess they will run this leader out of town as well . 
Clearly , there is no report . 
Perhaps there will be a report prepared by the Auditor General , but any department mentioned in reports should have an opportunity to respond . 
We cannot discuss something that is at the draft stage . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou -- Antigonish -- Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , an amazing thing happened -- 
Some hon. members : Oh , oh . 
The Speaker : 
Order , please . 
I remind hon. members that we are wasting time . 
We are not going to get through the list of questions if there is this much noise greeting everyone who stands up to ask a question today . 
I know there is a lot of enthusiasm in the House and there have been many political developments of interest to all hon. members but we need some order if we are going to have questions and responses . 
The hon. member for Pictou -- Antigonish -- Guysborough . 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
Mr. Speaker , an amazing thing happened on March 28 , 2002 . 
Against the advice of his own officials , the Prime Minister demanded two new luxury jets . 
The requisition order and the contract were signed and DND took delivery of the aircraft . 
All of this was done , incredibly , in one day at a cost of $ 100 million . 
The Auditor General now wants to tell Canadians the real story behind that unprecedented purchase and other examples of government waste and mismanagement . 
Will the Prime Minister amend the Auditor General Act to allow her to present her report , even if the House of Commons shuts down early , as is planned ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we all know what the signature of the hon. member is worth on a document , ostensibly one that is serious . 
There is nothing new in these allegations . 
We have debated this in the House before . 
We think that Canadian ministers should fly in planes that are made by Canadian workers and that we need to showcase them to the world . 
Let us wait and see what the Auditor General 's report really does have to say . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou -- Antigonish -- Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I can tell by the look in the Deputy Prime Minister 's eyes that he and his Liberal colleagues are united in fright . 
It took eight hours to buy two planes for the Prime Minister : eight hours , 10 years and no decision on Sea King helicopters . 
What a shocking , self-serving , disgraceful abuse of public office . 
Will the Prime Minister amend the Auditor General Act to allow her to present her report if Parliament shuts early , or is the Prime Minister so obsessed with saddling his replacement with this scandal that he will hold back on the truth ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I recognize that rhetoric . 
It is what the Reform Party used to say about the PC Party only a few weeks ago . 
Let us just see how convenient this marriage turns out to be . 
We have an Auditor General with the right to file a report . 
She prepares a draft report and submits it to departments so they can make their comments and respond to it before her report becomes final . 
Let us see what her final report has to say . 
The Speaker : 
Order please . 
It is very difficult to hear the questions and answers . 
The Chair cannot hear them , and remarks could be made which are out of order . 
The hon. member for Laurier -- Sainte-Marie . 
Foundations 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier -- Sainte-Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last May , the Standing Committee on Public Accounts recommended that all the foundations established by the government be subject to the Auditor General 's scrutiny and the Access to Information Act . 
However , the President of the Treasury Board has just rejected this recommendation . 
With the Minister of Public Works and Government Services , the right hand man of the future prime minister , wanting to abolish the sponsorship program to save face , will the minister admit that her refusal is giving the government the means to continue allocating public funds to independent foundations which are not controlled by Parliament ? 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , foundations are directly accountable to Parliament through the ministers , in the usual manner , by means of reports which are tabled in Parliament by each of the departments . 
With regard to the funding agreements reached with each foundation , it is possible to require evaluation and compliance reports . 
The annual reports of foundations established by statute are tabled directly in the House . 
Parliamentarians , therefore , have all the necessary tools at their disposal . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier -- Sainte-Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in other words , the minister is saying that the committee was wrong . 
However , the committee looked at the facts , including the Auditor General 's report , which shows that crown corporations were used to launder public funds during the sponsorship scandal . 
However , these crown corporations are not often subject to the Auditor General 's scrutiny or the Access to Information Act , as is also the case with numerous foundations . 
It is all very well for the future prime minister to say he wants to abolish the sponsorship program , but is the minister not ensuring that in future it will be the foundations which will benefit the friends of the party with no control by parliament , as was usually the case -- 
The Speaker : 
The hon. President of the Treasury Board . 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will not comment on leaks relating to an incomplete report that has yet to be tabled in the House . 
That said , some foundations were established by statute . 
Therefore , Parliament approved the establishment of the majority , over 80 % of all amounts allocated to the foundations . 
Each board is responsible for appointing an auditor , and each audit is submitted to the minister who must report directly to Parliament . 
Therefore , parliamentarians have an opportunity to ask questions relating to the different foundations . 
Mr. Robert Lanctôt ( Châteauguay , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the list of heads of crown corporations shows us that these people are all well-known Liberals , involved at the highest levels : André Ouellet at Canada Post , Jean Pelletier at Via Rail and Michel Vennat at the Business Development Bank of Canada . 
In the same vein , will the government admit that the foundations created by the former finance minister , which are also controlled by Liberals , will become new vehicles for the government to get itself into another scandal like that involving sponsorships ? 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , once again , with respect to most of the foundations -- the largest ones , such as the Canada Foundation for Innovation , were even created by legislation -- the benefits and assistance provided to researchers across the country are visible . 
I think most hon. members realize clearly the positive impact they can have . 
That said , at any time we can ask the representatives , the heads of the foundations , as well as the responsible minister , to appear before parliamentary committees and to answer questions concerning their foundation . 
Mr. Robert Lanctôt ( Châteauguay , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is odd to hear about this kind of audit . 
There is some $ 6.5 billion not yet spent by these foundations . 
By sheltering the foundations from the provisions of the Access to Information Act , the government is arming itself with the tools to create another scandal , like the sponsorship scandal , more modern tools created by the person who will soon become prime minister . 
Are we to understand that what awaits us is a new prime minister , with new tools , but with the same results at the end of the day ? 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I believe that Canadians can see the results every day , whether from the Canada Foundation for Innovation or the millennium scholarships , which help hundreds and hundreds of Canadian students , or Genome Canada , which supports research in the field of genomics . 
All of these grants for research are important for the whole country and most Canadians will benefit from them . 
Auditor General 's Report 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Auditor General is an independent watchdog of government spending . 
Here is what she found out about the $ 100 million purchase of luxury jets for the cabinet . 
First off , the jets were not needed ; second , the money was spent suspiciously right at year end ; and finally , there was no tendering of the contract . 
Why did the former finance minister sign the cheques for this deal when it was so flawed and the priority so low ? 
Hon. John McCallum ( Minister of National Defence , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not quite sure where the hon. member got those quotes because it is my understanding the report of the Auditor General has yet to be released . 
It would be very difficult for me to comment on a report that I have not read because it has not been released . 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it has been leaked so that every journalist in the country knows what is in it . 
The executive jets for Liberal cabinet ministers are new and flying 99 % of the time . 
Sea Kings are old and spend much too much time on the ground for repairs . 
My question stands . 
Why are the priorities of the next Liberal leader so mixed up that he would sign off on this flawed process when the priority was so low ? 
Hon. John McCallum ( Minister of National Defence , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since the hon. member mentioned Sea Kings , I might mention that my colleague , the Minister of Public Works and Government Services , and I have been working diligently to assure the fastest possible delivery of the new helicopter . 
Indeed , just as that great economist Adam Smith once said , `` It is not from the benevolence of the butcher .. or the baker , that we expect our dinner '' , so too is it not to the benevolence of the helicopter companies that we will seek speedy delivery ? 
That is why my colleague and I are in the process of designing penalties for slow delivery and bonuses for fast delivery , which go to the bottom line -- 
The Speaker : 
The hon. member for Winnipeg -- Transcona . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg -- Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the respective memberships of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party will be interested to know that far from waiting to see what they thought of the matter , the union has been consummated on the floor of the House of Commons here in question period before they even get to say anything . 
In the end , what is the difference between a marriage of convenience and a flag of convenience ? 
Why does the right not go the whole way , sign up with the member for LaSalle -- Émard and get it over with . 
We will have one big united right in this country with only the NDP standing up for what counts ? 
I want to ask the minister -- 
The Speaker : 
The hon. member has run out of time . 
We are in question period , not S. O. 31s . 
The hon. member for Winnipeg -- Transcona may have a supplementary question . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to ask the government House leader , does he not think the people of Canada are entitled to hear what the Auditor General has to say in a timely way when she is supposed to report ? 
Will he guarantee that the House will live up to the calendar that it is bound by ? 
Will he tell us that the House will be sitting and if it is not sitting , will he at least be honest and tell us we are not sitting so we can do something about it ? 
Hon. Don Boudria ( Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is getting a little agitated . 
He should know that the Auditor General can report four times a year . 
We are into that quarter . 
There is no one that stops the Auditor General from reporting and from tabling her report before the House of Commons . 
Insofar as the parliamentary calendar is concerned , that is published on a weekly basis . 
His seatmate attends regularly and does an excellent job at the House leaders meeting . 
He should have a little bit more confidence in her than that . 
Ethics 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government pays little attention to ethics . 
It seems clear that the ethics counsellor makes up rules on the fly and whether a member chooses to obey those rules or not is optional . 
The ethics counsellor instructed the Minister of Industry to remove himself from dealings with the Irving family and the Minister of Industry blatantly refused . 
Will the Deputy Prime Minister explain to the House why his ethics standards are optional ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I sought the advice of the ethics counsellor .  I followed his advice absolutely . 
I am satisfied that in every respect I complied with the direction of the ethics counsellor by not involving myself in any decisions that directly affected the interests of the Irving companies . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Industry accepted gifts from the Irving family well over the $ 200 limit . 
Not only did the member accept the gift , he delayed in reporting the gift and he ignored instructions from the ethics counsellor to remove himself from decisions affecting the Irving empire . 
The Minister of Public Works did exactly the same thing and was forced to resign . 
Maybe the Minister of Industry could explain the double standard . 
I would like to hear his explanation . 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I made full disclosure to the ethics counsellor with respect to the matter in question . 
The ethics counsellor provided me with advice . 
I took that advice and followed it to the letter . 
I excluded myself from decisions that directly involved the interests of the Irving companies . 
That was the advice and I followed it . 
St. Lawrence Seaway 
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont -- Petite-Patrie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last June , the federal government refused to even do a study of dredging and widening the St. Lawrence Seaway in order to allow large vessels to move from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean . 
Now , only a few months later , we learn the government is in favour of the project . 
What happened in the last four months to prompt this total about-face by the federal government as far as the seaway is concerned ? 
Hon. David Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the U.S. government has decided to examine the possibility of expanding the St. Lawrence Seaway . 
We find this of interest , but we require studies before undertaking expansion . 
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont -- Petite-Patrie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since his colleague , the Minister of Transport , has given support in principle to the project , can the Minister of Environment tell us whether he has given his OK to the St. Lawrence Seaway dredging and widening project , knowing what a negative environmental impact it will have on the St. Lawrence ? 
What new information does he have at his disposal ? 
Hon. David Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is why we are examining the situation . 
We need to determine whether there will be any environmental problems . 
Ethics 
Mr. James Rajotte ( Edmonton Southwest , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the industry minister has been caught in a clear conflict of interest . 
In July 2001 he went on a fishing trip in an executive jet paid for by the Irving family . 
In June 2003 the federal government awarded an Irving owned company $ 55 million to help redevelop their unused shipyard , something the minister had been lobbying for since May 2002 . 
This is a clear conflict of interest . 
Will the minister do the honourable thing today and resign as the industry minister ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , after I became Minister of Industry , because of the nature of the files I was involved in , I went to see the ethics counsellor . 
I made full disclosure of the visit to the Irving family . 
I took his advice to withdraw from , in particular the matter referred to by the member . 
I did withdraw from it .  It was handled entirely by the members of government . 
It was decided by the members of government . 
It was eventually included in the budget this year without my knowledge in advance . 
I have complied with the advice of the ethics counsellor to remove myself from that and other matters that directly relate to the Irving businesses . 
Mr. James Rajotte ( Edmonton Southwest , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the industry minister was specifically directed by the ethics counsellor not to involve himself in any decisions involved with the Irvings . 
The $ 55 million fund was announced during that blackout period . 
In addition , in November 2002 the vice-chairman of Irving Shipbuilding was appointed by Industry Canada to the shipbuilding and industrial marine advisory committee . 
This was also done during the blackout period put forward by the ethics counsellor . 
Clearly the minister is in a conflict of interest and was involved during the blackout period . 
Again I ask the minister , will he do the honourable thing and resign today ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member is not listening to the response . 
After I got the advice of the ethics counsellor , I withdrew from the matter . 
It may have been decided during the blackout period , but not with my involvement . 
I was out of the matter . 
It was decided by others . 
With respect to the advisory council , 30 volunteers from around the country donate their time and their expenses to come to meetings twice a year to talk about policy for shipbuilding in Canada . 
A representative of the Irving companies was included in that 30 and he took part . 
That is hardly a conflict of interest involving the pecuniary advantage of the Irving company . 
Agriculture 
Mr. Sébastien Gagnon ( Lac-Saint-Jean -- Saguenay , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with respect to the cull cattle issue , the Quebec minister of agriculture says that the federal government must make an effort and she is asking for help in convincing the federal government to do its share . 
Given that 40 % of dairy cows are in Quebec , several farms are literally going bankrupt and the Government of Quebec is asking the federal government to do its share , does the Minister of Agriculture intend to follow up on the requests made by the minister and the farmers ? 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have been having meetings for a number of weeks of now , including discussions with provincial ministers , the Canadian Cattlemen 's Association and the Dairy Farmers of Canada . 
We have been discussing with them the concerns we all have with the culled cow situation in Canada and the development of markets and ways in which we can work with the provinces and the industry to alleviate the financial pressure that has been caused by BSE . 
I can tell the hon. member we will continue those discussions with the provinces and the industry . 
Mr. Sébastien Gagnon ( Lac-Saint-Jean -- Saguenay , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the new agricultural policy framework includes less money for cattle producers than the special program did last summer . 
How can the federal government wash its hands of its responsibilities to farmers who are going bankrupt , when it collects 50 % of our taxes ? 
If it collects our taxes , it has to assume the responsibilities that come with it . 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Canadian Federation of Agriculture asked for a third party study of the new business risk management program . 
The first vice-president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture is also the president of the UPA . 
We responded to that and the report that came back in June of this year said very clearly that the new business risk management proposal and program for Canadian producers is better than the programs that were there in the past . 
I do not know why the hon. member is complaining when we are making improvements to support the farmers rather than making other changes . 
Ethics 
Mr. Leon Benoit ( Lakeland , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the industry minister broke the law by accepting from Irving Shipbuilding a gift which was well over the $ 200 limit . 
The minister then pressured the cabinet to give that same company millions of dollars in taxpayers ' money . 
When the current House leader got caught doing the same thing , he lost his job . 
Will the current minister , now that he has been caught , hold himself to that same standard and resign ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have made clear that I made full disclosure to the ethics counsellor and by that time had not involved myself in the decision affecting the Irving companies . 
The ethics counsellor advised me to get out of matters involving them , which I did . 
I followed that advice and respected it . 
After that point I did not lobby , I did not argue and I did not work on those files . 
In relation to all those matters , I took the ethics counsellor 's advice that I should be no part of decisions affecting their interest and that is exactly what I did . 
Mr. Leon Benoit ( Lakeland , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister cannot hide behind the ethics counsellor . 
Here are the facts : ACOA , which was responsible to the industry minister , paid $ 55 million to Irving Shipbuilding . 
The Irvings gave the minister a trip worth well over the $ 200 limit . 
In the eyes of the public , the gift bought the Irvings $ 55 million in taxpayers ' money . 
This is clearly a serious situation and what the minister did was wrong . 
Will he do the right thing and resign ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , long before any decision was made with respect to the Irving application , I withdrew . 
On the advice of the ethics counsellor , I withdrew . 
That file was then handled by others . 
It was analyzed by others . 
It was decided by others and was announced by others without my involvement . 
There was no connection between the two . 
I sought the advice and took the advice of the ethics counsellor . 
As a result there was no connection between the trip and the decision because I was not involved . 
Auditor General of Canada 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy -- Royal , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister can run but he cannot hide . 
Sooner or later the Auditor General 's report will come out . 
To that end , he promised Canadians an open government . 
Will the government bring in an amendment to the Auditor General Act to allow her to present her report even if the Prime Minister sets down this House early ? 
I can assure the Deputy Prime Minister that members on this side of the House are willing to pass that amendment faster than the Prime Minister can buy himself new jets . 
Hon. Don Boudria ( Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Auditor General reports to this House every three months . 
She can report to this House on any day . 
She could report to this House tomorrow or any other day . 
The Auditor General is perfectly entitled to do that . 
The hon. member knows this quite well . 
This fabrication of a story does not make reality . 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy -- Royal , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there is only one reason that the Prime Minister will not bring an amendment forward . 
He does not want to be held accountable . 
The Prime Minister could give himself a pay raise and buy new jets in record time . 
Why can we not see an amendment to enable the Auditor General to table her report early ? 
Hon. Don Boudria ( Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I hate to inform the hon. member about the rules and about the act but the Auditor General could bring that report tomorrow if that was what the Auditor General wished and if her report was ready . 
In fact there is no legal requirement to change anything to permit the Auditor General to report so-called early . 
She is entitled to do that already . 
Most of us already know this . 
Ethics 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie -- Bathurst , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as the Minister of Industry will know , his department is currently dealing with the Irving corporation on closing the Saint John shipyard with a secret $ 55 million deal contingent on the workers giving up their union . 
Yes , this is the same Irving corporation that thinks it owns New Brunswick and treated the minister to a free vacation that he forgot to tell everyone about . 
Will the Minister demonstrate that he is capable of standing up to the Irvings and make public his secret deal today ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there is no secret deal . 
The case was handled by other members of the government . 
I sought , received and followed advice from the ethics counsellor . 
I was not involved in reaching the decision in this case , but I am convinced there is no secret deal . 
I will leave it up to the others to answer questions on the deal . 
I personally was not involved in it . 
Canada Health and Social Transfer 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the former finance minister 's elimination of the Canada assistance plan has paved the way for the B.C. government to be the first province to impose time limits on social assistance . 
The 24-month rule will force tens of thousands into destitution and is being challenged today in B.C. 
There is a clear federal responsibility here through transfer payments and under the Constitution to provide essential services to all Canadians . 
Will the finance minister make it clear to the B.C. government that these changes are unlawful and unjust and must be stopped now ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I believe that the matter which the hon. member has raised is something that lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the province . 
I think that , as we have seen over the last number of years , support to the provinces under the CHST for health care as well as for those other areas of provincial spending that are covered by the CHST have increased . 
I expect that federal funding will continue to increase to the provinces for those purposes . 
Disaster Assistance 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver -- Sunshine Coast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my riding in British Columbia has suffered loss of life and millions in damage due to flooding . 
Liberal neglect , indifference and refusal to allow dredging of rivers , streams and creeks that are now in flood gets much of the blame . 
The mayor of Pemberton just told me they need help now to open the Hurley Road .  They need help now to build Bailey bridges .  They need help now to carry people to safety and food to those who are in need . 
Is the military on standby orders for emergency disaster relief efforts in British Columbia ? 
Hon. John McCallum ( Minister of National Defence , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the military has shown that it is always on standby for disasters that may happen anywhere across the country . 
We had up to 1,000 military personnel helping after the hurricane in Nova Scotia . 
We had up to 2,000 military in British Columbia helping to fight forest fires . 
If the need should arise in the current situation in British Columbia , I have no doubt that the chief of defence staff will once more accede to the request from the provincial government . 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver -- Sunshine Coast , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the people of British Columbia are in need of help . 
People have already died in British Columbia because of this disaster . 
The people in that area , the mayor and others , are busy saving lives . 
It is now raining again in British Columbia , with a possible crisis , due a lot as I have said because of an environment minister who will not let rivers or creeks be dredged . 
This could have been avoided . 
I want to know from the minister , is the government ready to be there now to help the people when they need the help ? 
Hon. John McCallum ( Minister of National Defence , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I agree with the hon. member that this is a very serious situation . 
I was in Kelowna the night the houses were burning . 
I saw with my own eyes the extreme gravity that natural disasters can bring to the people of British Columbia and Canada . 
I was there when our soldiers were there . 
We are working to advance payments . 
Should the need arise in this current state , I can assure the member that , as in past crises , the government will be there to help when it is needed . 
The Budget 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Finance is holding prebudget consultations in preparation for the next government budget . 
In the circles of the hon. member for LaSalle -- Émard , it is said openly that there will be major cuts in all government departments ' budgets . 
My question to the Minister of Finance is the following : Are his current prebudget consultations not mere window dressing , since the real decisions are being made outside , beyond Parliament 's reach ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , once the government has a budget ready , it will be presented here , in Parliament , and be adopted or not by Parliament . 
It is a bit too early to tell what exactly will be included in the next budget . 
I think now is the time to consult the public across Canada , to gather information and input . 
That is what I am doing , and so is the finance committee of this place . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this goes to show how preposterous this whole situation is , with one person drafting , and receiving recommendations , and another making decisions and providing direction . 
What people want to know is whether the budgets for employment insurance , old age pensions , health , education and the Kyoto protocol will be affected by this government 's next budget . 
That is what people want to know . 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think it is worth waiting for the next budget . 
In February , we brought down a budget , which was adopted in this House . 
This is a process that started on February 19 . 
The preparations for the next budget are ongoing , and it will be brought down when it is brought down . 
Member for LaSalle -- Émard 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is not only the industry minister who is having ethical problems these days . 
Last Friday the ethics counsellor failed to deliver his report on the new Liberal leader 's omission of Lansdowne Technologies from his declaration of assets . 
It sounds like the ethics counsellor is having a little trouble putting lipstick on that pig . 
Lansdowne received at least $ 12 million in government contracts . 
My question is , why does the government not admit that the new Liberal leader signed a false declaration of assets and put himself potentially in a $ 12 million conflict of interest ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have been through this in the House before . 
In fact , it does appear that there was an administrative error in connection with a report . 
However , it is clear that Lansdowne Technologies was wholly owned by a company that was included in the declaration . 
It was therefore covered by the declaration . 
In fact , it is tiresome to hear the member for Medicine Hat get up day after day and simply throw mud at someone who has more than complied with all the rules since 1988 . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , apparently the ethics counsellor does not see it that way or he would not be investigating . 
The new Liberal leader clearly owned this company . 
He repeatedly failed to include this company in his declaration of assets . 
My question is , when will the government admit that the new Liberal leader personally profited when Lansdowne picked up $ 12 million in federal contracts ? 
Does he not see that as a problem ? 
Hon. John Manley ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I see in today 's Hill Times that the hon. member describes himself `` giddy as a schoolgirl '' . 
I do not know what that says about his question , but I think he should restrain his giddiness and tendency to throw mud at hon. members . 
National Defence 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George -- Peace River , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on November 1 many families residing in private married quarters provided by the Canadian Forces housing authority will be slapped with yet another rent increase . 
Rents will increase by as much as 25 % on some bases . 
Civilians are protected from drastic rent increases by provincial law ; however , these laws do not apply to federal property . 
Why is the defence minister gouging Canadian Forces families with unreasonable rent increases ? 
Hon. John McCallum ( Minister of National Defence , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to point out that quality of life is a primary objective of the Department of National Defence . 
On the question of housing , since 1996 the government has invested $ 300 million in improvements to the quality of housing for our military people . 
At the same time , less than 25 % of our military personnel live in government provided houses . 
It is necessary to provide fairness across the board so there has to be equity in rents paid to the private sector and the government . 
There are strict limits on the rent increase that is allowable in any given year . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George -- Peace River , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we will leave it to our armed forces personnel to decide whether the minister 's definition of fairness is adequate and proper . 
Tenant protection acts guard against drastic and unfair rent increases ; however , provincial laws do not protect military families from massive rent increases at the hands of the minister and the Liberal government . 
To add insult to injury , the living standards of many of these housing units are quite simply deplorable and do not even meet provincial housing standards . 
Why does the Minister of National Defence think that he can get away with things that even slum lords would be held accountable for ? 
Hon. John McCallum ( Minister of National Defence , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , over the last five years , the top priority of the Department of National Defence has been to improve the quality of life . 
I have mentioned $ 300 million in housing , substantial salary increases , substantial improvements in the health care system and the treatment of PTSD , and substantial improvements in family resource centres . 
We are extremely mindful of the contribution that our members make . 
This has become all too clear over the last couple of weeks . 
The well-being , welfare and good quality of life of members of the Canadian Forces remains a top priority for the government . 
Canadian Grand Prix 
Mr. Réal Ménard ( Hochelaga -- Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , while Normand Legault , the promoter of the Grand Prix , is working to save the event , the government is negotiating with Molson behind the scenes and may derail the whole process . 
Instead of all these parallel approaches , would it not be better for the government to send a clear message to the private sector by making a public commitment to a financial contribution that would save the Grand Prix in the end ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , discussions involving the Government of Canada , the Government of Quebec and the City of Montreal are ongoing , in an attempt to find a solution . 
We hope to find a solution so that Formula 1 racing in Canada can continue . 
Ethics 
Mr. Stephen Harper ( Leader of the Opposition , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to follow-up the questions put to the industry minister . 
He claimed to have been un-involved in cabinet decisions related to the Irving shipyards during the blackout period . 
I note that on July 19 , 2002 , in the New Brunswick Telegraph Journal and on January 22 , 2003 , in the The Evening News he gave indications to the public both times that he was intimately briefed and knowledgeable on the procurement process and the decisions being taken in cabinet . 
I would like to ask the minister , was he involved in these decisions or was he simply deceiving the public as to his knowledge ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , from and after the time when I spoke to the ethics counsellor I was out of the decision process . 
If I was asked publicly , I said only that the government would make a decision when the government had something to announce . 
I took no part in the decision-making process . 
The Prime Minister 's Office , the PCO , and other members of my own department , including the deputy minister , were involved . 
I was not . 
The decision was made without my involvement from and after the time the ethics counsellor gave me advice . 
It was then included in the budget in February of this year , which was news to me , and it was followed through with the usual procedures . 
Border Security 
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg -- Jacques-Cartier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Ahmad Cheriam , an individual wanted by the Quebec police in connection with a juvenile prostitution ring , crossed the Canadian border without any problem , in spite of two arrest warrants and a national all points bulletin . 
How can the government explain that , despite the investments in security that were made , our borders are still sieves ? 
Hon. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wish to inform all members that there was no lookout in our system at the time that this individual entered Canada . 
I can tell the member that since July 2000 customs officers have apprehended and arrested 2,136 individuals , criminals who were in our system . 
If they are in our system , we stop them and arrest them . 
Agriculture 
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the cattle industry and Canadians have been kept in the dark by the government on the issue of BSE and the resulting border closure . 
It was confirmed today by the U.S. , while we were told a week ago by the U.S. consulate , that in the next few days the U.S. government will publish the rule change that will allow the importation of live cattle under 30 months of age . 
Why do the Canadian cattle industry and Canadians continually have to get this critical information from the United States instead of its own government ? 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have frequent conversations with my counterpart in the United States and I can tell members that I had one of those within the last hour and a half . 
The secretary in the United States is not able to inform anyone as to when the regulations will be published . 
The Americans have a process that is very similar to what we have . 
Regulations are published and then there is a comment period . 
No announcement has been made as to when the regulations will be published and that has been confirmed to me today . 
We anticipate it will be in the not too distant future . 
No date has been set and that date has not been given to anyone at this time . 
The Environment 
Mr. Joe Comartin ( Windsor -- St. Clair , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , climate change and global warming have contributed both in number and severity to many environmental disasters . 
We ratified the Kyoto protocol because of that reality . 
Now the environment commissioner tells us that we will only meet 50 % of our targeted quota for reducing greenhouse gases . 
We also hear that the future Prime Minister intends , as he did as finance minister , to slash department budgets . 
Will the government commit today that funding for Kyoto will be secured and safe from the knife of the next Prime Minister ? 
Hon. David Anderson ( Minister of the Environment , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to inform the hon. member that we have in place a plan for implementation of our Kyoto target . 
We fully expect to achieve that and obviously , as has been said on a number of occasions , there will be need for further budgetary measures . 
There will be a need perhaps for tax measures . 
There will indeed be the need for the provinces and ordinary citizens to act as well . 
We have in fact a plan which we will put into effect to achieve our target . 
Presence in Gallery 
The Speaker : 
I draw the attention of hon. members to the presence in the gallery of the recipients of the Governor General 's Awards in commemoration of the Persons Case : Nicole Demers of Laval , Quebec ; Eira Friesen of Winnipeg , Manitoba ; Joyce Hayden of Whitehorse , Yukon ; Marilou McPhedran of Toronto , Ontario ; Jayanti Negi of Edmonton , Alberta ; and Jennifer Hustwitt of Waterloo , Ontario . 
Some hon. members : Hear , hear .

ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
Government Response to Petitions 
Mr. Geoff Regan ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36(8) I have the honour to table , in both official languages , the government 's response to 10 petitions . 
Interparliamentary Delegations 
Mr. David Price ( Compton -- Stanstead , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 34(1) I have the honour to present to the House , in both official languages , the report of the Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association , which represented Canada at the annual tour of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly held in Italy from July 28 to August 2 . 
Committees of the House 
Aboriginal Affairs , Northern Development and Natural Resources 
Mr. Raymond Bonin ( Nickel Belt , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present the seventh report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs , Northern Development and Natural Resources regarding its order of reference of Tuesday , September 23 , concerning the supplementary estimates A. Your committee has considered the supplementary estimates A and has agreed to report without amendment . 
Whistle Blowers Protection Act 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-457 , an act respecting the protection of whistle blowers and to amend the Auditor General Act , the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act and the Public Service Staff Relations Act . 
He said : Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to introduce this bill today , which would have the effect of introducing a legal framework for true whistleblower protection in the country . 
More and more people feel strongly that this is long overdue , especially in light of the recent horrific example of the Radwanski scandal . 
The reason this bill calls for amending the Public Service Staff Relations Act and the Auditor General Act is that we believe the Auditor General 's office should be the proper place to which whistleblowers may come . 
We know that they need to come to some place where they feel safe and free of reprisals , and we believe the office of the Auditor General is the right institution to be this new whistleblower office . 
I am happy to introduce this legislation today . 
( Motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
Canada Elections Act 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-458 , an act to amend the Canada Elections Act . 
She said : Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure today to introduce this bill to amend the Canada Elections Act to fully include the dependants of Canadian Forces personnel within the special voting provisions designed to take into consideration their relocation away from home communities in the service of their country . 
Currently under the act , members of the armed forces , including reserves , are permitted to have their votes counted in their normal home electoral constituencies simply by filling out a special residency form . 
However their spouses and other dependents who accompany them on their postings have no such choice and must vote in the ridings in which their partners have been posted . 
The purpose of this bill is to remedy this unfairness by extending to Canadian Forces dependants the same rights as their spouses or parents to choose their home constituencies for voting purposes . 
( Motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
Petitions 
Health 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the pleasure of tabling two petitions today . 
One is from the regions of Calgary , Edmonton , St. Paul , Beiseker and Whitecourt . 
The petitioners call upon Parliament to provide Canadians with greater access to natural health products and to restore freedom of choice in personal health care by enacting Bill C-420 , an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act . 
Marriage 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I also have the pleasure of presenting a petition from my riding of Wild Rose and the towns of Olds and Didsbury . 
The petitioners call on Parliament to pass legislation to recognize the institution of marriage in federal law as being a lifelong union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan -- Shuswap , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to present to the House seven petitions totalling 1,846 signatures . 
The petitioners are requesting that the Government of Canada hold a binding national referendum in the next general election to ask the following question . 
Must the Government of Canada continue to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others , yes or no ? 
Religious Freedom 
Mr. Joe Comuzzi ( Thunder Bay -- Superior North , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour today to present petitions from the people of Thunder Bay -- Superior North with respect to hate literature under section 318 and section 319 of the Criminal Code . 
The petitioners call upon Parliament to protect the rights of Canadians to be free to share their religious beliefs without fear of prosecution . 
I might add that the issue was referred to the justice committee and to the Minister of Justice , and I am advised by both that those precautions have been entered into the legislation . 
Marriage 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to present a petition signed by a number of Canadians , including from my own riding of Mississauga South . 
The petition concerns the issue of marriage . 
The petitioners point out that on June 10 the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that same sex couples must have the legal right to marry on the basis of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
The petitioners also point out that the government can only do this in areas of law within its jurisdiction and that only the federal government can pass legislation to provide who can marry . 
Therefore , the petitioners call upon Parliament to invoke the notwithstanding clause to pass a law so that only two persons of the opposite sex can be married . 
Ms. Judy Sgro ( York West , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 I would like to present five petitions on behalf of constituents from my riding of York West and from the greater Toronto area . 
The petitioners call upon Parliament to take all necessary means to maintain and support the definition of marriage in Canada as a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present three petitions from Brampton Centre . 
The first petition calls upon the House to recognize marriage as the union of a man and a women to the exclusion of all others . 
Child Pornography 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my second petition asks the House to recognize and protect all children from suffering under pedophilia and that all activities involving pedophilia be outlawed . 
Stem Cell Research 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the third petition asks that Parliament encourage adult stem cell research to prevent sickness and diseases suffered by many Canadians throughout the country . 
Labelling of Alcoholic Beverages 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to table a petition signed by hundreds of people across Canada who are very concerned about fetal alcohol syndrome . 
The petitioners note that the consumption of alcoholic beverages while pregnant has been shown to cause adverse alcohol related conditions such as FAS . 
They note that awareness of the hazards of consuming alcohol while pregnant has shown to reduce alcohol consumption during pregnancy . 
They note that Parliament overwhelmingly passed a motion in support of such a measure on April 23 , 2001 . 
They call upon the House to take measures that would prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages in Canada unless that container carries the warning , `` Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause birth defects '' . 
Cruelty to Animals 
Mr. James Lunney ( Nanaimo -- Alberni , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions . 
The first petition , which is in two parts , was signed by about 170 people from my riding of Nanaimo , Nanoose , Lantzville , Parksville and Qualicum Beach who are concerned with animal cruelty . 
People are concerned about the frequent incidents of cruelty to animals and declare that these incidents undermine Canadian values of compassion . 
They are calling upon Parliament to take action to introduce and enforce stronger legislation prohibiting cruelty to animals that would protect those that cannot protect themselves . 
Health 
Mr. James Lunney ( Nanaimo -- Alberni , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition , which is again in two parts , contains about 350 signatures , largely from my riding and the communities I just mentioned , but also some from Alberta and Ontario , including Fonthill , Welland , Burlington , Port Colborne and other communities , and it concerns Bill C-420 . 
They are calling for changes in enhancing freedom of choice in health care . 
They want Parliament to recognize that herbs , dietary supplements and other traditional natural products should be classified as food , not drugs , and that scientific evidence now confirms that many diseases and disorders listed in schedule A can in fact be mitigated through the judicious use of natural health products . 
They are calling for the changes recommended by Bill C-420 that was debated this morning . 
Mr. Norman Doyle ( St. John 's East , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to present a petition on behalf of a number of people from all across Newfoundland and Labrador . 
The petitioners are calling upon Parliament to provide Canadians with greater access to natural health products and to restore freedom of choice in personal health care by enacting Bill C-420 , an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act . 
Marriage 
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont -- Dundas -- Charlottenburgh , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I have the honour to present two petitions signed by a total of 5,398 citizens . 
The petitioners are asking for confirmation that marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others , and that Parliament will take all necessary steps , within the limits of its jurisdiction , to preserve this definition of marriage in Canada . 
For these reasons , the petitioners call on Parliament to take all necessary steps to preserve and uphold in Canada the above-mentioned definition of marriage . 
Health 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton -- Strathcona , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I too , like some of my colleagues today , would like to present a petition , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , of approximately 500 names from the Edmonton , Alberta area and I believe Ontario , as well , calling upon Parliament to provide Canadians with greater access to non-drug preventive and medical options , as well as information about these options , and to sanction the personal choices of Canadians by clarifying the currently vague definitions of food and drugs in the Food and Drugs Act . 
It also calls upon Parliament to enact Bill C-420 , an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act . 
Questions on the Order Paper 
Mr. Geoff Regan ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the following questions will be answered today : Nos. 247 and 249 . 
Question No. 247 -- 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
How much has the government spent on advertising to promote the National Child Benefit in 2002 and 2003 ? 
Hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib. ) : 
The Government of Canada is committed to making Canadians aware of what federal programs are available and how to access them . 
For 2002-03 , there was one campaign focused on the national child benefit , NCB . 
This campaign was aimed at raising awareness of programs and services supporting children and families and at providing details on where to get more information on these services . 
The campaign highlighted the national child benefit , NCB program for low income families as there was low awareness of the NCB among the Canadian public . 
The NCB is a federal/provincial/territorial initiative to which the Government of Canada contributes by increasing the Canada child tax benefit , CCTB , for low income families with children . 
As with all federal government advertising campaigns , the campaign was focus-tested for integrity and efficacy to help ensure that it would meet its stated objectives . 
Post-testing confirmed that the campaign had , indeed , achieved its objectives . 
The Government has an obligation to inform Canadians about its services . 
In order to reach Canadians , the campaign included advertisements in 
· over 100 national , local , ethnic and aboriginal TV stations , 
· over 100 national and local radio stations , 
· about 1,500 daily , weekly , ethnic and aboriginal newspapers , and 
· several family targeted monthly magazines . 
The cost of this campaign was $ 6.5 million . 
Question No. 249 -- 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis : 
Pursuant to Section 3(1) of the Regulations Respecting the Disposition of Seized Property , Seized Property Management Act , how many properties seized since the coming into force of the Regulations have been disposed of : (a) by public tender ; and (b) by public auction ? 
Hon. Ralph Goodale ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board and Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians , Lib. ) : 
Under section 3(1) of the Disposal Regulations of the Seized Property Management Act , properties are defined as any properties seized or restrained by court warrant or forfeited to Her Majesty under various proceeds of crime or controlled drugs and substances offences . 
This would include all (I) moveable assets , ( vehicles , vessels , hydroponic equipment , artworks , furniture etc. ) , ( ii ) financial instruments and ( iii ) real property .

Government Orders 
Canadian Forces Superannuation Act 
The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-37 , an act to amend the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts , be read the third time and passed . 
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich -- Gulf Islands , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to represent the constituents of Saanich -- Gulf Islands on this very important bill . 
I also want to thank the member for Edmonton -- Strathcona for switching our times .  The two of us switched around . 
This is a critically important issue . 
Bill C-37 , an act to amend the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts , would modernize the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act in order to maintain a competitive pension plan comparable to those in the private sector , keeping in mind the unique working conditions of the Canadian Forces . 
Up until now , the Canadian Forces pension plan has been woefully inadequate . 
I will get into some of those details but at the outset I want to take a minute to talk about the importance of our Canadian Forces . 
I believe all members in the House would agree with me that the men and women of the Canadian Forces have done an outstanding job serving all Canadians .  They have been put in harm 's way . 
As we know , there have been recent fatalities on some of their missions : Operation Apollo , the war on terrorism , the work in Afghanistan and various peacekeeping missions . 
These men and women are out there serving us and looking after our interests . 
I applaud each and every one of them for the work they do both at home and abroad . 
It is not just their work abroad . 
As we know , during the fires this summer in my home province of British Columbia in the interior around Kelowna , up in the Kamloops area and throughout the interior down in the Cranbrook area , the forces were there . 
When they are called upon their services are unwaivering . 
More recently , the member for Fraser Valley , whose new area will be the Pemberton area , and the member for West Vancouver -- Sunshine Coast talked about the recent floods . 
If the military is required they will be the first to respond when asked to do so . 
The forces ' commitment to us is unquestionable and we need to offer them the same level of commitment . 
That is the point that I was trying to make . 
I applaud all these Canadian men and women . 
I am pleased we finally have a bill before the House that will modernize the pension act . 
I question the government as to why it took so long to bring forward this bill . 
I hope the bill will actually become law because it is one I support , but we have all been informed that the House will likely rise , adjourn or prorogue on November 7 , which is less than three weeks from now . 
That will be it until some time in the new year when the member for LaSalle -- Émard gets the keys to 24 Sussex and tries to come in with a throne speech and do some grandstanding for an election . 
It is not acceptable . 
This bill is just one example of many important issues on which we need to be in this place working . 
We need to be here looking after the interests of Canadians . 
We have many critically important issues but this place has virtually come to a grinding halt . 
Yes , we are here in body , but the problem is that as we look at the government members they are so caught up . 
The current Prime Minister who resides at 24 Sussex Drive has absolutely no power in the government caucus , and the member for LaSalle -- Émard , a backbencher with no tangible power , holds all the real power of the caucus . 
Nothing is getting done . 
This place has become irrelevant . 
It is so sad . 
We do not get a clear indication of where the government is going , and there are so many issues that need to be dealt with . 
Let me talk about a few of the issues in Bill C-37 and what it would do for the Canadian Forces . 
Right now under the Canadian Forces pension plan individuals must have continuous service . 
If there is a break in service they do not qualify . 
That is not acceptable and this bill would to fix that . 
The number of pensionable years of service would bring the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act more in line with the Public Service Superannuation Act . 
The average salary and the number of years contributions were made to the plan would be used to calculate the pension . 
The bill provides greater flexibility and is more in line with the private sector , as it should be . 
It is long overdue that we actually started providing the same level of commitment to the men and women in the Canadian Forces as they have shown us . 
Bill C-37 would give our Canadian Forces early access to pension benefits if they choose . 
Right now they are not entitled to benefits until they reach the age of 60 . 
Under the new plan , although members the Canadian Forces may have the option of retiring early , between the ages of 50 and 60 , at a reduced pension , at least they would have other options available and portable . 
Under the current plan these options are not portable . 
I would argue that the most important component is for the reservists . 
The reservists , a very significant component of our military , would now be included in the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act . 
At the present time they receive some type of a gratuity , which is equivalent to some severance pay , but they are not looked after . 
Some of these reservists were also out fighting the forest fires in British Columbia and protecting Canadians . 
When called upon they do not quiver . 
They are there . 
It is high time we did the same for them . 
Those are some of the reasons for some of the changes we see in Bill C-37 , a bill that is long overdue . 
I have to admit that I am skeptical whether the bill will actually become law .  I wonder whether it will be like so many other bills in the past that have died on the order paper and are collecting dust . 
If that were to happen then all the work that is done in the House becomes irrelevant . 
I want to make a few more specific points on why it is so important that we look after our troops . 
Ironically , as we are here debating Bill C-37 , trying to look after our troops , acknowledging that we perhaps have not looked after them in the past , we may not have been treating them fairly and perhaps we could do more for them , where has our Prime Minister been ? 
I will read a press release from the Ottawa Sun . 
In reference to our military our Right Hon. Prime Minister said `` But it's never enough . 
They all need more .  And they all have plans for more '' . 
I would like to remind the Prime Minister that the men and women flying the Sea Kings have done an outstanding job . 
These Sea King helicopters should have been replaced 10 or 15 years ago . 
I have watched the song and dance year after year in this place about procurement .  We still have no idea of what the government is doing . 
It always says `` Wait until tomorrow . 
It is coming . 
We have split the contract . 
The contract has now been put back to the other , the ordinance and the air frame '' . 
It is one thing after the other . 
The government is always playing politics to ensure that their Liberal friends get a piece of the pie . 
It manipulates contracts so possibly some Liberal contributor will get his or her fair share of the pie . 
It is so wrong . 
However , when the Prime Minister wants to order two Challenger jets , which were absolutely not needed , those are delivered . 
He has the whole process run through the House before the ink dries on his signature when he puts his name down that he wants something . 
When he decides he wants something , 24 hours later it is a done deal through the back door . 
That is wrong . 
The men and women of the Canadian Forces put their lives on the line looking after our needs at home and abroad . 
We all know about the terrible tragedies we have had abroad involving these men and women . 
Their fellow comrades , who stood beside them , soldier on the next day . 
Their commitment is unwaivering . 
Where is our commitment to them ? 
Why is it so pathetic ? 
Why are we not giving them the tools and resources they need to do the job ? 
The Prime Minister leaves the impression that they are a bunch of whiny people who always want more and are never happy . 
He says we have the best equipment and that we are better equipped than anybody else . 
Oh yes ? 
Maybe the jet the Prime Minister is on is better than that of anybody else in the area and maybe the equipment in which the cabinet is flying around is better than that of anyone else , but it is sure not the case for our men and women . 
The men and women of 443 Squadron , the Sea King base in Patricia Bay in my riding , never complain . 
They are out there and they do the very best job . 
It is the same on the other coast . 
But what do we do for them ? 
Again I look at Bill C-37 . 
Our defence critic has recommended that we support it and I agree with him . 
He says it is high time we did something , but the government is bringing in this bill only weeks before it plans to prorogue . 
Everybody in this place knows that on November 7 the Prime Minister is hightailing it out of here . 
I am not sure if he will be golfing ; it might be a little cold for him in Ottawa . 
He is getting out of here because he does not want to be embarrassed when the member for LaSalle -- Émard , who as we know has the real power now , officially gets the power at the Liberal Party convention . 
There has been absolutely outstanding cooperation today , unprecedented in the House of Commons , between the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and the leader of the Canadian Alliance , in the interests of Canadians . 
I would argue that those two individuals have put the interests of the Canadian people ahead of their own interests and that of their respective parties . 
That is what we should be doing in this House for our military . 
We should not be playing politics or playing games . 
But the record speaks for itself . 
It is disgraceful . 
There is the helicopter replacement program . 
Also , there are the horror stories we have heard about the equipment our men and women are left with when they are overseas . 
These men and women are stretched so thin in numbers that they are putting in double and triple time . 
There have been times when we have had our navy in the gulf and of course there was usually a Sea King on board most of the ships . 
I have spoken to the commander of the 443 . 
He said he did not have an aircraft in the hangar that he could send out on a ship . 
Ships had to be sent out without an aircraft on board ; then they tried to do a swap overseas . 
Do hon. members know what that means ? 
Sure , they do a swap when they are overseas , but extra time has to be put in . 
Yes , there are multiple crews and the military tries to send a crew back , but these people have been worked as they have never been worked before . 
Their support , as I said earlier , was unwavering . 
They do not question . 
I was on the docks for at least four or five departures of ships to the gulf . 
I listened to the young men and women with young families who said that they were proud to serve all Canadians . 
However , where are we ? 
Where are the members of the House for those men and women of the service ? 
We have had a terrible record for the military over the last 10 years as the number of troops have fallen and the budgets have fallen . 
What is so troubling are the quotes from our Prime Minister , who says they always want more , they are never happy , and they always have a wish list . 
I would argue that equipment such as the Sea Kings , with which I am familiar because of my riding , should not be on a wish list at all . 
It is pathetic that they have to be on a wish list when the Prime Minister , and I keep coming back to this but it is fact , wants a couple of new private jets with marble bathrooms and the works to fly his cabinet ministers around and can have that done before the ink dries on his signature ; try to tell me there is not something wrong with that . 
Again , the contract was split for the Sea Kings . 
Originally the contract was up for tender . 
We have heard this song and dance for so many years now that it is not even funny . 
We can talk to any military expert : when the contract was split to separate the ordnance and the airframe , it was pure politics . 
It was not in the interests of anyone . 
It was not in the interests of the people who fly them . 
A lot of people pointed fingers , but it was the government playing politics for its friends so that it could control , manipulate and tailor the process and ensure where the contracts would go . 
That is wrong . 
We are going to support this bill , as we should . 
It is the right thing . 
It will modernize the pension act for our military people , which needs to be reformed . 
The reform is long overdue , but I have a great fear about this . 
I urge the Liberals to show us that they care enough about our servicemen and servicewomen to sit in this House long enough to see this bill get royal assent . 
I do not think they will . 
This is just another charade , with them saying they have to get a bill down here or something . 
Really , it is meaningless , because we are not sure who is in power . 
One person is living at 24 Sussex , but another one is holding the caucus meetings . 
One is in charge , but one is not . 
One has the power of the backbench and one does not . 
Canadian people do not care about that . 
They want to see us make changes in here , but the Liberals have brought in this bill less than three weeks before they plan to prorogue just to waste everybody 's time . 
If they actually care about the unwavering commitment given by the men and women of our forces , then I challenge every government member to pressure his or her own House leader to make sure we are here after November 7 working on this bill , making sure that it goes to the Senate , and making sure that it gets royal assent . 
I ask them to show us they care about the men and women of our Canadian Forces . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George -- Peace River , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , perhaps I am not quite as pessimistic as my colleague from Saanich -- Gulf Islands in that we are debating third reading of Bill C-37 today . 
I hope that the bill will be passed through the House of Commons in the next few days and that the Senate will sit long enough to see it pass through the other place and indeed get royal assent . 
I think that is extremely important . 
That is why I certainly applaud the government for belatedly bringing forward this legislation . 
As I said in my remarks , it should have been done some five years ago , but as we on the opposition side often say , better late than never . 
As my colleague says , it is certainly suspicious . 
Having gone through a couple of Parliaments , I have noted that just before an impending election there are certain hot topic issues that the government has taken considerable heat over during the lifetime of a Parliament and in the dying days of the Parliament we see it bring forward legislation that does have support from all parties and all sides of the House . 
Then the government rushes it through , with our support , with our assistance , with our help , so that government members can stand up during an election campaign and say , `` Look at all the great and wonderful things we did . 
We do care about our military because we put through the changes to the superannuation act and changed the pensions and included the reserves '' , et cetera . 
In this case , I will say that I do not care what the reasoning is for it . 
It is still the right thing to do , belatedly , so I certainly will be supporting these efforts . 
I want to comment just briefly on the situation in my home province , the province of my colleague . 
British Columbia has had an absolutely devastating year . 
First there were the forest fires and now , as could be noted during question period today , my colleague from West Vancouver -- Sunshine Coast has raised concerns about a couple of lives lost , and more feared lost , in the terrible flooding in the lower mainland of British Columbia . 
British Columbia right now is reeling . 
It is bruised and battered . 
I want to ask my colleague about the specific issue of the removal of regular forces and bases from the mainland of British Columbia . 
I think it is unbelievable that this has been allowed to happen and that the base in Chilliwack , for example , was closed down . 
Nevertheless , that has happened . 
I would suggest that at a minimum we should have additional militia units , or reserves , in British Columbia , if for no other reason than to react to natural disaster tragedies that occur from time to time , like the flooding and the forest fires . 
Despite the fact that the forces from Edmonton did absolutely yeoman service in coming across the Rocky Mountains , getting into British Columbia , and helping to fight those forest fires this summer , I still do believe that communities in British Columbia could be better served with at least additional militia units , if not by having a base there with regular forces on the mainland of British Columbia . 
The City of Prince George in my riding is one of the cities that has been lobbying hard for that , but so far we have not seen the government move in that regard . 
I would put that question to my colleague . 
What are his thoughts about it , especially given the present disaster situation in B.C. ? 
Mr. Gary Lunn : 
Mr. Speaker , I would first like to comment on being so skeptical about whether the government actually means the bill to pass . 
I need only go back to the government 's record . 
We have seen many important pieces of legislation die on the Order Paper because of politics . 
This is an important bill for our servicemen and servicewomen , and I hope , as does our defence critic from Prince George -- Peace River , that it does receive royal assent . 
With respect to closing the base in Chilliwack , greater Vancouver is the largest populated urban area west of Toronto , without question . 
An hon. member : By far . 
Mr. Gary Lunn : By far , no question . 
Greater Vancouver is a very important economic centre , with a huge population base , both in the city and in all the surrounding communities in the Fraser Valley . 
This goes back to the government 's commitment to the Canadian Forces . 
The government shut down the base in Chilliwack . 
There is now no land base in the province of British Columbia . 
The navy is on the west coast and there are some air force wings up in Comox , but this is not acceptable . 
The land bases should be there . 
What it comes down to is how the services across Canada have been cut drastically and how those that are there are overworked or stretched thin . 
I believe the Auditor General would acknowledge this . 
She has written reports in the past in which she has indicated that it is now very difficult for the forces to meet their obligations with current numbers . 
By all means , I agree with the member . 
At a minimum , the government must start putting back the militia . 
We need greater militia in these areas . 
They are an integral part of the Canadian Forces and can serve us very well . 
Again it comes back to the government 's record . 
It speaks for itself with what the government has done , whether it be the Sea Kings , shutting down the base in Chilliwack , cutting the budgets , or cutting the number of servicemen and servicewomen in our forces . 
This is about the government 's committment to the military . 
The government should think about the unwavering committment of our military to all Canadians and to us . 
The government should try giving back to these men and women just a fraction of what they have given to us and our country , and they then would be a whole lot better off . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton -- Strathcona , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-37 , an act to amend the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts . 
It always gives me great pleasure to rise in the House especially when I see that there is so much interest among so many members to hear my wisdom and what I bring to this debate , namely to take that advice and hopefully use it in the future . 
Being from Edmonton , I would begin by identifying the fact that I and others in Edmonton are lucky to have the Canadian Forces base located there . 
Members of the Canadian armed forces in Edmonton always do a great job as they do right across this country . 
I particularly want to identify , as my colleague from Prince George -- Peace River did , the work of the Edmonton base this summer when it came to providing assistance in battling fires and helping Canadians to safety in the interior of B.C. and around Kelowna . 
They put a lot of effort and work into that , risking their lives as usual . 
I want to acknowledge that because we were all proud of the work they did to help Canadians during that very troubling time . 
I would like to focus on what the bill would do and what it would mean for members of the armed forces . 
This legislation makes changes to the pension benefit scheme provided under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act which includes a reduction in the minimum qualifying period for a pension to two years , tying benefit eligibility to years of pensionable service rather than completion of a period of engagement in the Canadian Forces , and an immediate pension to a person who has completed 25 years of paid service and has at least 2 years of pensionable service . 
As we have heard from colleagues across the House , all members believe that we owe this type of pension benefit to the men and women of the armed forces . 
They do an incredible job to protect Canadians , sometimes in combat situations , peacekeeping situations and also by promoting our values and interests in helping people realize their freedom around the world . 
Not many people would ever argue against those sort of changes . 
The bill would provide regulation-making authority to adapt the provisions of the act so as to apply it to prescribed members of the reserve force and to deal with other matters , such as elective service , that are presently provided for in the act . 
It would consolidate a number of the regulation-making powers in the act and would make certain structural improvements to the act , such as moving general provisions that are presently in part I of the act to part IV and making those provisions applicable to the whole act . 
On this side of the House we in the opposition are obviously in favour of the bill because it would improve the conditions of our armed forces . 
We support our veterans as has been shown in numerous question periods , especially on recent issues where we are fighting for benefits for the spouses of veterans . 
We also support our military . 
We have said that on numerous occasions despite some of the things we heard in today 's question period . 
The opposition has always called for better respect for our armed forces by increasing the amount of funding that would be given to the military seeing that we have some huge challenges . 
I will be discussing those during my speech , particularly equipment and personnel challenges that our military will be facing in the future . 
Last spring the Canadian Alliance put out a white paper on defence called `` The New North Strong and Free '' . 
We identified a number of strengths and weaknesses , and made some recommendations as to what needed to be addressed to improve the state of our military . 
It is our mission statement of how our government should run the defence department and how we would allow the armed forces to once again flourish . 
The paper contains 33 recommendations . 
It is unfortunate that after 10 years of mismanagement by the government and the former finance minister , soon to be leader of that party , must take some responsibility for this . 
He has allowed the military to practically fall apart and we need to take 33 steps to get where it should be today . 
Here are some quick facts about what has happened to the military under the watch of the current government . 
The regular force personnel strength has fallen by 30 % since 1993 . 
Our military has no heavy air or sealift capacity . 
During the 2002 mission in Afghanistan , Canada could not sustain 800 troops for longer than six months . 
We only put three ships to sea instead of the proposed six . 
Most Canadians have heard the dreadful stories about our Sea Kings . 
This is their 40th year and they will not be replaced until 2007 .  This is 14 years after the Liberal government had already cancelled the original helicopter contract . 
Even today in question period the Minister of National Defence talked about how that side of the House was working diligently to solve this problem . 
Going at this rate , we will probably not see any changes for another 10 years and that is just unacceptable . 
We have had some serious problems with those Sea Kings . 
Our tribal class destroyers are 33 years old and there is not even a plan to replace them . 
Our CF-18 fighter aircraft have been reduced to 80 from 122 . 
There are no army helicopters to support our troops in the field in an age where troop mobility is a prime concern . 
There was , of course , the unfortunate situation recently where some of our troops were killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan . 
The jeeps were proven deadly for our soldiers because the Liberal government was not willing to properly purchase the jeeps that were required , not only for combat ready situations but in peacekeeping roles as well . 
Our men and women go out in peacekeeping roles , but they need to be able to protect themselves . 
We in the House , and the government especially , need to equip these men and women to do just that and not send them out half prepared to do battle , especially at certain times when they have to protect themselves , let alone the missions that they are on while on the ground . 
The former finance minister and the Liberals have dismissed the military as unimportant following the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the U.S.S.R. There has been a real decline in the attitude of the government toward the military because it feels there are no more threats in the world . 
Obviously , that has been proved to be quite a wrong attitude to have , especially in light of world events that we have seen . 
Here in North America all of us know the tragic event that took place on September 11 , and the significance of that particular event as we are moving forward in the world and what sort of challenges we face in not only helping to protect people around the world , but protecting the security of North America . 
The terrorist attacks totally changed the strategic environment in which Canada operates . 
This pertains not only to our home turf now , but in the role we play internationally . 
Our best ally , the United States , has declared a war on terrorism . 
This is a war that we said we support in Canada and we will do what we can to help stamp out terrorism around the world . 
However , from the work that has been done on the other side of the House by the government , it seems that the Liberals have only paid lip service to this particular commitment . 
They have ignored our responsibilities to our allies in Iraq and have not properly equipped our troops for Afghanistan , which is a shame . 
We on this side of the House recognize the significance of what happened on September 11 . 
We have pushed the Liberals to focus on both security domestically and abroad . 
Domestically , the Liberals have failed , especially the minister responsible for customs , who touts her border policies , but then starves our customs agents of the resources necessary to do their jobs . 
I have stood in the House in question period on a number of occasions pointing to the fact that the strength of our military has to be linked to how serious we take security here at home , but the minister continues to dismiss those arguments saying that the government is doing all it can . 
However , when we look not only at the condition of our military and the resources that it has to do its job , the same can be said for our front line customs officers being starved . 
They do not have the right resources to protect Canadians . 
It is a shame that in this day and age , after saying it was going to beef up border security , we have not seen any of the money that was put aside since the anti-terrorist legislation was passed . 
No money has actually trickled down to the front lines for basic things like computers and resources for our customs agents . 
So , domestically the Liberals have failed , especially the minister in charge of customs . 
Significantly , the government has also starved our military and its ability to do its job . 
Let us go over defence funding . 
Recently in question period , we heard one of the Liberal members on the other side say it was actually the opposition that was not committed to defence . 
I do not know which planet he is on to suggest that sort of thing . 
However , let us go over the government 's record because that is where the facts speak much louder than any words that have come across from the other side of the floor . 
The former finance minister , soon to be Prime Minister , slashed $ 20 billion from the defence department since 1993 . 
Mr. Speaker , could you imagine what sort of impact that has had on our military ? 
If government members want to talk about facts and who is committed to our military , let us look at that one . 
It is a significant number . 
The Auditor General told the defence committee that the armed forces will face a $ 30 billion deficit in equipment by 2012 . 
That is a huge challenge that our military is facing in the future . 
We are at the bottom of the G-8 and NATO in defence spending , at $ 7.7 billion per annum . 
The government could counter these destructive trends by implementing our recommendation No. 2 that was outlined in the white paper that I spoke about earlier . 
It calls for an increase in the defence budget which should be accelerated to provide an additional $ 1.2 billion per year over and above the increases in the 2003 federal budget bringing the immediate increases to $ 2 billion per year . 
It is money that is required right away to bring the standards of our military up to a level where it would have the resources to fight the fights that it may have to take part in through our obligations around the world . 
That does not even include the commitments we need to make in order to bring the equipment up to par so that we do not have this huge deficit in the future . 
We go further in the next recommendation saying that defence spending must be increased to NATO standards . 
We have an obligation to meet our commitments , especially our international commitments , where other countries rely on us to do so . 
We are a member of NATO , yet year after year we are failing on those commitments because the government has not put the resources in place , especially when it comes to our military . 
These are standards that the government , and especially the former finance minister , has totally ignored . 
If we are to undo the damage done by this particular government , it is more than just a funding issue . 
It is a personnel issue and that is what I spoke about when I said there were challenges on both sides , equipment and personnel . 
We need to increase the regular force to 80,000 individuals . 
We have had quite a reduction over the years , but it would be necessary to meet our obligations , especially if we look at some of the challenges where we have troops rotating out of Afghanistan . 
There is also a call for further peacekeeping resources in Iraq and here at home in getting our military involved in assisting with natural disasters . 
We need to increase the number of troops . 
That is a significant problem that we are facing . 
The reserves should also be increased to 60,000 from 45,000 individuals . 
Many of them are army militia . 
We must specifically address the different branches of our military . 
If we look at the different branches , there are some real big challenges in every area , whether it is the army , the air force or the navy . 
I will take a moment to identify those challenges so Canadians at home can see the real picture of what we are facing . 
We need to expand our special forces in the army , especially the JTF-2 . 
That is something we found over the last little while . 
We have really been stretched to the limit . 
Afghanistan has proven the need for these special forces . 
The JTF-2 distinguished itself there , and there are types of missions that would be very important for us . 
We must ensure that we address that particular resource , especially the need for which our allies often call upon us to take part in . 
We need to pay special attention to the rapid deployment of our soldiers . 
To that end , we would establish an airborne unit and equip it with the appropriate helicopters . 
As I said earlier , it is a shame that we had not dealt with the Sea King earlier . 
It should have been dealt with a long time ago . 
Additionally , to fulfill our role as peacekeepers and peacemakers , we need to be able to deploy and sustain a brigade overseas . 
That is something as we have seen in recent years that has been a real challenge given the current numbers in our armed forces . 
We also need to be able to replace old equipment with appropriate new equipment . 
I spoke a little about that before . 
We should also recruit more individuals into the ranks of the army . 
That proud tradition is something we have to instill again . 
We have to share that proud tradition with more Canadians when it comes to our armed forces , the work they have done over our history and the work they continue to do . 
We need to have all Canadians respect and cherish that and actually want to see that commitment remain strong . 
Unfortunately that is something which I do not think the government has done well in promoting , for Canadians to be proud of that work and sustain that work of our men and women in the armed forces . 
Moving to the air force , we need to modernize our fleet of CF-18s and the Aurora aircraft so they can work side by side with our allies . 
We need to look at the future , including participating in the joint strike fighter project with the U.K. and the U.S.A. We also need a heavy strategic airlift capability to move personnel and equipment throughout Canada and around the globe . 
As I said , given the challenges we are facing in the coming years , especially if we want to maintain our role as significant peacekeepers around the world , that is something we need to address immediately . 
The final part of the military I would like to address is the navy . 
This is another area about which we have heard different stories . 
Clearly we need to look at the facts of what has happened and see how we can address them to improve the condition of our navy . 
Personnel need to be increased immediately so our ships are no longer understaffed and strained to the limit . 
We have seen that in recent rotations in Afghanistan .  It has been a big personnel problem . 
We need a proper fleet of submarines to maintain our sovereignty in the north , but also to be deployed whenever they are needed . 
The recommendations we have made would have us increase the numbers by three subs on each coast . 
As well , our ships and the actual equipment supporting them are getting old . 
We need to replace them and expand the fleet by at least four ships . 
That is evident by what happened recently in Afghanistan where we had to bring one of our ships back home because of the challenges it had while it was at sea . 
I already talked about the Sea King helicopters . 
There is no excuse ; those should be replaced immediately . 
I have talked about the record of the government . 
I have made recommendations . 
Obviously we on this side are supporting Bill C-37 because we want to continue to make that commitment to our armed personnel and our defence forces . 
It is something we cannot neglect and we need to be able to support that . 
I want to end on a positive note and share a personal story which I have shared before in the House . 
It is about the pride that many people feel , whether they are recent Canadians or whether their families have had longstanding traditions in the military . 
My family was fortunate enough to come to Canada in the early 1970s . 
I was only a baby . 
We were kicked out of a country , Uganda , and we were able to flee as refugees to Canada . 
Canada welcomed us with open arms and gave us the freedom and opportunities where , 25 years after coming here , a son of refugee parents is able to sit in the House of Commons , debate policy and basically try to improve our nation 's abilities and become respected internationally . 
Canada gave us this opportunity . 
There is always a real respect from people coming to Canada for its role which people have seen and heard about around the world : leading peacekeeping , leading freedom fighting missions , helping other countries and allies , and helping countries in need . 
Canada demonstrated that to our family when we came here . 
Even though Canada was not involved in a military role in Uganda , it still had troops helping out to make sure people could get out and safely come to Canada . 
That sort of pride is something I grew up with and heard about from my family , even though we were not directly involved in the freedom that our military forces over history have provided Canadians prior to our coming here . 
We need to instill that pride in future generations and to Canadians who see the work that can be done and the leadership that can be provided by our men and women in the armed forces . 
I am proud to be able to speak to their accomplishments up to now . 
This particular bill is a small step forward and will deal with the pension changes for our men and women in the forces . 
Let us look forward . 
Let us actually make the commitments that are required to continue to make people like myself and other Canadians proud of our military tradition , and to be able to meet those requirements that they are going to have in the future . 
Let us hope the government will listen to some of the recommendations we have made . 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey -- White Rock -- Langley , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate my colleague on an excellent speech on this issue . 
I have visited Borden which is a training facility for the Canadian armed forces . 
I was very impressed with the various aspects of training that our armed forces do , not only young people but a lot of people who in mid-life decide to look at the armed forces as a place of employment . 
Does my colleague think that the federal government should put more resources into the aspect of training Canadians , both young and older ? 
Should it use that element of federal responsibility to make sure that we get an educated population who can use it not only when they are employed by the armed forces but when they go back to civilian life ? 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer : 
Mr. Speaker , my colleague from South Surrey -- White Rock -- Langley is absolutely right . 
We could do a lot more when it comes to the federal government 's position as I spoke about to try to instill some pride , to try to engage Canadians in getting involved with our military . 
The member is absolutely right that there needs to be some effort made by the government especially in targeting certain parts of the population . 
I remember that while growing up , aside from learning in school about our military history , there was not really an effort made at the school level to recruit young people into the reserve forces or even into the armed forces . 
That has started to be done relatively recently . 
We could do a lot more of that , especially in Edmonton where a base is located . 
I have spoken to a lot of the young men and women who are serving there . 
They have said that is something they would like to see happen , to have more government effort made to raise the ranks of younger people getting involved in the military , to some extent in serving our nation . 
We saw a sharp rise in that after the attacks of 9/11 . 
More people were wanting to get involved to learn more about our military history and to prepare themselves in case there were any potential attacks even here in Canada . 
People would be more equipped to deal with certain unfortunate situations that would arise from an attack . 
Clearly the interest is there among Canadians . 
We need to encourage it from the federal government level . 
We need to target certain groups in schools and in other areas to consider getting involved even on a voluntary basis with the military . 
That is something the government could focus on to bring that pride and tradition back to our military . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney -- Alouette , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , our military personnel do an outstanding job defending freedom around the world . 
Our military has done an outstanding job here at home , especially when called on during emergency situations as we saw most recently with the fires that happened in Kelowna , British Columbia . 
We know that the Liberals have underfunded the military for 10 years . 
The military needs the resources . 
It needs the funding in order to do the job properly . 
That funding needs to be increased obviously . 
The Alliance has called for increased funding for a long time and the government has ignored that . 
I ask my colleague to comment on the funding aspect of the military and what the Liberals have done by neglecting their responsibility to adequately fund the military . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank my colleague from Dewdney -- Alouette for his most appropriate question . 
The debate we are having today is about the condition of our armed forces and especially the condition of our soldiers when it comes to their pension requirements and especially when it comes to the problems of funding that we find ourselves in because of the lack of commitment from government members over the last 10 years . 
I talked in my speech about the funding cuts that we have seen , unfortunately . 
The government has been scrambling over the years to try to increase some of the funding in certain areas that have been hit so hard . 
When it comes to the way the military men and women can do their jobs , in spite of the government , they still do a great job . 
Specifically when we look at the record of the soon to be prime minister who was the former finance minister during the time of the majority of the cuts to defence , close to $ 20 billion which I identified in my speech were taken out of the military budget . 
That is incredible . 
How can we expect the military that is so revered around the world to meet the commitments on a daily basis , let alone on an international basis with our commitments with our allies , with the incredible cut to that particular funding ? 
Now we are seeing a complete flip-flop by the soon to be prime minister saying that he has a strong commitment to the military and he is going to make that a priority . 
Where was he over the last 10 years when he was in charge of signing those cheques ? 
He was absent as he is usually in some of the debates that we are having . 
Clearly , if the government is going to talk about the military and talk about its commitment to defence , my hon. colleague has it right . 
The government sure has not demonstrated it over the last 10 years . 
I question the new prime minister 's motives when he talks about the idea of committing to the military . 
How in fact can we trust him to do that ? 
He has talked the talk before but he sure did not walk the walk . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is important to recognize the lack of resources that have gone into the military over the last several years . 
This is all about choices . 
Decisions have to be made about where we want to spend money . 
A good example is the well noted $ 20 billion shortfall and that is one-twentieth of the long gun registry . 
What choices would my colleague suggest be made to allow those resources to go to the military ? 
For example , we are in the stage of tax cuts of $ 50 billion or $ 100 billion . 
What other suggestions does he have for getting those resources to our military personnel and also the equipment that they need ? 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank my colleague from Windsor West for his most appropriate question . 
I would like to congratulate him for his diligence in fighting for customs agents in and around the Windsor area and security at our borders . 
We have worked together on a couple of other issues as well . 
He hit the nail on the head when he talked about priorities . 
Let us talk about the government 's priorities and how it has spent Canadians ' money . 
We can identify a number of what we on this side of the House call boondoggles when it comes to how the government spent Canadians ' money . 
It could do so much more good if its priorities were set straight . 
If the Liberals ' priorities are vote buying , clearly that is something they are masters of and they have done very well . 
We can talk about things like the gun registry and things like corporate welfare where the Liberals have given millions of dollars to their friends in various companies depending on who they are .  We can talk about sponsorship grants . 
How much abuse do taxpayers have to take before they wake up and tell the government to be accountable for what it is doing ? 
The hon. member mentioned the gun registry . 
If we took those resources and put them into something that Canadians feel strongly about , our military for example , there would be overwhelming support to do that over some of the government 's shameful priorities . 
Mr. Serge Marcil ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not exactly have a question ; it is more of a comment . 
First , I am very pleased to see that the hon. members of the opposition will be supporting this bill . 
In my opinion , this is a positive gesture toward the people who represent us in so many corners of the world . 
But their speeches are a bit beyond me . 
To listen to the hon. members , one would think we needed three more submarines here , four more ships there , 20 CF-18s somewhere else , and so on . 
I think they are completely out of touch with Canada . 
Canadians are not known as a nation of warriors . 
Canada is a country that uses its defence and military capabilities for peace throughout the world . 
Perhaps the hon. members should consider the role we wish to give our soldiers . 
They should not limit themselves to the rhetoric of `` warriors '' -- the word is a bit stronger than I would like -- people who would like Canadians to be equipped with the same highly developed weapons as the Americans , which would fit neatly into the American military , because their goal is more one of military intervention . 
We have a different goal . 
They should perhaps tone down the rhetoric . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is missing the point when it comes to resourcing our military . 
We are not talking about building up an arms race or trying to compete with other countries that are obviously positioned in a superpower status . 
We are talking about what Canada can do well in its role as a middle power and one that has been respected around the world , especially when it comes to peacekeeping and when it comes to being prepared in combat ready situations to help our allies . 
That is what we are talking about . 
Even in doing what the armed forces have done so well over the years , the government has failed in resourcing our armed forces . 
The hon. member should take some responsibility for that because that is what we are debating today . 
Even though the government has taken a small step with Bill C-37 , ultimately we still have a host of issues that are affecting our military . 
Those issues need to be addressed by the government . 
I do not know whether it will do that leading into the next election . 
It has failed the military up until now and I do not expect it to turn any new corner to help it out in the future . 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey -- White Rock -- Langley , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will not take much time . 
I would be remiss if I did not put some comments on the record . 
I have listened with interest to not only what my colleagues have said , but also to the questions or comments coming from across the floor . 
I think Canadians need to understand that Bill C-37 is just one small attempt to rectify one small problem in a very large issue ; that is the government 's lack of support for the Canadian military . 
This is not something new . 
I think if Canadians put their minds back to Liberal governments over the past , it has been a consistent ploy of Liberal governments , present and past , to undermine and underfund the Canadian military . 
It seems to me it was a Liberal cabinet minister who at one time thought he would put all the divisions of the military under one umbrella and take away the pride in being navy , air force or army . 
That did not bode well . 
The problem in the past with the Liberal government is that it does it without any kind of understanding of what the armed forces are , any debate with Canadians as to what Canadians want and it does it for political purposes , not for logical and reasonable purposes . 
Decisions that have made with the present Liberal government have only shown that things have not changed and are not likely to change . 
I come from a constituency in British Columbia , the province which is most likely to have an earthquake . 
It is the province that had forest fires during the summer because of our large forested areas , and it suffers from these fires . 
B.C. has mountains and rivers and is often subject to floods . 
There is a real need , not only in British Columbia , but in Quebec , in Atlantic Canada and in Canada 's north for a strong military support for domestic reasons . 
It does not always have to be international concerns . 
However for domestic concerns and events , it would be a great thing to have a strong military presence . 
The land forces base in the lower mainland was closed , not for logical reasons but for political reasons . 
I talked with a gentleman who sat on the committee when it was reviewing the military bases across Canada . 
He told me that Chilliwack was not even on the list . 
It was not even recommended that it be closed . 
However that decision was made between Quebec City and Ottawa . 
It was a political decision , with no logical background . 
That is reality . 
The Liberal government may be concerned that Canadians will find out why these decisions were made . 
However , the point is the Chilliwack base was closed . 
If there were a major earthquake , the airport would not be usable because it happens to be in a part of Richmond that would probably be soup , if it existed at all . 
How in heaven 's name is any military presence going to get to where it is most needed ? 
I want to suggest that it is time for the next government to really focuses on what Canadians want from their military . 
Canadians do want our Canadian military to do a peacekeeping role , but they want much more than that . 
Canadians want our Canadian military to provide protection for their own country . 
They want the Canadian military to have the resources to provide domestic responses . 
I would suggest that Canadians would like to see our military be a place where our young people could find not only employment , but service to their country . 
As a result of finding service to their country , of giving some of themselves to Canada , in return they would get training which they could use when they left the military . 
The federal government should be doing something to help our young people with education . 
It should not be giving away millions and millions of dollars for an elite few . 
It should be providing a training ground for many young people who cannot get into the university system . 
That is a role the Canadian government can play and should play through our military resources . 
I am another voice that says the government has neglected our Canadian military . 
When it wants to cut its budget , where is the first place it goes ? 
It is increasing rents to our military personnel who are serving their country . 
It is reducing the budget for materials and training that they need . 
The Canadian military is the first place the Liberal government goes to cut its budget ; that and health care . 
It is time for Canadians to stand up and indicate that this is not good enough and is not acceptable . 
Hon. David Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I hate to sit here on a Monday afternoon and have my colleague across the way subject the House to some misinformation . 
The fact is the Reform Party at the time was fully in agreement with the major budgetary cuts the government made in 1994-95 . 
Canadian Forces base Chilliwack was one that was certainly a candidate for closure . 
She states that because Chilliwack is no longer operational , in the case of disaster this will be awful for British Columbia . 
We just went through a disaster with the forest fires and the fact is 2,000 defence personnel participated in fighting those fires . 
They had no problem getting into the interior of British Columbia and many of them came from the naval base at Esquimalt . 
Also , there are thousands of troops , as the hon. member from Edmonton just stated , based in Edmonton . 
The hon. member should know that in this day and age we can quickly transport troops by helicopter or by plane to various parts of Canada when there are dire emergencies . 
Whether it was the floods in the Saguenay , or the floods in the Red River , or the forest fires this year or , as the Minister of National Defence said this afternoon , in the case of any requirement being made by the government of British Columbia for the current flooding in B.C. , the Canadian military is there and will be able to get on the job . 
Ms. Val Meredith : 
Mr. Speaker , I assume that was a statement as opposed to a question because I did not hear a question . 
My response to that is this . 
I talked to an individual who said that he sat on the committee that was recommending those selections . 
I have to say that there was no reason that he would misinform me or that he would lead me astray . 
I have no reason to doubt that information was accurate . 
If the minister is not aware of what happened when he was defence minister , that is not my problem . 
That is his problem . 
As far as -- 
Hon. David Collenette : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
The hon. member has questioned what I have just said . 
I was the minister at the time and I knew what was happening . 
I knew which bases were on the list . 
That is why we made the information -- 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
That is not really a point of order . 
It is debate . 
Let us give an opportunity for the hon. member for South Surrey -- White Rock -- Langley to answer the comment . 
Ms. Val Meredith : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to continue by saying there have been many occasions when the roads have been closed between Alberta and British Columbia . 
Unless the minister has not been out there lately , there are many mountain ranges between Edmonton and Vancouver . 
There are many times when if it is not avalanches , it is mud slides or rock slides that close those areas to land transportation . 
I repeat that if there were a major event in the lower mainland because of an earthquake and the airport was underground , they would be hard pressed to get any help there . 
It is also a situation where there are many marine incidents and the U.S. coast guard comes to the aid of Canadians in distress because our Canadian navy does not have the response vessel . 
Because the Coast Guard is underfunded as well , the American coast guard is called upon to help Canadians in distress in our area . 
I think the government shows a real lack of knowledge and a lack of respect of the Canadian armed forces when it is trying to convince Canadians that all is well . 
All is not well and it is time the government acknowledged it . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , one of the underlying themes that we have been discussing , and I would like to get the hon. member 's opinion on this , is we have a number of different issues stacking up in the military , be it helicopters , ships , planes or jeeps . 
Not only am I concerned with this issue , but I am concerned with the history of the government over the last 10 years on other hard infrastructure , whether it be bridges , roads , water treatment plants or other infrastructure issues , which have been left to derelict for so long . 
I am concerned that young Canadians who enter the workforce later in life , who have a more difficult time securing full time employment and saving for the future will have to pay for this with limited resources . 
How does she feels about this situation ? 
Ms. Val Meredith : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my hon. colleague for giving me an opportunity to expound my feelings on infrastructure . 
I have long let it be known how I feel about the government taking gasoline taxes from provinces and not returning them by putting them back into transportation infrastructure . 
I would suggest that the government is reneging on its responsibilities by taxing Canadians . 
A number of years ago the former finance minister added 3 % taxation on gasoline to bring the debt under control and to balance the budget . 
However that 3 % is still there and it is not being used for infrastructure . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
I remind the hon. member that we are dealing with veterans ' pensions . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George -- Peace River , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , given the comments and the heckling from the Minister of Transport today , no wonder the Liberals do so poorly in every election in British Columbia . 
For him to heckle , as we heard earlier , and for him to brag that he made the decision to kill the base in Chilliwack for cost efficiency , which provided no land base regular force presence in mainland British Columbia , is absolutely unbelievable . 
However it does show , perhaps , why one of the decisions of the soon to be former prime minister to remove the member as the minister of national defence during the Somali debacle , to demote him and eventually give him the crumb of Minister of Transport was probably -- 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
I am sorry to interrupt but the member is really going on a slide . 
If the hon. member for South Surrey -- White Rock -- Langley wants to add anything , there is about a minute and a half left , but on the matter that preoccupies us , please . 
Ms. Val Meredith : 
Mr. Speaker , the issues being raised are the reasons why Canadians in western Canada are hesitant to put their support behind a Liberal government . 
There is a lack of response and understanding of our concerns . 
The government cannot understand that British Columbians have this thing hanging over their heads called earthquake alley . 
We are concerned about the ability of emergency services to respond to a serious earthquake in the lower mainland , where millions of people live . 
That is not an unrealistic concern . 
The fact is we know from past experience that the mountains cause a barrier . 
As good as the base might be in Edmonton and as good as the people are , we are concerned they may not be able to get to us . 
That is a very real concern . 
The fact that the government does not understand and refuses to understand should concern all western Canadians . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney -- Alouette , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I too must add a few comments in this debate given where we have just gone and where we need to go yet on this topic . 
I will not promise to take a long time , because we do not know how this debate will evolve a little later . 
I do want to add my comments of support for the military . 
I think it is a good thing that we are moving forward with this bill . 
I am the son of a veteran . 
My father was in the forces during World War II as a member of the navy . 
I saw first-hand from him the commitment that he made during that period of time and , something I have mentioned in the House before and will mention again , I saw the scars he lived with as a result of making the decision to contribute to the freedom not only of our country but of the world at that time . 
It is a price one pays that can really never be measured . 
We need to uphold and support our veterans and we need to give adequate resources to our current personnel in all the tasks they are undertaking , whether here at home or abroad . 
I want to mention Chilliwack because it did come up in debate . 
I have to point out to the minister that Chilliwack is not far from my own riding . 
It is about a 45 minute drive from my own hometown . 
I have to point out the geography of the lower mainland and elaborate on my colleague 's point , because we do have some serious concerns in British Columbia . 
Should there be a major earthquake in that area , we have limited heavy lift capability within our forces . 
If there is a major earthquake , even if the equipment could be brought over from Edmonton , where are those planes going to land ? 
On this question , I am astounded that this was brought up by the minister as well . 
My colleague , our critic for defence , brought up the point that the minister was bragging about closing down Chilliwack . 
That has had a serious impact on people 's concerns about what would happen should there be a major disaster such as an earthquake in the lower mainland or in B.C. It is a question that simply has not been answered , which points out and highlights the fact that the Liberals have starved our military of adequate resources and funding for the past 10 years during which they have been in power . 
Military spending needs to be increased . 
There was no commitment from the former finance minister when he was in cabinet for 10 years . 
As my colleague from Edmonton mentioned earlier , how can we possibly trust him to follow through as the next prime minister on commitments he is talking about now in regard to increasing military spending ? 
I would say to Canadians that we cannot . 
I would say to look at the previous record ; it will indicate future performance . 
On that point , the next leader of the Liberal Party fails woefully because of his record in that regard . 
I simply want to point out again that in this debate we appreciate the opportunity to talk about our military personnel and we want to commend them for the job they do , often under very difficult circumstances and with limited resources . 
They do an outstanding job and we are proud of our Canadian Forces personnel . 
We are not proud of our government and the way that it has cut the military 's funding for 10 years and made its job tougher and tougher to do . 
It has extended the military in so many ways and in so many different places without giving it the resources that are required to do the job properly . 
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan -- Shuswap , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member has raised a number of concerns . 
With regard to what he was saying about Canadian Forces Base Chilliwack in British Columbia being closed down , I believe that was the last land base in British Columbia for the armed forces . 
Scientists have proven that sooner or later there will be a major earthquake in the Hope region , possibly between Hope and Chilliwack or maybe just a bit above Hope , which is not very far from Vancouver . 
We have seen the devastation of the fires this summer and now we see the devastation of the floods , yet we have no emergency response team from the forces . 
We no longer have a land base out there . 
With all these cutbacks , I must say that I find it very worrisome that the Government of Canada would totally disregard the fact that a province the size of British Columbia has no emergency response team or actually no help there . 
The nearest help would have to come from Edmonton . 
In some cases , we would be looking at 24 to 48 hours . 
Anyone who has been in a flood or a fire or who has ever witnessed an earthquake knows that is a long time . 
What does the hon. member think about that situation ? 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously the closure of Chilliwack has caused grave concern throughout British Columbia and the Vancouver region , where millions of people live . 
I will make the point again that there is heavy equipment in Edmonton , yes , but should there be an earthquake it is going to be awfully tough to transport that equipment through mountains if the roads are blocked or wiped out . 
The airports where those planes would land , should we be able to get them in , possibly also are going to be damaged by any earthquake . 
I think it was simply a wrong-headed decision to close Chilliwack . 
It showed a lack of foresight . 
It showed a lack of looking at the big picture for the entire country , respecting all regions of the country and looking at what was required for the province of British Columbia . 
We hate to say `` we told you so '' after the fact , because damage that could be done to property and lives is something from which there could never be a recovery . 
We hope and pray that the situation will not occur , but a decision was taken by the government and , should something happen , it will be responsible for that decision . 
It would be unfortunate , but being in government means making decisions and having to live with the decisions that are made . 
This is one decision which the government should admit was wrong , rather than continuing to try to defend it all these years later . 
It has done the same thing with the Sea Kings , as has been mentioned today , helicopters that are as old as I am . 
They are 41 years old ; I guess I am giving away my age . 
Again , this government has defended cancelling a contract 10 years ago , a contract that would have seen those helicopters replaced , rather than admitting it made a mistake and that it needs to get on with ordering the appropriate equipment . 
The government will not do that , just like it will not do that with the decision it made about Chilliwack . 
That is unfortunate . 
What are Canadians left with ? 
Let us look at another alternative . 
Let us look at replacing this group that refuses to admit it has made mistakes and bad decisions that have affected all Canadians . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
On veterans ' pensions ? 
The hon. member for Prince George -- Peace River . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George -- Peace River , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not sure whether it is appropriate for the Speaker to call relevance . 
I think that normally it is left to other members to make that assessment and bring the Speaker 's attention to it . 
The fact of the matter is that part of Bill C-37 deals with changes to the superannuation act governing not only our regular forces now , but with the changes to the reserves , and it deals with quality of life issues . 
I referred to that during my remarks , as did the Minister of National Defence . 
I note that this is at the bottom of some of the comments being made by my colleague from Dewdney -- Alouette . 
Unfortunately , what we have seen from this Liberal government over the past decade is a decline in the quality of life of the people who serve and are willing to put their lives on the line for us , not only overseas but in meeting domestic emergencies here as well . 
During question period today , I asked the government a question that really drives home this point . 
At a time like this , when our men and women are fully engaged in the war on terror , many either going to or returning from deployment overseas , there is great anxiety and worry about loved ones , about whether they will even return and what they will be subjected to while they are overseas . 
When all of this is going on in the lives of these young families , they are being subjected as of November 1 to yet another rent increase for housing on bases across the nation . 
In many cases , this housing is in deplorable condition ; it is substandard and well below what we would assess as appropriate . 
I wonder if my colleague would comment , because he referred to the fact that all of these changes happened under the watch of the member for LaSalle -- Émard , the former finance minister . 
These cuts were made by him .  They affected the quality of life of every man , woman and child in our Canadian armed forces families and they continue to affect them adversely . 
I , like the member for Dewdney -- Alouette , am greatly concerned about the hypocrisy of that member at this point . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , Bill C-37 does talk about quality of life issues . 
My colleague asks a question about the next leader of the Liberal Party , the former finance minister . 
In essence , he asks how the former minister can be trusted to ensure that the quality of life issues for our military are improved under his watch when he has been responsible , in large part , for the quality of life problems facing our military personnel right now . 
I have said before , and I will say it again , that his past record should be an indicator to people about future performance . 
Given his past record I would say that his future performance will be very poor in this regard and that Canadians should not trust everything he says , which is that he has all the solutions to all problems , because it is simply untrue . 
Our military needs to know that should the Alliance have the honour of governing this country , not only have we continued to say that the military will be a priority , but we will make the military a priority in the ways that we have laid out . 
We will be committed to that because it is the right thing to do . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to make an observation about something I am familiar with , because I have a son in the military service . 
Although that military is the United States military , I want to let the member know that I have made some comparisons because I have had other opportunities to visit the military throughout Canada . 
My son has been in the military for approximately 10 years . 
He was at different bases throughout the United States during his training . 
He is at present in Iraq .  His family is living in housing at a military base in Germany . 
At all times during his years when he had his family , they had housing . 
He had two children and a wife in Fort Stewart and Fort Lewis , Washington . 
His mother and I managed to visit him on a number of occasions . 
The housing was excellent . 
If it was on a base , it was free . 
If it was off base , it was subsidized . 
He was given a supplement to help pay for their needs . 
All these things were well looked after . 
It provides parents some comfort when they know that their child -- 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
I am sorry , but there is no time left on the clock . 
I will give the hon. member for Dewdney -- Alouette a minute to respond , if he wishes . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , I will simply sum up by saying that my colleague from Wild Rose is one the hardest working members of Parliament . 
Whatever his critic 's role is , he travels the country , whether it is in his role as Solicitor General critic , when he travels to visit the prisons , or whether it is in working with the Indian affairs department , when he visits across the country talking to people . 
He knows what he is talking about , and in this situation he is talking about his own family . 
He has highlighted the fact that when a government makes something a priority , like the United States has with military housing , it makes a difference , and that if our government were to do that it would make a difference in the lives of our personnel here at home . 
It needs to be done . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Bélair ) : 
Pursuant to Standing Order 38 , it is my duty to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Windsor West , Public safety ; the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre , Health . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure , on behalf of the New Democratic Party , to speak to Bill C-37 , an act to amend the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts . 
One of the most important themes of the bill is that it would improve the quality of life of those individuals who serve in our military and , whether they are reservists or not , they have the right and entitlement to pursue good employment and living standards . 
The bill would assist them in their pensionable earnings and give them a higher quality of life once their service is completed . 
I would like to touch on a recent experience that hammers home the importance for us to show leadership and support for our military personnel . 
I attended the recent commissioning of HMCS Windsor in Halifax , the submarine that will soon go on its first mission to the Bahamas . 
I was there to show my support for our men and women in service who will be putting themselves at risk . 
Our community is steadfastly behind them and supporting them , whether it be in correspondence , in goods or in having them come to our city if they cannot be with the submarine itself to view it themselves , so that quality of life is enhanced . 
The pensionable improvement in the bill shows that we can as a country afford things that will instill confidence and provide some sense of security in our military personnel . 
That has been lacking . 
When we look at quality of life we define it in many different ways . 
It could be housing for example . 
We have heard a lot of discourse about the housing conditions for our men and women in the service and what they have to endure on the bases and that their involvement in terms of creating their own communities is often not ideal . 
They do not have the standard of living that we should be proud of as Canadians . 
We know we can do better but we have not . 
I believe we have been making the wrong choices on where to allocate our resources . 
That is a simple thing we can do to increase the quality of life of our service personnel living in those residences . 
Pay is another issue , although when people enter the service their number one priority for entering is not necessarily the pay but that they want to serve their country and ensure that we have freedom and democracy , not only here but around the world . 
However the pay is something that is important because they have families and their families depend upon having earners who will provide the means so that they can make choices in the future . 
Whether it be a different education path , experiences , family vacations , personal growth , investments or opportunities , they need those aspects behind them . 
That certainly has not happened in the past 10 years in terms of the amount that they have been receiving . 
It certainly should be more and we have been supporting that . 
The government has shown that it has not done a good job of providing the right infrastructure investments . 
We know for a fact that there are helicopters , ships , jeeps and planes that we have to look at in terms of the cost that we will have to pay to provide the right tools and resources . 
I know we discussed the fact that we are not a superpower like the United States . 
I do not think Canadians are comparing themselves to that . 
They are asking for a government that will provide the adequate support , equipment and tools so that people can be trained , have good morale and we can actually have an element of pride coming not only from the people serving but also from the citizens who are backing them . 
That leadership has been lacking . 
We should not be looking at item after item and what is coming up . 
We should be showing some leadership , but I do not think that has happened . 
We have made those choices . 
The former minister of finance decided to provide $ 100 billion worth of tax cuts . 
We wonder where the money is coming from . 
We know where it went . 
We will need to make some very difficult decisions because we have lost those revenues and resources . 
I think the choices should have been different , and this is a good example . 
The pension funds would provide people with some confidence and , I believe , convince youth to enlist and members of the forces to stay in the service because there will be amendments . 
It is quite correctly noted that the improvement in pension benefits is driven to some extent by the desire not only to improve the quality of persons currently serving in the Canadian Forces but to assist in the recruitment of new personnel . 
I think that is important . 
I have spoken a number of times about the challenges youth will face because of the lack of direction we have had over the last 10 years . 
Our youth are concerned about pensions . 
Many people who are currently employed have vulnerable pensions , such as the employees at Air Canada and other corporations where pensions have not been funded correctly . 
We have another group of young Canadians , which goes directly to this issue , coming out of school a lot later in life and more in debt . 
Because they begin working later in life their pensionable earning years will be greatly reduced , which creates a challenging environment for them . 
They may not have a sustainable pension to retire early and live out their dreams . 
Like most Canadians , after working hard they want to retire with dignity . 
I believe it is important for the bill to provide more security because young people will be faced with this issue more and more . 
It is quite a sleeper out there because we have not seen the first wave through , and we will . 
Over the next 20 years we will see a lot of vulnerable people who will not have the years needed for an appropriate pension . 
The bill would certainly be an improvement . 
However the bill does raise a couple of questions about the pensions and the way they will be set up . 
It deals with how the government has handled the whole Canadian pension fund . 
We know for a fact that 30 % of these funds can go overseas for investment . 
The other funds will be invested in Canada . 
The government will not agree to an ethics screen or a green screen on where those pensionable earnings go . 
Quite literally , we could have men and women , who have paid into the pension plan , go to places where they have either served against regimes or have seen terrible situations with human rights issues . 
We do not know , because they only have to report back once every two years to the Minister of Finance himself . 
I do not believe that is an acceptable situation . 
We need to show confidence . 
According to the new section 25(4) of the act as amended by clause 15 , it states that if a contributor with two or more years of pensionable service dies , the survivor and children will receive the annual allowances . 
After 10 years or more of pensionable service , individuals released from the military for health reasons because they are no longer able to perform their duties would be entitled to an immediate pension . 
I congratulate the government and all members of the House who support this because this builds confidence . 
We can do things that make sense and that give confidence . 
At the same time we have to battle it out , like the VI program for veterans ' widows who do not get the support they need to keep them in their homes . 
It is actually a saving to the whole system but the government cannot find the funds to do that . 
We have a bill here where we can find the funds , which is a good thing , but why can we not find the funds for other things ? 
I will conclude by saying that this is a small positive step forward . 
I will not get into all the other different things on which we have wasted our money . 
If governments make the right decisions and invest in people , instead of tax cuts , we can build a nation that will be much better off in the future . 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this has been a fairly broad ranging debate today . 
The member talked about investing in people . 
I have been concerned about the way the military itself has dealt with the reserves and the cadets . 
Both of those are very much people organizations of the military in terms of pension type support and other support . 
Would my colleague care to comment on the role of the reserves and the cadets and , in particular , how they are treated by the military hierarchy ? 
Mr. Brian Masse : 
Mr. Speaker , my hon. colleague 's question relates to an individual employed in my office , Mr. Andrew Sadler , who is part of that whole situation between reserves and cadets . 
He has done a great job of adding that component to his life , and that expertise has helped the service of my office by far . 
This individual has had the opportunity to participate , to make choices and to build friendships , not only in the place where he lived but in our local constituency . 
I believe the reserves and cadets deserve proper respect and encouragement that can build the nation . 
For young individuals to be involved in an organization from the grassroots all the way to the top is very important . 
It builds a long established relationship of protocol and an understanding of history . 
As a former city councillor the one thing I have seen is that our municipal services lost a number of very experienced individuals who retired early because of cuts and downloading . 
We lost their mentorship and a world of knowledge . 
Where I believe we can be really effective in terms of having not only highly trained professionals but a competent and very informed group of people in the reserves and cadets is by providing them with better opportunities so we can prosper as a nation . 
I think they would add a lot more to the nation if they were given the opportunities . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
Is the House ready for the question ? 
Some hon. members : Question . 
The Deputy Speaker : The question is on the motion . 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
Some hon. members : Agreed . 
( Motion agreed to , bill read the third time and passed ) 
Statistics Act 
Hon. Elinor Caplan 
( for the Minister of Industry ) moved : that Bill S-13 , an act to amend the Statistics Act be read the second time and referred to a committee . 
Mr. Serge Marcil ( Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to present Bill S-13 , an act to amend the Statistics Act , for second reading today . 
Bill S-13 is of interest to many of our constituents . 
Historical census records are a key tool for historical researchers and genealogists and remain the most commonly used records in family and historical research . 
There has been much debate over the last few years about access to the post-1901 historical census records . 
I am sure that you have all received correspondence or seen media articles on this matter . 
Bill S-13 provides reasonable access to historical census records and meets the needs of genealogists and historians for information on their families and communities . 
The bill also puts appropriate safeguards in place to protect the privacy of individuals . 
Bill S-13 achieves an acceptable balance of these two competing public goods . 
I am pleased that a solution has been found to the difficult problem of balancing access to our historical census records with protecting the privacy of Canadians . 
The underlying problem regarding historical census records is that there has been legal ambiguity about the confidential status of historical census records . 
As such , Bill S-13 is designed to remove the legal ambiguity that currently exists with post-1901 census records . 
First of all , I would like to explain to the House why this legislation does not cover the 1906 census records . 
The government released the 1906 census without restriction on January 24 , 2003 . 
The 1906 census records were released without condition given the special nature of that census . 
Only tombstone information was collected and the 1906 census was limited to three provinces -- Manitoba , Saskatchewan and Alberta . 
Unlike the 1906 census , the 1911 and subsequent censuses contain very sensitive information . 
The purpose of Bill S-13 is to make the 1911 and later census records available for historical and genealogical research . 
The bill would allow historians and genealogists to have access to historical census records , under certain conditions , beginning 92 years after the census took place . 
The census records would become available without restriction after 112 years . 
The bill also seeks to clarify the position with respect to future census records by asking respondents to consent to the eventual release of their information . 
The bill contains a provision to allow Canadians , beginning with the 2006 census. to consent to the eventual public release of their personal census information , 92 years later . 
Some of you may question why there are conditions attached to the release of these historical census records , while others may say that these records should be permanently closed to protect the privacy of Canadians . 
Bill S-13 is a compromise . 
As in any compromise , there has been give and take . 
Bill S-13 represents ground given on the access side and ground given on the protection side by both the Chief Statistician of Canada and the National Archivist . 
On the protection side , informed consent by Canadians will govern the release of future censuses starting with the 2006 census . 
On the release side , it is unrestricted access after 112 years for censuses taken between 1911 and 2001 . 
Bill S-13 provides genealogists and historical researchers with access for genealogical , scholarly , cultural or educational purposes beginning 92 years after the census took place . 
After 112 years , the records will be fully released . 
Wile this legislation puts conditions on release of information for twenty years , it is important to have such safeguards in place to protect the privacy of Canadians . 
In fact , this legislation goes beyond the Privacy Act and provides an additional 20 years of privacy protection . 
One of the most important sections in Bill S-13 is its provision for Canadians to give informed consent to the release of their census information in the future . 
Starting with the 2006 census , Canadians will be asked to decide if they will allow their personal census information to be released publically after 92 years . 
Individual census records would be released only where consent is given . 
To allow Canadians to decide in future censuses whether others can have access to their personal census records is in keeping with the highest standards of privacy protection . 
This is the heart of the compromise as it will ensure the willing cooperation of Canadians with future censuses which is so essential for a successful census . 
This continued trust by Canadians is a cornerstone of Statistics Canada . 
I think it is fair to say that the bill meets the needs of historians and genealogists while protecting the privacy of Canadians . 
In summary , the bill will permit access to the 1911 to 2001 census records , 92 years after a census was taken . 
Access will be subject to specific conditions . 
Genealogists , professional or amateur , or their authorized representatives would agree in advance that they would release only tombstone information pertaining to their own family members . 
Subject to this release condition , access for genealogical purposes would be unrestricted . 
Tombstone information is defined as name , address , age , sex , marital status , origin and occupation . 
Historical researchers would have the public and scientific nature of their proposed research confirmed by appropriate peers or community leaders prior to starting their work . 
Again , while access would be unrestricted , only tombstone information could be released . 
The conditions would be in effect for a 20-year period following the release of the historical census records 92 years after the census . 
After 112 years , the conditions would be removed , and access and release would be permitted . 
The bill will allow Canadians to decide , starting with the 2006 census , whether they allow their personal census information to be made publically available 92 years after the census . 
Starting with 2098 , access to 2006 census records would be made publically available only when consent has been given at the time of collection . 
Access to census records as specified in the legislation would be achieved by using existing access mechanisms of the Library and Archives of Canada , formerly known as the National Archives . 
These conditions are neither onerous nor restrictive for genealogists and historians . 
I would also like to assure the House that the legislative change in the Statistics Act does not impact on any of Statistic Canada 's other surveys . 
The census is the only survey where identifiable personal records are microfilmed or scanned and kept in perpetuity . 
In closing , I want to say that this bill is a reasonable compromise . 
As I mentioned at the start of my speech , this bill is a solution to the difficult problems of balancing access to our historical census records with protecting the privacy of Canadians . 
This bill fully ensures the integrity of census-keeping in Canada . 
It will ensure the public 's continued cooperation with and trust in Statistics Canada with regard to its censuses and other surveys . 
I ask the House to support this bill . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as correctly identified , Bill S-13 attempts to strike a balance between access to data and confidentiality . 
Well noted in the details was the concept of enlightened consent for 2006 . 
I was the chair of the complete count committee for Windsor and Essex County for the 2000 census . 
It was critical to get reliable data because as a country we make a lot of decisions about where we spend money and resources on census data . 
It was important that the data was very thorough , was very strong and was as good as it possibly could be . 
To do that , we had to build up public confidence . 
We had to go door to door , as one of six places in Ontario , to ensure that confidence , especially when we were dealing with multicultural communities where people who had come from abroad were being counted for the first time not only in numbers but also in very personal and sensitive information . 
Canadians in general are very concerned about privacy matters , whether they be in the government itself or outside in the private sector . 
My concern is about the way the government has handled the next stage of Canada 's census by outsourcing it to Lockheed Martin . 
I believe it would create a real crisis for Canadians to give information about themselves , their families and their lifestyles to a multinational arms manufacturing company that could quite literally have been responsible , if they had come from another country , for damaging their property , injuring them or killing a neighbour or a family friend with products that the company actually sells abroad to a number of different nations . 
My concern is that we would witness a slow erosion of the confidence . 
To instill that confidence again , will we cancel that contract that is due in 2004 by Lockheed Martin and do it in house ? 
It is not acceptable to say that we have no control over this because of NAFTA and the fact that it is an American multinational corporation that is an arms manufacturer and can bid just like anybody else . 
It does not have to do that because we can do it in house as we have done before . 
Will the parliamentary secretary work with me to ensure that Canadians are doing this job and that it is in house so we can restore the confidence in our census data ? 
Mr. Serge Marcil : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague from Windsor West for his question . 
Today we are debating a bill for the purpose of correcting a situation . 
Historians and genealogists will be given access to information for their family or others in order to put together material to show Canadians , or anyone else , 92 years later , the origins of people who were born or living in Canada with consent from the person participating in the census . 
If Canadians mistrust Statistics Canada or the company that might be conducting the census , they could simply sign a document indicating that they do not want this personal information to be disclosed until 112 years later . 
Let us not confuse the bill as it stands today , Bill S-13 , with the contract that has been awarded . 
Let us be clear that contracts awarded by the government are tendered . 
A statement of work is drafted and standards are followed . 
There are also well-disclosed selection criteria . 
It is open to everyone . 
Our legislation requires us , in North America and under NAFTA , to open our market to everyone . 
Calls for tenders cannot be limited strictly to Canadian or local firms . 
We are required to open our market . 
Signing an international agreement means that one agrees to respect the document and the conditions agreed to . 
In this case , I trust the Government of Canada . 
Calls for tenders have been made ; that is one thing . 
Today , what worries us specifically is the high number of citizens , genealogists and historians who have phoned me and whom I have met with in my office . 
I am sure that all parliamentarians have met with people in their office who asked , `` Why are we denied access to the famous 1901 census and the censuses for subsequent years ? '' 
At the time , disclosure standards were probably shorter to protect the privacy of Canadians . 
Now , we want to give historians and genealogists access to all the censuses , while ensuring that privacy is protected . 
We are telling people that nothing can be released before 112 years . 
To have information released after 92 years , consent will be required . 
It will be possible for individuals to consent to the release of tombstone information , such as name , sex , origin , occupation , after 92 years . 
This is the sole focus of the bill , which is redressing a certain inequity . 
Historians sometimes retrace the history of a region or village . 
Every year , there are villages celebrating their 125th , 150th or 200th anniversary , and we want to know who built these villages . 
Often , a local historian wants to find out who the founding families were , among other things . 
In order to retrace the history of a region , province , country or family , access to certain information is necessary . 
We are fortunate enough to have an organization by the name of Statistics Canada , which carries out censuses on a regular basis , so that the information is always up to date . 
Through this organization , historians and those interested in history can have access to such information . 
This is important , and this bill gives all these specialists access to this information while at the same time protecting the privacy of Canadians . 
Mr. Larry Bagnell ( Yukon , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry for an excellent speech on Bill S-13 . 
I want to state what the feedback has been from my constituents . 
I remember the first person was from the Porter Creek part of Whitehorse and was against the bill . 
That person was worried about privacy . 
All subsequent submissions since then have been in favour . 
The ones I remember were trying to research their family history . 
They have no way of doing that as early as would be required without the bill . 
It gives protection for 92 or 112 years , depending upon the situation . 
Is the parliamentary secretary confident that the bill protects the privacy of the first person I was talking about for sufficient time , but also allows people to do research on their family history ? 
Mr. Serge Marcil : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my hon. colleague for Yukon for his question . 
It is important that members of Parliament can ask questions in order to clarify a bill . 
Few people , in fact , even members of the public , read a bill or an act clause by clause . 
Instead we rely on experts , lawyers and other people . 
At least , here in the House , questions from the hon. members give the minister or the parliamentary secretary an opportunity for further explanation . 
Bill S-13 does , in fact , protect private information . 
If a person does not want private information released , as of the 2006 census , that person need only sign a form stating that this information is private and cannot be released until 112 years have passed . 
We will certainly not be here in 112 years to debate this act again . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney -- Alouette , Canadian Alliance ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to speak to Bill S-13 . 
This bill has been a long time coming . 
Members of the Canadian Alliance have answered hundreds of letters and have received many petitions concerning the release of census data over the last three years . 
My colleague , the member for Edmonton Southwest , is the official opposition critic for census records and his offices receive letters almost daily on this issue since it left the Senate . 
I would like to pay tribute to the hard work of my colleague from Edmonton Southwest on this issue , as well as my colleagues from Calgary Southeast and Peace River who have also had a great deal of input and hard work on this bill and on this issue as well . 
The Canadian Alliance voted unanimously in favour of the motion by the member for Calgary Southeast which stated : 
That , in the opinion of this House , the government should take all necessary steps to release the 1911 census records once they have been deposited in the National Archives in 2003 . 
The member for Peace River shepherded this issue through our caucus when it first came up in 2001 . 
As we all know , census records are an invaluable source of information for those conducting historical or genealogical research . 
In fact , the 1906 census , the document which gave rise to this bill , was a special census that was conducted only in the prairie provinces after the massive influx of immigrants at the turn of the century . 
The release of the 1906 census generated more than four million hits in the first 12 days it was online . 
The same story holds true for the 1901 census , which received more than 50 million hits for its first six months online . 
The problem , as I understand it , is the nature of the census data or one of the issues that we are bringing forward . 
Statistics Canada strives to protect the integrity of the information it gathers . 
In Canada we have kept census information secret for a long period of time after the data is initially collected .  We have kept census information secret for 92 years on average . 
That is 28 years longer than in the United States and eight years shorter than in the United Kingdom . 
In my opinion , 92 years is a reasonable period of time to keep information under wraps , so to speak . 
At the turn of the century some ambiguities were raised as to how long such information should be kept from public release . 
According to Statistics Canada , census takers were given conflicting instructions on how to collect census data . 
It may have led some Canadians to believe that their information would be kept secret forever . 
Obviously that is not the case . 
This situation was clarified when confidentiality and disclosure regulations that had existed for previous census operations were enforced by law for the 1911 census . 
The Canadian commissioner of privacy and a legal opinion received by Statistics Canada have led some groups to push that census records be kept secret for 20 years longer , a total of 112 years , due to the provision in Canadian law to keep personal records secret until 20 years after the death of an individual . 
Bill S-13 attempts to reach a compromise between concerns for privacy and the covenant agreed to by Statistics Canada and the Canadian public through the census . 
It was originally proposed that this bill be passed in a single sitting . 
The Canadian Alliance , the official opposition , could not agree to such a course of action for three reasons that I will now touch on . 
First , we are seeking clarity concerning the conditional release of information . 
Second , we would like to discuss the creation of a new bureaucracy and new regulations to police the conditional release of information . 
Third and finally , I want to debate the appropriate passage of time before census information should be released to the public . 
As I understand it , the only information that will be released after 92 years is what is often referred to as tombstone information , basic information : name , address , age , date of birth , marital status , sex and occupation . 
At the turn of the century this scope of information comprised the bulk of the census . 
However some interesting questions have been asked over the years , ranging from the mental state of members of one 's family to the type of private company one keeps , questions that understandably Statistics Canada would like to treat gently and that Canadians have concerns about in terms of the privacy issues . 
One has to wonder if the questions that need to be treated differently need to be asked at all . 
That is a point of debate as well . 
Nevertheless , the Alliance is hoping to clarify why there would only be a partial release of information , especially since researchers would be required to fill out an application in order to access this information . 
That brings me to my second point . 
The lion 's share of this bill deals with section 17 of the Statistics Act which governs secrecy . 
As I understand it , the information released after 92 years would be reviewed by those who fill out an application to view the records . 
There would be two separate sets of researchers allowed to access census records after 92 years , genealogists and historians . 
Genealogists would be required to fill out a very simple form and their qualifications , to the best of my knowledge , would not be reviewed . 
Historians , however , would have to be vouched for . 
According to the draft regulations proposed to cabinet , persons applying to conduct historical research would be required to submit an application on their own behalf accompanied by a form from a list of people who have `` assessed the public and scientific value of the research '' . 
The people who can approve historical research are presidents or faculty deans of universities , senior elected community officials such as a mayor or a reeve , president of an ethnic or cultural association , a member of Parliament , a senator , a member of the provincial legislature , senior clergy , a native chief , a chief librarian , provincial archivist , the national archivist of Canada and the chief statistician of Canada . 
Clearly , this list of people who can approve access to census information should be included in the bill . 
Taking a member of Parliament as an example , many people may ask about our qualifications in assessing the public and scientific value of proposed research . 
Members of Parliament are busy , as are their staff members . 
In addition to being seen as unqualified by some in this regard , it could take us a long time to respond to requests from historical researchers which may affect their research . 
Further to the release of information , there is a section of the bill which states that with the 2006 census , those people filling out the census would have to give their consent at the time they fill out the census forms for the information to be disclosed after 112 years . 
This section is a bit puzzling . 
It is the subject about which our critic 's office has received the most amount of mail , with concerns about this particular aspect of the bill . 
Will there be a campaign to educate people about this clause ? 
Is it a one time offer ? 
Can a person go back and change his or her decision ? 
Who is allowed to check the consent box for children ? 
How many people does the government expect may opt out of a public release ? 
If more than 50 % of Canadians choose to keep their census records secret until the end of the time period , how would that skew the other 49 % of records that are released ? 
How much would it cost Canadians to administer and keep these records secret ? 
These are all questions that need to be answered .  They are not clearly laid out in the bill in its current state . 
Finally , we wonder why we need to create a new bureaucracy to police this endeavour of trying to obtain access to census information . 
A form is being created for those who wish to conduct research on census information . 
As I have outlined , that could create a whole new level of bureaucracy . 
Reading the speech from Liberal Senator Lorna Milne , the champion of the bill , she states , `` The government does not want to make it difficult to conduct historical and genealogical research '' . 
If that were the case , the government would not be imposing new and complicated procedures in order to access census information . 
It is my experience that regulations and forms make things more difficult , not easier . 
As the opposition , we therefore must ask , has the government conducted a cost benefit analysis on these new regulations ? 
Does the government have any idea how many people would be applying to review these records ? 
How is the government going to police the use of these records ? 
Will there be fines or jail time for those who misuse their privileges ? 
The Canadian Alliance will be proposing amendments to this bill . 
Many of them will focus on the questions that have been raised in my speech today and which have been championed by my colleague from Edmonton . 
One of the most important questions facing the House is how much time is appropriate to respect the privacy rights of those who have completed census forms . 
Today the average life expectancy of Canadian males is 75 years and of females is 81 years . 
In all likelihood our personal information will not be made available until long after we are gone . 
The Canadian Alliance believes that 92 years of secrecy is sufficient to protect the integrity of census records . 
At the same time , we do not belittle the privacy concerns of Canadians and the Privacy Commissioner on the subject . 
In fact the Canadian Alliance is very concerned about the breadth and scope of the current census forms . 
Many of us know people who have heard from constituents who feel the long form of the census asks for too much personal information . 
Statistics Canada is the depository of highly sensitive and private information of private citizens and corporations . 
Many individuals and corporations believe that Statistics Canada collects too much information these days and then , because of the sheer volume of information , is delayed in releasing analysis in a timely manner , but that is a debate for another day . 
I want to close my comments by thanking members for the opportunity to discuss these issues . 
I realize it has taken a long time to create this bill . 
Many consultations have taken place . 
I cannot support this bill in its current form unless it is amended and many of the questions that I have addressed and the official opposition has addressed are answered in the process . 
Mr. Paul Crête ( Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the hon. member 's remarks . 
Yes , this question has come up in every riding office because we have historical and genealogy societies which , in the past , have lobbied repeatedly to get us to authorize the release of such data . 
With respect to the time periods used in other countries , one example is the United States , where participation is mandatory and release permitted after 72 years . 
That is the number of years the files remain confidential before being made public . 
In the United Kingdom , it is the same thing , but the period is 100 years . 
In Australia it is 99 years . 
In France they are talking about 100 years . 
In Canada the proposal is for 92 years for the censuses previous to those mentioned in the bill . 
Considering the whole concept of protection of confidential information , is it not true that the time periods established by this bill correspond to those found in many other places and would be sufficient protection for personal information ? 
I believe my hon. colleague said that he and his party could not support this bill . 
Is he aware that , with a decision like that , if the House were to reject the bill , we would be in a situation where , for many years yet , historical researchers and genealogists would be deprived of important sources of information ? 
And yet the bill before us today appears to meet the minimum conditions necessary for protection of confidential information in our society . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously my colleague has spent a great deal of time on this issue . 
He has had a number of constituents with concerns , as we all have . 
They have come to us wanting access to information for a number of different reasons . 
This bill lays out much of that information . 
My colleague 's question is mainly focused on the time aspect . 
We believe 92 years is an appropriate amount of time . 
I believe 112 years is being outlined in the current bill . 
There seems to be a balance between privacy and the release of information . 
At the same time , one of the bigger concerns is the two-pronged approach to access to the records for someone looking at census data for genealogical purposes versus someone looking at the information for historical research . 
There is a dual track system that is going to limit historians ' access to the information in that they will have to fill out more forms , which may include taking up more of our time as members of Parliament , as outlined in my speech . 
I do think that 92 years is an appropriate period of time that should be in place for the release of all the information . 
There should not be the 92 year and 112 year time periods in the bill . 
It should be 92 years for the release of that information . 
Mr. Brian Masse ( Windsor West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , one of the interesting aspects of the bill is that it is correcting a mistake . 
It corrects an oversight which did not quite align to what we have right now . 
That is why we have a number of different changes with Bill S-13 which will clarify what could have been done before . 
One of the comments of the member is a concern that I have heard from other people that too much information is being gathered in new census data . 
This goes back to an important issue which is the confidentiality and the reliability of the data . 
How does the member feel about Lockheed Martin winning the contract for future census gathering ? 
The bill does talk about that . 
There is enlightened consent for the new data . 
We could be setting ourselves up for another problem that the bill is correcting right now . 
My concern is that is what the contract is going to do and this bill crosses over into that . 
This is going to provide some good improvements . 
We have heard some great arguments that deal with the sensitivity about privacy and also what historians and genealogists need to do . 
At the same time , the government 's actions by not insourcing to Statistics Canada and putting it out to private tender to Lockheed Martin is going to potentially repeat a problem and cause us some great concern . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , my colleague raises a grave issue , one which he has raised in the House before . 
It is one that has been asked during question period a number of times and one that has not been answered by the government . 
We do not know why that is , or we do know why and part of the reason is that it is called question period , not answer period . 
It is a rare day when we actually get an answer to that kind of question . 
It would be a good question to further probe the government on that contract . 
The first point my colleague mentioned was the information that is gathered and the sensitivity of that information . 
Canadians do have concerns about the sensitivity of information that is gathered through the census by Statistics Canada . 
One of the questions that comes up is should one give consent now for information to be released , how does that impact changes in questions that are asked at a later date ? 
As I mentioned in my speech , is that a one time thing ? 
What if the forms change and people are not comfortable with releasing the information gathered later on down the road ? 
These are questions that have been left floating out there that we cannot quite put our finger on because they have not been outlined or answered by the government at this point . 
Hopefully we will get to those issues during this debate and also in further examination of the bill . 
We will be putting forward some amendments to address those questions . 
My colleague asked a good question . 
I would like to hear what the government has to say . 
I wish it would actually answer that rather than skate around it . 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened very carefully to what my colleague had to say . 
I also listened carefully to his second last answer . 
This debate is the culmination of a very remarkable campaign across the country for change in the way census information is released . 
People who were involved professionally , people in the public service , professional historians and others , came to us and explained this complicated matter that there had been a rule that information was not being released and that it should be . 
That was followed by this remarkable grassroots campaign from genealogists . 
Genealogists is a fancy term but it includes most of us some of the time , people who have a great interest in their own family 's history or their region 's history . 
I presented petitions . 
I met with people in my riding . 
To give some idea , at the farmer 's market people would stop me and ask what progress was being made with the release of these census facts . 
I listened very carefully to my colleague opposite but I still do not understand what he and his party propose to do . 
If they could change this , what would they do for the genealogists and professional historians who play such an important role in nurturing the culture of our nation ? 
Would he care to comment on that ? 
What is he going to do for these genealogists ? 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , my colleague brings up some good questions . 
He has been involved in this issue and has some expertise in this area . 
One of the questions that we have on this side of the House is , why is there a two-prong approach to access the information ? 
Genealogists are filling out a simple form and historians must go through a more rigorous process to have access to that very same information . 
That is one of the concerns that we have . 
One of the other main concerns is the time limit on the release of the information . 
My understanding is that there are two time periods : 92 years and 112 years , both within the same bill . 
Why is there that particular discrepancy ? 
The Alliance believes that 92 years would safeguard information for people and be appropriate . 
That would be my response to my colleague . 
Mr. Paul Crête ( Kamouraska -- Rivière-du-Loup -- Témiscouata -- Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak on this bill entitled an act to amend the Statistics Act . 
For many years , historical societies , genealogists and students , conducting various types of research , have been saying that they are facing a huge obstacle , because previous legislation failed to limit how long census information would be kept confidential . 
Much time has been needed to analyze and study this issue . 
Now a bill is before the House . 
Our society is greatly concerned with the protection of privacy . 
This reaction is quite understandable . 
On one hand , archivists , historians , genealogists and others are interested in historical research and data collected by Statistics Canada . 
The National Statistics Council and the Privacy Commissioner are among those who initially opposed the release of such information . 
As legislators , we need to balance both sides to ensure that this bill does indeed provide sufficient protection of personal information and also allow historians and archivists to do their jobs adequately . 
In Canada , there is a long established practice which states that : 
All individual census records , up to and including those from the 1901 Census , have been transferred from Statistics Canada to the National Archives and made available for public use . 
The data for the 1891 and the 1901 Censuses were transferred and released 92 years after their collection . 
Hence the minimum waiting period established for the use of information . 
However , as I mentioned earlier , those using this type of information disagree . 
The minister appointed a committee of experts to consider such issues . 
I want to mention , for example , this committee on which Mr. Justice La Forest , former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada , sat . 
He carefully considered the various opinions expressed . 
He concluded that this guarantee of confidentially was not intended to last indefinitely . 
He stated : 
Our view is that the passage of 92 years is sufficient time to allay concerns regarding individual privacy . 
Consequently , the committee addressed this issue and had to assess how to strike a balance between protecting personal information and disclosing information for the purposes of studying history and the past , in order to ensure that our culture in Quebec and Canada would be known in the future under acceptable conditions . 
I remember representations , in particular by Jeannine Ouellette , who was very active in the Société d'histoire et de généalogie de Rivière-du-Loup and by people from the Société d'histoire de la Côte-sud . 
Ms. Ouellette was also heavily involved in a Quebec-wide coalition of genealogical and historical societies . 
These representations were made on many occasions to show us that it is not a question of allowing the wholesale use of personal information or of creating a precedent for the future , which would be dangerous , but of having proper guidelines . 
We believe that is what Bill S-13 provides . 
The committee that studied this issue said it was convinced that legislators had probably not wished or intended to provide an indefinite guarantee of confidentiality . 
Nonetheless , conservation and release dates had been omitted , not because there was opposition to them , but because with the scientific knowledge at the time , the need for such a measure had not been anticipated . 
In any event , no law is forever . 
There is always room to reconsider legislation in the light of reality as it evolves . 
That is what we are doing today with Bill S-13 . 
The committee reported , and I quote : 
We have reviewed legal opinions provided to Statistics Canada and to the National Archives by the Department of Justice and we recognize that legal minds can differ regarding the legal standing of various assurances given respondents versus the indication that records were to be transferred to the Archives . 
However , while we find the legal situation ambiguous , we find no convincing evidence that Parliament intended to create perpetual confidentiality . 
We have come to the view that the release of pre-1906 census records constitutes a particularly important precedent particularly when combined with the fact that release of the 1891 and 1901 census records occurred in concert with the 1983 Privacy Act . 
We further believe that the passage of time -- 92 years in this case -- is an important legal and moral consideration and that the release of census records after 92 years in no way violates the original intent of those who developed the census in Canada . 
We do recognize that the passage of the Statistics Act in 1918 , with its encoded guarantees of confidentiality , adds an element of uncertainty as does the disappearance , after 1946 , of the requirement that census records be transferred to the National Archives but this does not change our view of the spirit and intent . 
On the basis of this analysis and the information provided in it , the 92-year period referred to is the timeframe applicable , when consent has been provided to use the information , to some of the information that can be used for research purposes . 
For any information concerning a person , it is 112 years . 
If consent is refused -- one may not want the information to be used -- the information is then protected forever . 
No problem there . 
Let us come back to the 92-year period . 
I think that , in this kind of situation , it is important to see how other countries are doing . 
In most countries where historical census records are released , personal and confidential information is protected for a period of 70 to 100 years , after which the records enter into the public domain . 
In Canada , this period of confidentiality varied before enactment of the Privacy Act . 
Now , however , it sets the period at 92 years . 
In other countries , such as the U.S. , participation in the census is mandatory . 
There is provision for release after 72 years . 
The period in the U.K. is 100 years , Australia 99 years , and France 100 years , but a partial release for only a few cantons . 
This is a peculiarity of the French census . 
In Canada , as I said , the period is 92 years . 
It is a bit hard to explain how they came up with that figure , but it seems to have been the time lapse that would have allowed immediate release of the 1891 census data when the legislation was passed in 1983 . 
This strikes us as a worthwhile timeframe . 
For all these reasons , the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of the principle behind Bill S-13 , because we feel it respects the right to privacy . 
It demonstrates great respect for those concerned . 
There is no question of allowing the release of information . 
The timeframes are set . 
Given people 's life spans and the protection afforded , we feel that this strikes the necessary balance between protecting people 's privacy and research requirements . 
In concrete terms , Bill S-13 amends the Statistics Act . 
It was initiated in the Senate , then referred to a Senate committee , and now this is its first time to be debated in the House . 
We have now reached second reading . 
It has , however , likely been discussed in all MPs ' offices already . 
Historical and genealogical societies have come to us on numerous occasions to set out what they wanted for the genealogists , who often do research on a volunteer basis . 
All they need , therefore , is information with which to put together a history of a family or a village . 
This is the kind of data they need . 
For these reasons , we believe that this bill offers a satisfactory way of proceeding . 
It amends the Statistics Act and attempts to dissipate the legal ambiguity surrounding viewing of census returns from 1910 to 2003 . 
Because of the existing legislation , it was not very clear that such data really could be a released . 
There have been court cases ; but as legislators , we now have an opportunity to settle the issue . 
The bill would enable genealogists and historical researchers to consult census returns under certain conditions , for a period of 20 years beginning 92 years after the census . 
Thus , 92 years after the census , research can begin , under certain specific conditions for a period of 20 years . 
All restrictions regarding examination of the returns will be lifted 112 years after the date of the census . 
This period is long enough . 
Considering the life expectancy of the people covered by a census , it is quite certain that all those individuals will have died by that time . 
Thus , we will avoid situations where releasing information could create complications . 
If we look at the bill in more detail , we see that the new section 17(4) permits a person wishing to conduct genealogical or historical research , who has obtained written approval -- it is good that this is specified -- to examine census data . 
The bill states that section 17 is amended by adding the following : 
(5) In deciding whether to approve a historical research project , a person must assess the public and scientific value of the research . 
Thus , it cannot be just anyone doing anything at all . 
There are approvals to obtain ; requests must be serious . 
There is no question of authorizing frivolous proposals . 
Conditions governing the use and disclosure of census data apply if a person wishes to obtain authorization for genealogical or historical research . 
Persons wishing such to examine such records must sign and comply with an undertaking in prescribed form . 
Anyone who might behave in such as way as to not be in compliance with the law would have to face the consequences , having made a commitment to respect the conditions set out . 
In fact , anyone not respecting his or her undertaking is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $ 1,000 .
