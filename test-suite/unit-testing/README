                          PORTAGEshared unit-testing

This directory contains a collection of ad hoc unit test suites.  These suites
typically take too long or are too complex to integrate them into the unit
testing framework we use in the src/ subdirectory.  Some of these test suites
are self verifying and automated via a run-test.sh script.  These get exercised
if you run ./run-all-tests.sh.  Others are only partially automated and require
manual analysis.

After installing PORTAGEshared, you can run the automated test suites by
invoking ./run-all-tests.sh.  If all tests pass, great.  If not, differences in
floating point rounding between your architecture and ours is a likely cause,
and might not indicate an real problem.

Contents of this directory:

 - run-all-tests.sh     Master script running all fully automated suites.
 - hmm-classes/         Test suite for the class-conditioned variant of the HMM
                        word alignment module.
 - hmm-lex/             Test suite for the lexically conditioned variant of the
                        HMM word alignment module.
 - hmm-sym/             Test suite for symmetrized training of HMM word
                        alignment models.
 - lm/                  Test suite for using our various LM file formats and
                        filtering options.
 - rescoring.metric/    Test suite for using PER or WER in cow.sh.
 - script.ff/           Test suite for the SCRIPT: rescoring feature.
 - tokenize.pl/         Test suite for recent enhancements to our tokenizer.
 - toy/                 Complete use of the PORTAGEshared software suite on a
                        tiny corpus, with parameters chosen to run very fast
                        (*not* recommended as an experimental starting point).
 - framework-toy/       Data for a toy experiment using our experimental
                        framework (recommended as your starting point).
