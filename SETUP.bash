# =======================================================================
# USER CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES

# The PORTAGE environment variable points the the root of the PortageII
# package.
# Change this variable to indicate where this package is actually located.
PORTAGE=$HOME/PortageII-cur

# Where the generic model is installed. Update this variable if you install the
# generic model in a non-standard location.
PORTAGE_GENERIC_MODEL=$PORTAGE/generic-model

# Software overrides
# Uncomment and change the following if you installed these packages in
# a different location:
#CHINESE_SEGMENTATION_HOME_OVERRIDE=$PORTAGE/third-party/chinese-segmentation
#PYTHON_HOME_OVERRIDE=$PORTAGE/third-party/miniconda2
#PYTHON_HOME_OVERRIDE=$PORTAGE/third-party/python-2.7
#ICU_HOME_OVERRIDE=$PORTAGE/third-party/icu
#PERL_HOME_OVERRIDE=$PORTAGE/third-party/perl-5.14
#JAVA_HOME_OVERRIDE=$PORTAGE/third-party/jdk-1.7
#MITLM_HOME_OVERRIDE=$PORTAGE/third-party/mitlm
#PHPUNIT_HOME_OVERRIDE=$PORTAGE/third-party/phpunit

# Extra software configuration
# Add scripts called <prog-name>.bash in third-party/conf.d/, following the
# examples there, to configure additional third-party dependencies.

# Binary distributions only: we used to include 32 and 64 bits pre-compiled
# executable, with and without ICU.  We no longer support 32 bits since tuning
# requires more than 4GB of RAM.  We no longer provide non-ICU binaries since
# we distribute ICU libraries with PortageII.
# Nonetheless, PRECOMP_PORTAGE_ARCH continues to be required for binary
# distributions, in case we distribute new pre-compiles variants in the future.
# Uncomment the following line if your distribution is binary:
#PRECOMP_PORTAGE_ARCH=x86_64-el5-icu
