This directory contains a third-party Chinese segmenter, mansegment.perl, as
well as an improved version modified at NRC.  In compliance with the terms of
the mansegment.perl licence, this code is "free" (see the Copyright notice in
ldc-cn-seg/mansegment.perl for a precise definition of what we mean here), but
included with the Portage distribution for convenience.  It is not covered by
the terms of the PortageII licence.

The script chinese_segmenter.pl is a complete rewrite of mansegment.perl.
The accompanying database, manseg.fre, is simply ldc-cn-seg/Mandarin.fre
converted from the GB2312 encoding to UTF-8.

To install NRC's modified Chinese segmenter, copy the script itself to a bin/
directory on your PATH, and manseg.fre into the corresponding lib/ directory.
For example, this will work:
   cp bin/chinese_segmenter.pl $PORTAGE/bin
   cp lib/manseg.fre $PORTAGE/lib
