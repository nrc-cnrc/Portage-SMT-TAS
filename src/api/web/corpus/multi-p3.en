Nets and Pistons Advanced to Second Round of NBA Eastern Conference
(AFP, Washington)  On Thursday, the New Jersey Nets again survived the desperate outbursts of the Indiana Pacers' clutch player Miller to beat the Pacers 120-109 after the second overtime, winning the critical Game 5 in the first round of the NBA playoffs and advancing to the second round.
The Detroit Pistons were also advanced after edging out the Toronto Raptors in Game 5.
The Pistons did not perform well in this game.  It was not until Stackhouse made a sideline jumper, 1 minute 43 seconds before time expired, that the team gained an 85-82 lead, claiming its first victory in a playoff series in 11 years.
In the game in New Jersey, Nets shooter Kidd scored a new career playoff high with 31 points.  In addition, he had 8 rebounds and 7 assists, creating numerous scoring opportunities for the Nets, which is the top-seeded team in the Eastern Division.
This is only the second time that the Nets have entered the second round since the team was founded.  They will take on the Charlotte Hornets, the fifth-seeded team, in the best-of-seven semi-final that starts on Sunday.
However, it was Miller who received the biggest spotlight in the game.  After his excellent performance in the playoffs, he was again spectacular, nearly making the eighth-seeded Pacers a breakout team.
He scored a shot right before the buzzer in regulation to tie the score. His basket was one of the most spectacular final critical baskets in the history of the playoffs, forcing the game into overtime.  A moment later, he caught the Nets off guard and dribbled to the basket for a dunk, bringing the score to a tie again and sending the game into the second overtime.
The Nets, led by Kidd, displayed great resilience and won in the end by 11 points.
Miller scored a total of 31 points during the game, yet he was tightly guarded and held scoreless in the second overtime.
Church Pulled out Settlement with Victims over Boston Priest's Sexual Abuse Scandal
(AFP, Boston, Massachusetts)  After the case of the pedophile Boston Catholic priest Geoghan was brought to light, a multimillion-dollar settlement was originally reached between the Archdiocese of Boston and the victims in the hope that the pending litigation might be resolved out of court.  However, the Church suddenly pulled out of the settlement.  Dozens of alleged Geoghan victims are now considering legal countermoves.
The position of the Archdiocese of Boston yesterday came as an unexpected dramatic reversal.  They claimed their financial advisors found that the Church, already in financial straits, is unable to bear the burden.  Therefore, they will cancel the March settlement ranging from 20 million US dollars to 30 million US dollars reached with 86 alleged victims of pedophilia.
The archdiocese's finance council issued a statement saying: "The proposed settlement would consume substantially all the resources the archdiocese can reasonably have access to.  Therefore, such an action would leave the archdiocese unable to provide a fair and proportional response to other victims."
Under the cancelled settlement agreement, victims' damages will be assessed by a disinterested mediator based on individual cases.  Payments may reach as much as a million US dollars for the most severely abused victims to 25,000 US dollars for the less severely abused victims.
The archdiocese's finance council thinks that this agreement may force the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston into bankruptcy as the cases of the alleged sexual abuse keep surfacing, and on the other hand, "the situation has changed dramatically since the process leading to the agreement started."
The 66-year-old Geoghan was recently sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for his sexual molestation of a 10-year-old boy in 1991.
The defrocked priest also faces other criminal trials and scores of civil lawsuits.
US and India to Conduct First Joint Military Exercise in Mid-May in 4 Decades
(AFP, New Delhi)  The United States and India will conduct their first joint military exercise in 39 years to mark a milestone in the cooperation between the two largest democracies in the world.
The Ministry of National Defense said that in mid-May, an elite brigade of Indian paratroopers will conduct a joint military exercise with the special forces of the US Pacific Command near the renowned Taj Mahal.
The air forces from the two nations will provide support.
The Ministry of National Defense said it will be the first of the many military exercises to be conducted by the two nations.
The relations between the United States and India were strained during the Cold War era.  However, the situation has been dramatically improved since the Sept.11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington D.C.
Apart from patrolling the sea with the US navy in the Strait of Malacca between Indonesia and Malaysia so as to prevent any acts of piracy, India in recent years has also conducted joint military exercises with Britain, France and Japan.
A spokesman from the Ministry of National Defense of India said: "The upcoming exercise aims at further enhancing the military cooperation between India and the United States."
The last time India conducted a joint military exercise with the United States was a year after a brief border war between India and China in 1962.
Since last July, about 50 US policy makers have visited India while about an equal number of people from India, including Prime Minister Vajpayee and his national security team, paid visits to Washington D.C.
After the Sept.11 terrorist attacks, and the attack on the national parliament in New Delhi last December that led to military tensions between India and Pakistan, there have been increased contacts between the United States and India.
The diplomat said that the national defense policy makers in the United States and India decided on the mid-May military exercise in February partly because they also wanted to ease New Delhi's discomfort over the strengthening relationship between the United States and Pakistan.
South African Space Tourist Back to Earth after his Space Travel
(AFP, Moscow)  South African space tourist Shuttleworth was back to Earth on the 5th.  The Russian spacecraft he had boarded undocked smoothly from the International Space Station at 7:31 a.m. Taipei time and successfully landed on the steppe in northwestern Kazakhstan in Central Asia at 11:51.
Shuttleworth is the second paying space tourist in history after the American citizen Tito.
Both he and Tito paid 20 million US dollars for their chance of space travel.
Shuttleworth boarded a Russian spacecraft on April 25 to enter space where he stayed for 10 days to conduct a series of medical and biological science experiments.
Returning together with Shuttleworth to Earth are the Russian spacecraft commander Gidzenko and the Italian engineer Vittori who entered space with him.
After the spacecraft landed on terra firma, Shuttleworth and his two partners will be first given a physical exam before boarding a helicopter to fly to Astana in Kazakhstan where they will be transferred to the Russian capital Moscow on the same day.
Shuttleworth, who just turned 28 this year, is a very wealthy computer information businessman.  He paid 20 million US dollars for this space trip, fulfilling his dream of a 10-day space travel.
The first space tourist in human history is Tito, a businessman who turned 60 this year.  He went on his space travel as a paying tourist in April last year.
The Russian medical specialists pointed out earlier that Shuttleworth is more suitable for space travel than Tito.
During this space travel, he conducted a number of scientific experiments at the International Space Station, including a study on AIDS pathogens.
Shuttleworth's space travel has drawn great publicity in South Africa and won the honor of being the most important news event since Mandela's release from prison.
US Government Not Impressed by Castro's Goodwill Stance to Carter
(AFP, Washington)  The US President Bush's administration is not impressed by the goodwill stance the Cuban President Castro has extended to former US President Carter who is making a landmark visit to the communist island nation Cuba.
Castro expressed his willingness to allow Carter to meet freely with dissidents and visit all areas, including those labs that Washington has alleged are manufacturing key biological weapon components.
The White House and the State Department said these proposals are meaningless.
The US State Department spokeswoman Cassel said: "President Carter is visiting Cuba as a private citizen.  He has not been sent there to inspect possible facilities of chemical or biological weapons."
Her brief remark seems to echo the response of other commentators who pointed out that neither Carter nor the other members of his delegation have any science background necessary for a proper inspection of the labs.
Carter insisted that there was no mention of the US concern over Cuba's plan for biological weapons while he was briefed by the government officials, but the US Secretary of State Powell indicated he did not believe this.
Powell told ABC Network: "I don't know what briefing President Carter was given.  I am certain that we have no reservation
about our belief that Cuba possesses the research capabilities for biological warfare."
Napster CEO Hilbers Resigns
(AFP, San Francisco)  Napster, the once all-popular company for free music downloading, said that its chief executive Hilbers has resigned, effective immediately.
It is still unknown at present who will be Hilbers' replacement.
Napster's music website has remained closed as of today ever since the court ruled last year that its service had given rise to wide-spread copying.
After Napster's music website was shut down, many other websites have taken its place.
The Redwood City, California-based Napster stated: "We deeply regret that we haven't got a solution to funding yet that would enable Napster to launch a service to benefit artists and website users."
It went on to say: "We will take measures in the coming week to further cut expenses."
Hilbers, once an executive officer of the German media giant Bertelsmann, took the position of Napster CEO at a time when Bertelsmann started to help the struggling Napster to continue its operation within the framework of the court ruling.
OECD Ministers Examine Outlook of World Economy in Paris
(AFP, Paris)  Senior ministers from the major industrial nations in the world met in Paris on the 15th for a 2-day meeting.  They will examine the future of a promising economy as well as confront the looming division caused by the trade dispute between the United States and Europe.
Representatives from the 30 member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will also concern themselves with the conflict arising from the efforts of rich and poor nations as they abridge the gap between them.
However, the discussion on macroeconomics may be eclipsed by the escalating trade friction between the United States and the European Union.
Leaders from the European nations expressed their indignation on a bill signed by President Bush on the 13th that will allow the government to increase its subsidies to the US farmers by 70% over the next decade.
The EU officials think the bill violates the promise the United States made at the WTO ministerial conference held in Doha, capital of Qatar, last November on terminating its farm export subsidies.
At the forum prior to the opening ceremony of the ministerial meeting, Belgian Prime Minister Verhofstadt said: "It is hypocritical to talk with eloquence about the market liberalization yet fail to implement it."
Mid-term Election May Slow Down US Efforts to Promote Free Trade
(AFP, Washington)  Economists and analysts say that many of the additional trade barriers imposed to woo voters in all constituencies in the mid-term election may slow down the ever ongoing US efforts to promote global free trade.
Economist Schott from the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank, said: "US President Bush is determined to put the political goal above that of promoting a sound US economy."
The Bush administration, said he, succumbing to pressures from the steel industry and its labor union, levies a tariff of as high as 30% on certain steel products from a number of major suppliers, including the EU, Russia, Japan and Brazil.
In addition, Bush also imposes an anti-dumping tariff of 27% on a certain kind of lumber from Canada to be used as building material on the ground that the Canadian government's export subsidies on the lumber have constituted dumping.
Schott said, what is more aggravating is that in the recently promulgated "Farm Bill," the US federal government has increased subsidies on certain farm products by nearly 80%, grossly violating the promise the United States made in the trade negotiations held last November in Doha, capital of Qatar.
At Doha conference, the United States insisted on the liberalization of farm trade so as to help facilitate the access of farm products of poor nations into the markets of rich nations.
Correspondingly, under the free trade, developed nations will also find it easier to provide poor nations with their products and services.
The damage of this US farm bill to the free trade, said Schott, has far surpassed the damage brought about by the measure of imposing tariffs on steel imports.
US Government Officials Defend Government's Handling of Warnings of Terrorist Attacks
(AFP, Washington)  Senior US officials scrambled to defend the government's handling of the warnings prior to the Sept.11 terrorist attacks, the reports alleged, that included the warning that terrorists under Osama bin Laden might hijack US commercial airlines.
Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted in NBC's Today show that President Bush "did what he should, namely, to go all out to pursue the global terrorist organizations and do everything in his power to deal with the nations that harbor these terrorists."
He said that terrorists "may attack at any time and by any means available.  It would be practically impossible to protect all locations at all times."
US Vice President Cheney, on the other hand, warned the Democrats last night "to be extra cautious and not to seek political interests by making incendiary remarks such as saying the White House had received advance information and could have prevented the bloody Sept. 11 attacks."
After the White House admitted on the night of the 15th that Bush had received the warning prior to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that terrorists might hijack US commercial airplanes, the government came under fire.
British Airways Posts First Annual Loss in 15 Years
(AFP, London)  As reported by British Airways, although the amount of loss is smaller than expected, British Airways has posted its first annual loss since its privatization 15 years ago.
In the previous fiscal year that ended at the end of March, British Airways' pre-tax loss is £200 million (320 million euros or 290 million US dollars) against a restated profit of £150 million the preceding year.
In the fourth quarter alone, British Airways lost £85 million, compared with a loss of £65 million a year ago.
The former state-owned British Airways blamed the poor performance on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks of last year, a global economic slowdown, and the foot-and-mouth disease which kept foreign tourists away from Britain.
The annual dividend, said British Airways, was thus scrapped.
Eddington, the airline's chief executive, said: "The airline market is expected to remain weak but the quick and decisive actions we have taken have shown we are determined to return the business to acceptable levels of profitability."
However, the result still beat the market expectation that British Airways would lose even more.
In the early trading session at the stock market, the BA shares rose 2.6% to 241.75 pence.
This price was 8% down from the price shortly before the September 11 attacks; yet compared with the highest price of 760 pence in May 1997, it was down by almost 70%.
Bush: US not to Lift Embargo until Cuba Holds Free Elections
(AFP, Washington)  US President Bush said that only if Cuba holds elections "that can be proved to be free and fair" and promotes the reform in the economic system will the United States lift the 41-year-old embargo against Cuba.
Bush said in a speech at the White House: "Only till then will I work with the US Congress to remove the embargo on the trade and travel between the United States and Cuba."
He said: "Trade with Cuba will only help Castro."
Former US President Jimmy Carter went to Cuba for a week's visit and called for the United States to lift the embargo in this only communist country in the Americas.
Merely 48 hours after he returned to the United States, Bush made this most recent speech of his on Cuba.
Bush proposed in his speech to step up the humanitarian assistance to Cuba and reach agreements directly with the Cuban people through non-governmental agencies.
He also indicated that the United States will hold negotiations with Cuba on resuming direct mail service between the two countries.
The issue has so far been consistently rejected by the Cuban government.
Death Toll Rose as Overnight Shelling Went on at India-Pakistan Border
(AFP, Jammu, India)  The Indian police said that Pakistan's shelling last night at the disputed Kashmir border area left one Indian soldier and three civilians dead, including two children.
The shelling took place in Baramulla area 75 km west of Jammu, the winter capital in southern India.
Police sources said that the Pakistani military bombarded this area throughout the night with heavy mortar fire and rocket-propelled grenades.  One mortar hit a residential structure, killing two children and one adult.
One soldier died in the cross-border shelling in the same area.
In addition, it is reported that Poonch area near Jammu, along the Kashmir demarcation of control separating India from Pakistani territories, also came under heavy artillery fires throughout last night.
In the meantime, an official said that in the shelling that was resumed this morning, India's shelling on the Pakistan-controlled Kashmir has caused the death toll of Pakistanis to rise to 12.
Irish Soccer Team Captain Keane Announces He will Retire after World Cup
(AFP, Dublin)  Captain Roy Keane, the heart and soul of the Irish soccer team, announced that he will retire after the World Cup, whereas even yesterday he still threatened to quit the representative team .
The British Manchester United midfielder made the above announcement in an emotional interview with Irish TV Station.
During the interview, he lashed out at Ireland for not making adequate preparation for this World Cup.
The Irish representative team is currently training on Saipan in the Pacific Ocean.
Keane once threatened to quit the representative team this week, but offered again to stay just a few hours later, throwing the Irish team into confusion.
The real reason why Keane threatened to quit and again offered to stay remains a mystery.  Yet he said today that the Irish team deserves the blame for failing to make appropriate preparation for the training prior to the World Cup.
He said: "I've come over here to play the soccer well, and I hope people around me want to play the soccer well too."
He said: "There would be no point if I didn't think we have a common goal; furthermore, it's been going on like this for quite a while."
He said: "Regarding some issues about the trip, I'd like to bang my head against a wall.
From training facilities to all kinds of problems, this trip is just a tip of iceberg."
He said: "You've seen the training pitch and I'm not being self-conceited.
The training pitch, travel arrangements, getting through the Customs when we're leaving the airport, there are tons of problems."
Bush Arrives in Russia for Historic Summit
(AFP, Moscow)  US President Bush arrived in Moscow today to hold a historic summit on new arms reduction measures and on shaping a 21st-century partnership between the two nations who were once bitter foes.
While Moscow is preparing in a grand style for the first visit from President Bush, the entire Russian capital has stepped up security.  One newspaper even cautions the Muscovites to watch for the US secret service snipers.
Ms. Khakamada, a liberal member of the State Duma, said: "I am very optimistic, not only because of the documents that we expect to sign, but also because of the real, mutual economic interests finally unfolding."
She said: "For the first time, the Kremlin is leading the foreign policy instead of following the public opinion polls that still do not trust the United States."
Bush and Putin will hold their first meeting on the 24th and will sign at the Kremlin the first nuclear arms reduction treaty in a decade, along with a border strategic partnership agreement before the meeting concludes.
The arms reduction treaty is the result of painstaking mutual efforts that once threatened to fail yet succeeded just now.
It stipulates that both sides reduce nuclear arms by two-thirds over the next decade, maintaining their nuclear warheads between 1,700 and 2,200 respectively.
The leaders of the two countries will also sign documents to reinforce their unexpectedly strong cooperation in a war against terrorism and a key policy paper aimed at coordinating their energy policies.
Rogozin, chairman of State Duma's Foreign Affairs Committee, said: "For the first time, we are moving from relations based on deterrence to a real partnership based on equality."
Pakistan Succeeds in Test-firing Second Missile
(AFP, Islamabad)  In the wake of the first missile test yesterday that has drawn international condemnation that the test would intensify the tensions with the neighboring India, Pakistan again succeeded in test-firing its second anti-ballistic missile today.
The announcement said that what was tested today is the newly-developed short-range surface-to-surface Hatf-III (Ghaznavi) missile.
This is the first time that this type of missile has been test-fired that has a range of 290 km.
Yesterday, Pakistan test-fired a nuclear-capable Hatf-v (Ghauri) missile that can penetrate deep into Indian territory.
In the meantime, Pakistani President Musharraf indicated that although Pakistan doesn't want any conflict with India, it is preparing for war.
Musharraf said at the Muslim conference being held here: "We don't want wars, but we are not afraid of wars.
We are preparing for war.
Nobody should have any misunderstanding about this."
Pakistan and India have massed about 1 million troops along their common border and have been exchanging bellicose statements.  They have also been exchanging fires in the endlessly disputed Kashmir in the past week.
Japanese Sporting Goods Firm Bankrupt due to Poor Sales of World Cup Merchandise
(AFP, Tokyo)  A former employee said while the World Cup fever continues to rage through Japan, a small Japanese sporting goods firm has been forced onto the path to bankruptcy for owing the huge license fee for manufacturing the World Cup goods.
Crix Yasuda, a firm located in Tokyo, applied to the court for bankruptcy protection on May 8 due to poor sales of the 20 items of its promoted merchandise featuring a World Cup mascot logo, including bags and whistles.
The former company employee, who declined to be named, said: "Our company has gone bankrupt as piles of the World Cup mascot goods sit in our warehouse.  We could not pay the license fee of 50 million yen (400,000 US dollars) to FIFA."
The employee said: "We entrusted a Chinese company to manufacture the goods in China and started to sell the merchandise in Japan in May last year.
Now the World Cup fever is raging, but our company went bankrupt even before the fever arrived."
Established in 1932, Crix Yasuda marketed soccer gear, including boots and kit.  It employed a total of 12 employees.
A figure for the company's liabilities was not immediately available.
FIFA's 2002 World Cup mascots are the blue, purple and yellow Spheriks respectively named Nik, Kaz and Ato, but the mascots have failed to win the favor of the public in Japan.
The World Cup soccer tournament jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea will start on May 31.
According to the official FIFA website, the names of the players Nik and Kaz, and the coach Ato were chosen in a vote by soccer fans from all over the world, but the association between the names above and the soccer is obscure.
FIFA and South Korea's and Japan's organizing committees for the World Cup started a full-scale campaign with much fanfare to promote the above mascots generated by computer 3D animation technology in December 1999.
Pakistan's President to Make a Speech on Imminent Threat of War
(AFP, Islamabad)  Since Pakistan's missile tests on the weekend have escalated the tensions between Pakistan and India, Pakistan's President Musharraf is scheduled to make a national televised speech tonight on the imminent threat of war between the two nations and explain the actions his government will take in response to this situation.
Pakistan, having indicated it would conduct a series of missile tests from the 25th to the 28th, has ignored the international appeal for restraints and test-fired two types of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads--a "Ghauri" medium-range missile capable of penetrating India and a newly-developed "Ghaznavi" short-range missile.
International leaders led by US President Bush have shown concerns over the missile tests.  Bush, however, indicated he is more concerned that "Musharraf demonstrates some results (in the global war on terrorism)."
Speaking about Musharraf's prevention of the cross-border incursion into India-controlled Kashmir, Bush said: "He must show his efforts."
The cross-border incursion into Indian-administered Kashmir by Pakistani radicals has already intensified the dispute between these two nuclear powers, resulting in a dangerous border stand-off.
In order to prevent the conflict from breaking out between these two hostile South Asian nations, the international community is intensifying its diplomatic moves.  Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Saltanov is scheduled to arrive on a peace mission here today.
Saltanov will discuss Russian President Putin's proposal.
Besides the meeting to be held at Alma Ata, capital of Kazakhstan, from June 3 through June 5, Putin indicated he is willing to arrange a face-to-face meeting between Pakistani and Indian leaders.
Pakistan already indicated that it will "make a positive response" to this proposal aimed at cooling down India-Pakistan dispute.
India, however, responded more cautiously, only indicating that Prime Minister Vajpayee will pay a visit to  Alma Ata, yet with no clarification whether the Indian and Pakistani leaders will meet.
UN Declares 10 Million in Southern Africa on Brink of Starvation
(AFP, Rome)  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the UN World Food Program (WFP) warned that in the four southern African countries, at least 10 million people are "on the brink of starvation."
The two agencies pointed out that millions of people in Malawi, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Swaziland are threatened with potential famine.
They also warned that the above figures are expected to rise once the reports on Zimbabwe and Mozambique are completed.
They noted: "Two successive years of poor harvests brought about by natural calamities, coupled with economic crises and the disrupted farming in some areas, have reduced the food production and supply in this region, resulting in one of the gravest agricultural disasters in a decade in southern Africa."
The two agencies appealed to the governments of all nations in the world to promptly take emergency measures "so as to prevent the wide-spread famine from turning into a huge humanitarian catastrophe."
They pointed out that at present, nearly 4 million tons of food must be imported to meet the minimum needs of food while 1.2 million tons of food must be made immediately available for emergencies.
Argentina's President Duhalde Suffers Public Protests for Inappropriate Economic Policies
(AFP, Buenos Aires)  Argentina's President Duhalde and his government's economic policies have been vehemently bombarded.  The general public and schools staged a one-day strike.  Crowds of people in protest blocked thousands of roads, bringing traffic to a complete standstill.
The Confederation of Argentine Workers (CTA), the largest labor union in the country, initiated the strike.
Unemployed workers as well as protesting workers occupied several main roads leading to the capital city of Buenos Aires and blocked the bridges and major thoroughfares, causing tremendous traffic commotion.
CTA leader Zamora told reporters that the protest is intended to arouse a real national protest movement to protest the hunger, despair and unemployment the Argentine people are currently experiencing.
In addition to monitoring closely the development of the situation, the senior Argentine officials were also gathered today for an intensive consultation, urging senators to take actions as soon as possible to repeal "the Economic Subversion Law" that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) promulgated as a condition for providing new loans to Argentina.
This law criminalizes both wrong business decisions and capital flight.
Multitudes of people both in the capital and the suburbs supported this protest, congregating finally in front of the Congress Building.  Many educational institutions as well as some airports also joined the general strike in protest.
Interior Ministers of European Nations Met for Discussion on Establishment of EU Border Police Force
(AFP, Rome)  Interior ministers from the 15 EU nations and other 13 European nations met on the eve of summit of all European nations to discuss the establishment of a EU border police force to tackle the issue of illegal immigrants.
Italian Interior Minister Scajola said interior ministers of these EU nations and the other 13 EU-candidate nations will focus their discussion on the finding of a study regarding the establishment of a common police force to guard the EU exterior border.
Scajola said the top priority of this police force will be to guard all the airports. These airports, said he, are exactly the main passages through which most of illegal immigrants enter the EU territory.
In an interview with Italian News Agency, he said: "According to our analysis, the airports are obviously the main passages to enter the territory and are therefore the places at the highest risk."
Scajola said it is of top priority to coordinate their various different police forces if the nations want to ensure the security of the EU.
He said: "Our final goal is not necessarily to establish a single European police force but rather to facilitate an exchange of data and information among ourselves while standardizing police training."
Experts gathering here pointed out that there are still difficulties for Europe to establish a common border police force, but the main reason lies in the political and legal barriers that exist between the EU nations on one hand and the EU-candidate nations on the other.
The interior ministers attending the 4-hour conference today will discuss the 15 short, medium and long-term moves in hopes of reinforcing Europe's porous border, including international airports.
US Assesses Worst Consequence of India-Pakistan Nuclear War Could Be Loss of Millions of Lives
(AFP, Washington)  Citing the confidential assessment report from the Pentagon, a US defense official pointed out that if a nuclear war broke out between India and Pakistan, the worst scenario would be the loss of lives ranging from 9 million to 12 million.  That figure could merely be the instant death toll resulting from the nuclear war, not including the deaths from diseases, starvation and polluted water supplies that accompanied the war.
Recently, the relations between India and Pakistan in South Asia have been growing more and more tense over the disputed Kashmir.  As a result, the US defense intelligence updated this classified assessment report last week.
The official, who declined to be named, said that under the worst circumstances, in a short period of time "the death toll could range from 9 (million) to 12 million, and another 2 (million) to 6 million could be injured."
He said: "In the long run, all those things such as starvation, polluted water supplies and birth defects could happen."
The US official said the likelihood of the above scenario is based on the assumption that the number of nuclear weapons on each side matches the number of their targets while all weapons are successfully launched, resulting in surface explosions and dispersion of radioactive dust clouds.
Former Milwaukee Archbishop Offers Public Apology for Sex and Money Scandals
(AFP, Milwaukee, Wisconsin)  In a recent prayer service, the former Milwaukee Archbishop Weakland in the United States made a public apology for his exposed scandal of being sexually involved with a student more than 20 years ago.
Archbishop Weakland, who retired on May 24, expressed his regrets over this scandal arising from his "sins."
The 75-year-old priest said to hundreds of believers attending the prayer service in Milwaukee, Wisconsin: "I acknowledge and fully accept my responsibility for the inappropriate nature of my relationship with Mr. Paul Marcoux.  I apologize for any harm done to him."
However, Weakland did not admit having any sexual relationship with Paul Marcoux, though frankly confirming that the archdiocese once paid 450,000 US dollars in 1998 to buy over Marcoux.
In a recent exclusive TV interview, Marcoux accused Weakland of sexually assaulting him in 1979 when he, then a seminarian, went to consult with the archbishop about entering the priesthood.
Pilots Strike Grounds Planes, Aer Lingus' Future Hangs in the Air
(AFP, Dublin)  The Irish airline, Aer Lingus, said that at present, all parties involved are seeking solutions to the dispute that has led to the stoppage of flights.  Meanwhile, the company will continue to suspend its operation till the 3rd.
At this moment, the future of this state-owned company remains uncertain.
Aer Lingus said in a statement that the court has required the management and the pilots' union to attend an emergency meeting scheduled on the 1st.
However, the company indicated that given the current circumstances, it is unlikely that the company would resume its operation on the 3rd.
The company is not taking any flight reservation through June 5.
Since the weekend happened to fall on a bank holiday, the dispute has already caused general confusion for the air travel in Ireland.
Affected by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United Statres and the agricultural epidemic crisis in Ireland last year, demand for air travel has significantly decreased.  The current dispute only adds to the woes of Aer Lingus whose operation is already in great troubles.
Aer Lingus pilots went on a one-day strike on May 30.  More than 100,000 travelers were affected.
The company refuses to resume operation before the pilots accept the new working conditions and agree to cooperate with the company's survival plan.
The plan includes a lay-off of 2,000 employees and a pay freeze for the remaining 4,000.
Aer Lingus Airlines lost 150 million euros (140 million US dollars) last year and about 20 million euros in the first four months of this year.
WHO: Great Progress in TB Prevention and Treatment Seen in India and China
(AFP, Washington)  The World Health Organization said that in China and India, the two countries whose combined TB cases account for one third of the world's total, great progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of this infectious disease.
At a 3-day conference on this respiratory disease, the WHO has endorsed a study that illustrates that "strong political commitment, adequate financial resources and sound technology" have significantly reduced the burden of tuberculosis borne by India and China.
Each year tuberculosis kills more than 2 million people.
An official from the WHO's Stop-TB Program said: "In our opinion, we must first win the battles in India and China in order to truly reduce TB cases in the world."
The WHO said in a statement that thanks to DOTS, a five-point public health strategy that calls for government commitment to the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis, in these two countries, "even in areas where the technology and public health infrastructure are inadequate, the diagnosis and cure of this infectious disease have still achieved a considerably high rate."
By the year 2000, 10 years after DOTS strategy went into operation, China had evaluated 8 million suspected TB cases and cured 1.3 million people infected with the disease with a cure rate as high as 90%.
In addition, the lives of about 30,000 infected patients were saved through the benefits of this strategy program.
Nearly half of India's population of about 1 billion are under the coverage of DOTS.  The cure rate for tuberculosis has exceeded 80%.
US FBI Agents Take Actions against Underwater Terrorism
(AFP, Miami)  US FBI agents have taken underwater anti-terrorist actions and sought the help from the diving industry in their detection of possible terrorist activities so as to "develop an offensive scuba diving capability."
The FBI has begun a nationwide canvass of shops of scuba diving gear, requesting them to report any suspicious students or customers.
They have also turned their attention to a list of 2 million people around the world who studied scuba diving during the past three years.
In Florida known for its coral reefs and recreational scuba diving, some scuba diving business owners were snickering at an instructor's so-called "ridiculous conception directly taken from James Bonds' movie episodes."
But the conception may not be entirely out of touch with reality.
"The notion of underwater terrorists is nothing new at all," said Austin, who owns a scuba diving shop in Miami that provides diving training and sells a whole line of recreational scuba diving gear from fins to spearguns.
He said: "For instance, both the US navy and the navies in other countries have underwater demolition teams.
Whatever good people can do, bad people can do as well."
FBI agents recently paid a visit to Austin.
Like other scuba diving shop owners in Florida, Austin did not receive any specific instruction as to whom and what he should look for.
He said: "After Sept. 11, anyone would by instinct not fail to watch out more closely for certain types of people."
Austin said: "If an Arab comes to my shop hoping to attend a class for scuba diving, I will not take him after careful consideration; however, if he starts to look for large quantities of diving equipment, I will report to the appropriate authorities."
Earlier this month, FBI issued a warning: "various types of terrorists have already sought to develop an offensive scuba diving capability."
Jennifer Lopez to Play Superhero Shrink in New Movie
(AFP, Los Angeles)  According to the weekly Hollywood Reporter, Singer-actress Latina star Jennifer Lopez has made it a deal to take Columbia Pictures' new comedy "Shrink!"  She will both star in and produce the movie.
Jennifer Lopez, who will celebrate her 32nd birthday next month, will play the role of a superhero "turned" shrink in the comedy.
Columbia Pictures announced today that the new movie "Shrink" will star Jennifer Lopez, who will also be the movie's producer at the same time.
Other details about the script and the selection of a director, supporting cast, and so on are still to be finalized by Columbia Pictures.
The story for "Shrink" is based on an Internet comic strip by Rob Liefeld.  It depicts a superhero, originally endowed with supernatural powers, who decides to change her profession to become a shrink, providing psychological counseling and guidance exclusively to other superheroes.
To increase the hilarity of this comedy, Columbia Pictures is going to follow the mode of "Shrek," one of the top box office hits of last year, to make jokes out of classic scenes and well-known characters taken from other movies or fairy tales so as to bring viewers pleasant surprises.
Millions of Subjects All over Britain Celebrate Queen's Golden Jubilee
(AFP, London)  Amidst the cheering of millions of her subjects, the British Queen Elizabeth II today thanked her country and people for their support at the 4-day celebrations of her Golden Jubilee that marks the 50th anniversary of her accession to the throne.
After a whole day of parades, grand festivities and concerts, Elizabeth II said, as a British Queen, she "felt gratitude, respect and pride" on this occasion of celebrating the 50th anniversary of her accession to the throne.
The celebrations culminated with a grand finale of a fly-past over Buckingham Palace by a Concorde and about a dozen of RAF jets that performed a graceful split formation in the air.
At City of London's Guildhall, the Queen addressed to the distinguished guests attending the celebrations: "It has been an unforgettable 50 years by any standards."
"There have been ups and downs in 50 years of life," said the Queen.
However, she added: "Looking back at the history of the last 50 years, I think we are justified in feeling proud."
The Queen also praised highly her family.
She said: "Over the years, my children and my family have given me boundless love and whole-hearted assistance, especially in recent months."
The Queen was referring to the successive deaths of her younger sister Princess Margaret and her mother, the British Queen Mother.
In his speech, British Prime Minister Blair extolled the Queen as a person with unifying power and "boundless enthusiasm."
Blair said: "No matter how big ups and downs you have had in your own life, no matter whether the country is faced with joy or crisis, no one ever doubts your commitment to serving Britain."
Police said about a million people in London got out to the streets to personally experience the joy of the celebrations of the Queen's Golden Jubilee.
Reynolds Tobacco Company Fined 20 Million US Dollars for Illegal Ads
(AFP, San Diego, California)  California officials said that Reynolds, the No. 2 US tobacco company, has been fined 20 million US dollars by a San Diego judge for running cigarette ads in magazines in an illegal attempt to lure youths aged from 12 to 17 into smoking.
The ruling judge Prager said under the terms of the 1998 agreement signed by the 46 US states, tobacco companies are barred from running cigarette ads in popular teenager magazines and from targeting youths.
Some time earlier, three tobacco companies, the makers of Camel, Winston and Salem, violated the terms; yet Reynolds still followed suit and did not scale down in any way the cigarette ad campaign targeting the youths.
The California's Attorney General Lockyer served as the prosecutor in this case.  After three weeks of trial, the ruling judge ordered Reynolds to pay a fine of 20 million US dollars in addition to all attorney and litigation fees.
In the future, Reynolds must also take specific measures to effectively comply with the 1998 agreement.
The 1998 master settlement agreement bans running cigarette ads on bulletins and buses as well as limits the size of other cigarette ad bulletins.  In addition, it restricts the giant cigarette makers from paying the media to promote their products or sponsoring youth sports games.
Lockyer said while other tobacco companies have long agreed not to advertise in magazines with over 15% readership of youth aged from 12 to 17, Reynolds has been reluctant to do so.
It was only a month ago that a Los Angeles court fined Reynolds 14.8 million US dollars for handing out free cigarettes worth over 100,000 US dollars at events in which children also participated.
US Labor Department Report on Employment Rate Shows Economy Is Recovering but at a Slow Pace
(AFP, Washington)  According to a US government report, there are signs that the US job market is recovering, although the pace of recovery is extremely slow, indicating the overall US economy is still struggling out of recession.
Labor Department said, in May there was an increase of about 41,000 job opportunities in the United States, while the unemployment rate dropped by 0.2% to 5.8%.
This is the biggest increase in non-farm job opportunities since February 2001 and is also the second straight month in the increase of employment following 12 consecutive months of steady decrease of employment.
Unemployment rate is lower than Wall Street expected, but the number of newly-created job opportunities is smaller than many expected.  According to economists, the newly created job opportunities are not enough to significantly promote the economic growth.
Analysts said only a robust increase in job opportunities can lead to consumer spending, which in turn promotes the economic growth.
Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors said the report from the Labor Department is surely good news, but it is just not good enough.
Although there is an increase in job opportunities, the pace of increase is just yet too slow.
Mubarak: Creation of a Palestinian State Key to Peace in the Middle East
(AFP, Washington)  Egyptian President Mubarak insisted that the creation of a Palestinian state under US pressure will help to achieve peace in the Middle East, but US President Bush refused to offer a specific timetable for the creation of the Palestinian state.
In an exclusive videotaped interview with CBS, Mubarak said: "To establish a Palestinian state right beside Israel is the best guarantee for peace to both sides."
He said: "We must find solutions to this plan, otherwise we will be in a mess."
Last weekend Mubarak and Bush met at Camp David to discuss the Mideast crisis.
Today Bush met with Israeli Prime Minister Sharon at the White House to hold further talks on the Mideast crisis.
Bush is trying to finalize the US government's Mideast policy and to lay the foundation for an international peace conference in the coming few months.
Mubarak added in an exclusive video-taped interview with Fox News: "The United States is the key to the peace process in the Middle East."
The Egyptian president thinks that both Israeli and Palestinian peoples need the United States to help them reach an agreement.  If Israel and Palestine are left alone to solve the problem, "they will accomplish nothing."
He pointed out that the conflict in Northern Ireland is the best example of success when the US mediation resulted in an agreement by both parties involved in the conflict.
Mubarak also called for Bush to pass the message to Sharon: "Destruction, use of force, slaughter and revenge will never bring about peace."
Costa Beats Ferrero and Claims Crown at French Open
(AFP, Paris)  The famous Spanish athlete Costa sustained 4 sets of intense games on the 9th and beat his fellow Spaniard rival Ferrero 3-1, claiming the crown in Men's Singles Championship Final at French Open and winning his first career Grand Slam laurel.
The conference's twentieth-seeded Costa spent 2 hours and 30 minutes in overpowering Ferrero, his fellow master player on red clay, for a 6-1, 6-0, 4-6, 6-3 victory.
The game was temporarily suspended for 20 minutes in the first set because of rain.
The conference's eleventh-seeded Ferrero, who did not seem to be in his best shape in the game, played in a somewhat awkward way.  Although he tried his hardest to fight back, he had to come to terms with his second place due to his double faults as well as excessive unforced errors and frequently broken serves.
Ferrero sprained his ankle in the first and second rounds of the Men's Singles.
It is the first time for both Costa and Ferrero to have entered the Grand Slam.  This is also the 12th tournament title Costa has won in his career as a professional tennis player.
The 26-year-old Costa hasn't claimed any championship in any games, either big or small, in the past three years.  His ranking in the world last year even went down to the 40th.
Costa fought his way all through to the tournament final, successively beating the Brazilian tennis king Kuerten the Iron Man and Corretja, the Spaniard player on red clay who won the second place at the French Open last year.  Winning the crown at this French Open will move Costa' ranking in the world way up to the 2nd.
This is Costa's 26th try for a Grand Slam title.  When there is a will, there will be a way.  He has now finally fulfilled his wish of returning home with his championship trophy.  Before this, even when he was at his best at the Grand Slam, he never went beyond the quarterfinals in which he played at the French Open respectively in 1995 and 2000, and the Australian Open in 1997.
Rumsfeld Accuses Iraq of Actively Developing Biological Weapons
(AFP, Manama)  US Defense Secretary Rumsfeld directly accused Iraqi President Saddam Hussein of being "a world-class liar."  He again mentioned the US accusation that Iraq is actively developing biological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
While denouncing Iraq in strong terms, the US government is working on a new set of national security strategy.  Defense officials said that the United States will take preemptive military actions against states that support terrorism and seek to develop weapons of mass destruction.
Rumsfeld told hundreds of military personnel assembled at the headquarters of the US Fifth Fleet here: "If you want to know a world class liar, it's Saddam Hussein.
He's an expert liar."
Rumsfeld's comments were prompted by an Iraqi statement issued on the 9th which vows that Baghdad is ready to prove that it has no secret program to develop nuclear weapons nor possesses any chemical or biological weapons.
Rumsfeld said: "He is lying."
Rumsfeld stressed that the United States is facing a new, more urgent threat in the form of states with weapons of mass destruction allied to shameless terrorist groups.
A US defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed a Washington Post report that in a new national security strategy, the United States is expected to take pre-emptive military actions to counter the above-described terrorist threat.
G8 Foreign Ministers Met in Canada to Discuss Mideast Situation
(AFP, Whistler, Canada)  Foreign ministers from the G8 group of leading industrial nations met in the remote mountains in Whistler, Canada, to discuss the conflicts in the Middle East and South Asia and such other issues as threats of terrorist attacks.
Canada, the G8's rotating president, has invited foreign ministers of the United States, Russia, Britain, Italy, France, Germany and Japan to convene a 2-day meeting in Whistler, a ski resort northeast of Vancouver, British Columbia.
This foreign ministers' meeting will pave the way for the G8 Summit to be held from the 26th to the 27th in Kananaskis, a vacation resort in Alberta.
Kananaskis is located near Calgary.
Arriving in Whistler at the last minute, the US Secretary of State Powell immediately joined the other foreign ministers in the working session to discuss anti-terrorist operations, rising tensions in South Asia and the situation in Afghanistan.
The foreign ministers attending the meeting will hold heated discussions on the Middle East crisis over dinner on the 12th.
Quite a few G8 nations seem rather dissatisfied with the Bush administration's apparent support of Israeli Prime Minister Sharon's Mideast policy.
Canada said today that it will urge the G8 meeting to reach a consensus that it is necessary to hold a Middle East peace conference.
Two days ago, President Bush seemed opposed to this idea when he held talks with Sharon.
Making a public appearance on the 10th together with Sharon, Bush said when asked about the feasibility of holding a Middle East peace conference: "The situation is not yet ripe for the talks, because nobody has any confidence in the Palestinian government.
Bush's remark cast some doubt on whether the Middle East peace conference originally scheduled to convene this summer will eventually materialize as planned.
British Ex-Duchess of York Fergie to Host US TV Talk Show
(AFP, Los Angeles)  Media sources pointed out that the British ex-Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson has signed a contract with a US TV station to host a daily talk show for the station starting next year.
Sarah, the auburn-haired ex-wife of the British Queen's second son Andrew and nicknamed Fergie, has already reached an agreement with a subdivision of the French media giant Vivendi.
Rosenberg, president of Universal Television Enterprises, said: "With her charming personality and talent for hosting, Sarah is very suitable for a career in television."
He said: "She is just like the girl next door, extremely amiable and also with an inspiring life story.  She holds a great appeal both to viewers and the TV station.  We will work together to produce this program and fully tap her warmth, humor, sincerity and passion for life."
In order to raise funds to pay the debts incurred by her huge expenses, Fergie started to do TV commercials in the United States.  She even hosted a short-lived talk show in the U.K., causing a series of controversies there.
At present, Fergie lives in the United States most of the time, because people there like her natural and simple style.
She said the show seems customized for her and offers her opportunities to meet some interesting people in the movie and art circles.
Japan's Economy can Benefit Enormously from World Cup, Said Bank of Japan Governor
(AFP, Tokyo, June 14)  Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami said today that Japan's economy can benefit enormously from co-hosting the World Cup soccer tournament.
Masaru Hayami pointed out: "It is difficult to accurately assess the impact of the World Cup on Japan's economy.  However, since the tournament is held at a time when economic activities in Japan are just starting to show signs of recovery, I think it will be the factor supporting this trend."
A think tank for Japan's advertising giant Dentsu estimates that the World Cup would bring Japan at least about 3.2 trillion yen (25 billion US dollars) of derivative economic effects if Japan makes the final eight.
Meanwhile, Masaru Hayami noted that Bank of Japan will continue to monitor closely whether the recent positive sign in the manufacturing industry will expand to other industries such as household appliances and non-banking industries.
Although the US stock market fluctuates due to its uncertainty whether capital spending and consumer spending are sustainable, Masaru Hayami said: "I think the US economy is on its way to recovery."
Masaru Hayami warned: "However, we must watch closely for any development in the US capital spending and consumer spending."
Bank of Japan upgraded its economic assessment for the fourth consecutive month during the last six months and noted that Japan's economy will start to recover as a result of the increase in exports and acceleration in production.
Ruling Party in South Korea Faces Huge Obstacles after Setback in Local Elections
(AFP, Seoul)  Following the crushing defeat in last week's local elections and the embezzlement scandals involving the two sons of President Kim Dae-jung who founded the party, Millennium Democratic Party, the ruling party in South Korea, is heading toward a break-up.
The reformists attribute the major setback in elections suffered by the MDP on the 13th to the scandals involving Kim Dae-jung's aide and sons.  Now they hope to establish a new political party.
During this election, the opposition party, Grand National Party, scored a sweeping victory in major provinces and cities, which is yet another most recent sign that Kim Dae-jung's reputation is on the decline.
The result of an opinion poll released today in Korean Central Daily shows that of the 60 MDP members of National Assembly interviewed, 42 are in favor of founding a new party to be headed by Roh Moo-hyun, the party's presidential candidate.
A senior member of National Assembly said: "We must work harder to draw a clear line between the party and the president."
At present, the MDP is still under the control of Kim Dae-jung's long-trusted followers and key aides.
However, Roh Moo-hyun has vowed to reform the MDP.  Pundits predict he will change the name of the party and distance it from Kim Dae-jung.
Kim Dae-jung withdrew from the party last month, claiming he hopes to stay above the limitations of the party during his last few months in office.
US and South Korea to Hold High-level Talks on Resumption of Dialogs between Washington and Pyongyang
(AFP, Seoul, June 17)  Officials said that just as signs are showing that the United States is getting ready to resume dialogs with North Korea, South Korea will send a senior security official to Washington this week to hold high-level talks with the United States.
Chong Wa Dae indicated that Yim Sung-joon, presidential secretary for foreign affairs and national security, will meet with the US National Security Advisor Rice on the 20th in Washington.
It is expected that the upcoming resumption of dialogs between the United States and North Korea will be the main topic of discussion in Rice's talks with Yim Sung-joon.
South Korean officials said they believe that the United States will soon resume substantial dialogs with Pyongyang.
The US special envoy Pritchard will meet with North Korean officials in New York and discuss his possible trip to North Korea.
A Chong Wa Dae official said: "We will hold a high-level talk with the United States at the time when the United States is going to reopen dialogs with North Korea."
"We can offer the United States our experience in talks between South and North Koreas and confirm the US position on dialogs with North Korea."
South Korea has been actively seeking to reach a  reconciliation with North Korea so as to eliminate the stand-off between the two sides since the 1950-53 Korean War.  It has also requested the United States to resume dialogs with North Korea.
When leaders in both South and North Koreas held a historic summit in June 2000, both sides reached agreements on a number of peace plans.
However, the reconciliation process between South and North Koreas was stalled last year as President George W. Bush adopted a hardline position on North Korea after he took office.
Marriott Hotel Group Aggressively Opening More Hotels in Asia
(AFP, Bangkok)  The US Marriott Hotel Group plans to open 10 new hotels in Asia over the next 18 months in response to a rapid tourism rebound in the Asian region.
John W. Marriott III, executive vice president of Marriott International Inc., pointed out at a marketing conference held in Bangkok that Thailand is a key part of the corporation's Asian growth strategy.
Thailand's English daily newspaper "The Nation" quoted him as saying: "Thailand is very important to us.
We will continue to expand our hotel service starting from Asia, but we will also open additional hotels in other regions as well."
Marriott Group, one of the largest hotel groups in the world, has more than 70 chain hotels in Asia.
It is reported that even when the global tourism has apparently slipped since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States last year, Marriott Hotel has still added 40,000 rooms worldwide.
Senior Vice President Wolff said that room rates have remained low since last year, but occupancy rates have much improved.
He said: "In terms of occupancy rates, several major cities, including Hong Kong, Bangkok and Singapore, are performing pretty well.  Hotel business is gradually coming back.  Room rates will naturally improve when the demand rises."
Israel to Launch a Series of Military Actions after Bus Attack in Jerusalem
(AFP, Jerusalem)  While US President Bush is working on a new peace strategy on Israel and Palestine, Israel has decided to launch "a series of military actions" in retaliation for the attack on a bus by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem today.
19 people were killed in the attack in addition to the attacker.
A public radio station, quoting government sources, reported that the small cabinet headed by Israeli Prime Minister Sharon has also discussed the possibility of expelling the Palestinian leader Arafat's senior aide instead of Arafat himself.
It said, the Israeli military actions will be on a larger scale than that of the recent army attack, though not as large as that of Israel's Operation Defensive Shield on the West Bank of the Jordan River from March 29 to May 10.
Palestinian security officials said that on the ground, the Israeli armored forces, supported by helicopters, entered the Palestinian self-rule town of Jenin on the West Bank of the Jordan River tonight.
They said, about 50 automobiles, including military vehicles, drove through the town en route to the refugee camp in Jenin under the cover of helicoper fire.
So far there hasn't been any report of casualties from Jenin.
Israel considers Jenin as a haven for terrorists.  Jenin Refuge Camp was the No. 1 target of Israel's Operation Defensive Shield.
The public radio station said, Sharon and Defense Minister Eliezer held talks with the army and security officials prior to the small cabinet meeting and decided to retaliate for the bus bombing that took place at a rush hour in Jerusalem.
However, it is also widely rumored in Jerusalem that Sharon will put his retaliation on hold until President Bush announces his plan to end the 21-month-long conflict between Israel and Palestine.
Two Teenager Suspects Arrested for Internet Cafe Arson in Beijing
(AFP, Beijing)  Two teenager suspects have been arrested on suspicion of arson in an Internet cafe in Beijing that killed 24 people.
An official from Beijing Municipal Government said in a statement today that the two teenagers Zhang and Song, currently aged 13 and 14 respectively, were caught on Tuesday.
The Internet cafe "Lanjisu" located on University Road in Haidian District went up in a blaze early Sunday morning, killing 24 adolescents who were either secondary school students or college students.
According to media reports, among the dead, 9 were classmates in the nearby Beijing Science and Technology Institute.
The victims were trapped at the time of the incident on the second floor of this unlicensed Internet cafe.  The windows were all blocked with iron bars while the only exit was locked.
According to reports, another 13 on the scene were injured.  Many of them were seriously burned.
The above official statement said: "According to the investigation by the Public Security Bureau, both teenagers, the 13-year-old Zhang and 14-year-old Song, are students in Beijing and frequently played truant after their parents were divorced."
The statement said: "Both admitted that they went to Internet cafes very often.
Two weeks ago they had a dispute with the owner of Lanjisu.  In retaliation, they bought gasoline and set the fire.  Both admitted to these facts."
US Trade Deficit Hits Record High, Shaking the Value of US Dollar
(AFP, Washington)  The slow recovery of the US economy and the large volume of imports coupled with investments overseas have pushed the trade and cash deficit to a new high, pounding the value of the US dollar.
Guatieri, a Chicago-based economist at Bank of Montreal, said: "If the market needs any proof that the US dollar is overvalued, doubtlessly it has got that proof this morning."
The US trade deficit in April, aggravated by the large quantity of oil imports, increased 10.7% over the previous month, hitting a record high of 35.9 billion US dollars.
In the January-March quarter, the current account deficit climbed to an unprecedented 112.5 billion US dollars, an 18.3% increase over the 95.1 billion US dollars of the previous quarter.
The current account reflects trade in goods and services, the flow of stocks and bonds investment and one-way currency transfers such as foreign aid payments.
Meanwhile, the euro rose to as high as 96.26 US cents, exceeding 96 US cents for the first time in two years.
Guatieri said "the sweeping deterioration" in April's trade balance and the record high deficit in the first quarter current account have caused investors to lose confidence in the US dollar.
Israel-Arab Conflict Escalates; Casualties Rise while Israeli Military Occupies Five West Bank Towns
(AFP, Jerusalem)  A few hours after the armed mobsters shot and killed five Israelis on a Jewish settlement, Israel's tanks, pressing ahead with a new policy of seizing Palestinian territories, re-took another West Bank town of Nablus in retaliation for the Palestinians' violent attack.
Shortly before Israel took the offensive on Nablus, a gunbattle broke out in the Gaza Strip.  The Israeli border guards, when attacked at Erez border crossing, shot and killed three Palestinians.
Palestinian leader Arafat earlier also called for "no more wars," and expressed his belief that he can reach a peace agreement with the hardliner Israeli Prime Minister Sharon.
However, the most recent violence has forced US President Bush to postpone the announcement of his new Mideast strategy as he is worried that nobody will listen to his new strategy.
According to Palestinian security officials, more than 10 tanks and armored personnel carriers drove over a kilometer into eastern Nablus, while other troops entered Nablus from other directions.
Israeli troops have occupied Jenin, Qalqilya, Bethlehem, Beitunia and Tulkarem, the five Palestinian self-rule towns in the West Bank.
These actions of occupation were intended as retaliation for the two suicide bombings on the 18th and 19th of this month in Jerusalem that had claimed the lives of 25 Israelis.
Five Israelis were killed last night on Itmar settlement near Nablus, including a mother and her three children.
AFP received an anonymous call saying Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for the attack.
Israeli Troops Open Fire on Marketplace in Jenin, 4 Palestinians Dead
(AFP, Jenin, West Bank)  Israeli troops opened fire on a market in Jenin in the West Bank, killing four Palestinians.  Townspeople in Jenin area at the time mistakenly thought the curfew had been lifted.
In the meantime, Prime Minister Sharon's government continued to move forward with reoccupation of the West Bank towns.
According to the Israeli government sources, in response to endless Palestinian attacks, Sharon's security cabinet decided to maintain its troops in Palestinian self-rule towns until Palestinian suicide bombings and frenzied shootings come to an end.
In the last 72 hours, there have been three incidents of Palestinian attacks.  More than 30 Israelis unfortunately died and 17 Palestinians were killed in the two suicide bombings and the attack on Jenin settlement in the West Bank on the 20th.
The most serious clash in the past 21 months broke out in the West Bank town of Jenin.
Palestinian medical personnel indicated that on the afternoon of the 21st, Israeli tanks shelled at a fruit and vegetable market in Jenin, killing 4 people, including a child.
In a rare move the Israeli military admitted that the tanks mistakenly opened fire and caused civilian casualties, vowing to investigate the case.
The military said in a statement that the tanks opened fire on a crowd of townspeople who mistakenly thought "curfew was over" while the soldiers in Jenin "were searching house-to-house for labs that manufacture explosives."
Irsheid, acting governor of Jenin, told Independence, an Israeli newspaper: "People thought the curfew was over."
"They were hungry and wanted to buy foods.  That's why they went to the market and then the Israeli troops opened fire."
A 13-year-old boy in Jenin was killed before dawn while five of his family members suffered injuries.
Pakistan Claims Soldier's Death Further Escalates India-Pakistan Tensions
(AFP, Islamabad)  The Pakistani military warned Sunday that after an unarmed Pakistani soldier was allegedly tortured and shot to death, tensions between Pakistan and its nuclear rival India again escalated.
The military spokesman Major General Qureshi said, although there has been some progress in easing the tensions between India and Pakistan, it has gone up in smoke because of this incident.  If India does not punish those involved, it may be accused of state-sponsoring a killing.
Qureshi told AFP: "No matter what cosmetic actions India has taken, they have not reduced the tensions at all."
He was referring to the recent diplomatic and military maneuvers by India aimed at easing the crisis.
He added: "This sufficiently shows that tensions are exactly what they were a month ago or a few months back.
There is no letting up in tensions at all."
Qureshi said there has been no official response from India yet after Pakistan called for India to investigate the death of the Pakistanian soldier Maqsood.
From what he indicated, after Maqsood was taken away from the no man's land between the two countries, he was tied up, interrogated by "third degree methods" and finally shot to death.
He said: "They need to take actions, otherwise it will be state-sponsored.
If the government is not involved in this incident, the government must take actions against the perpetrators."
India has denied any act of torture and said Maqsood was shot to death while attempting to cross into India.
However, Pakistan said Maqsood was kidnapped by a group of Indian soldiers after he rounded up a pair of runaway camels.
750 Dead or Missing in Floods in China
(AFP, Beijing)  Floods have devastated large areas in China.  According to official statistics, over 750 have been killed or missing.  A rescue agency pointed out that many victims live in the poorest areas in the country.
The most recent statistics released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs of China show that 453 have been confirmed dead in the floods in 8 provinces and cities.  In the worst-hit Shaanxi Province, 151 have been confirmed dead.
These figures do not include the additional number of 300 people believed to be missing in Shaanxi Province.  Jia Zhibang, the province's acting vice governor, thought they have "little chance of survival."
Such a high death toll even in the early phase of the flood season that lasts from June to September this year has caused people to worry that more people may die in floods this year than in the floods of 1998 that drowned over 4,000 people.
Statistics from the Ministry of Civil Affairs indicate that up till now, 57 million people have been affected by the floods; 800,000 buildings and houses have collapsed; and more than 2 million hectares of farm land have been inundated.
The Ministry disclosed that the floods have devastated a vast area of the country, from Shaanxi Province in the northwest, through Sichuan Province and Chongqing in the southwest, to Fujian Province and Jiangxi Province in the southeast.
A staff member named Liu, who works for China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation, said today that although the current death toll by floods is smaller than that of 1998, the affected area is much larger than in 1998.  In that year, 10 provinces and cities were ravaged by floods, but 19 provinces and cities are hit this year.
He pointed out that another characteristic of this year's floods is that many affected people are extremely poor and have almost no means to sustain their losses.
Liu said: "The poverty-stricken areas are especially hit hard in the first phase of the floods this year.  Many of those counties and cities are listed as the poorest in the country.
Some of the disaster areas are rendered inaccessible as roads have been broken by floods.  Many people have become homeless; and still many other flood victims are waiting for food and other relief items."
UMNO Announces Mahathir will Step down Next Year; Abdullah to Succeed Him
(AFP, Kuala Lumpur)  Malaysia's ruling party UMNO announced that Prime Minister Mahathir will step down next year and hand over his office to his deputy Abdullah.
UMNO Secretary General Yaakob said that Mahathir, who has stayed in power for 21 years, will resign after the summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference to be held here in October next year.
Yaakob said Mahathir "has decided to resign from all his positions at UMNO, Barisan Nasional Coalition and the government. "
On the 22nd, at the conclusion of the UMNO annual congress, Mahathir announced in tears his resignation from UMNO and his presidency of the ruling Nasional Coalition to a stunned Malaysia.
When the entire country of Malaysia was watching the live televised announcement of his resignation, Mahathir was quickly hustled off the chairman's podium by stunned UMNO party leaders into a secluded room.  When Abdullah returned to the conference hall, he said Mahathir has agreed to stay in office.
However, Mahathir himself didn't offer any further public explanation and went on a vacation trip to Italy the next day after throwing the whole country into a political turmoil.
Beneath the huge portrait of Mahathir and in the company of Abdullah and other UMNO leaders, Yaakob read at UMNO headquarters the statement clarifying Mahathir's future.
He said that Mahathir will take two months of vacation prior to his final resignation so as to facilitate a smooth transfer of power to Abdullah.
After this announcement, Abdullah, who serves both as vice prime minister and the vice president of UMNO, said in this live televised press conference: "(Nasional Coalition) Superior Council supports 100% (Mahathir's) this  decision."
Abdullah said: "There will be a smooth transfer of power during the entire process, but at present, he is still the prime minister."
He said: "If someone has speculated on a scramble for power, the speculation is groundless."
US Appellate Court Rules Pledge of Allegiance Unconstitutional
(AFP, San Francisco, June 27)  A US appellate court ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance that US pupils are required to recite every day before classes start is unconstitutional because it uses the name of God.
The shocking ruling made by the three judges in San Francisco is bound to set off strong repercussions from the US public.
The relation between the church and the state has long been a topic of major controversy in the United States.
The judges in the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals pointed out in the written ruling that the sentence containing "one nation, under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance demonstrates the government's support of religious intervention forbidden by the US Constitution.
An atheist filed the lawsuit with the Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in protest that his daughter has to recite the Pledge of Allegiance every morning in school.
His appeal case was accepted.
Citing a US Supreme Court judgement, Judge Goodwin noted in the ruling that schools are not allowed to hold religious prayers at the graduation ceremonies nor can students be compelled to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
Millions of US pupils aged from 5 to 11 must put their right hands across their chests and recite the Pledge of Allegiance in front of the US national flag every morning before classes start.
The controversial phrase "under God" was added to the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954 when Eisenhower was in office.
The pledger must pledge allegiance to "the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, with liberty and justice indivisible."
In the United States, the separation of church and state has always been an issue of controversy.  The ban of morning prayers by state schools has already caused strong repercussions in this nation known for its devout religious belief and patriotism.
The ruling, once effective, will impact public schools in the 8 Western states, the US Guam and northern Mariana Islands.
The case for sure will go to the US Supreme Court.
Accounting Fraud Scandals Rock Corporate America; President Bush Pledges Tough Penalties
(AFP, Washington)  A series of accounting fraud scandals in many US corporations is quickly escalating into a potential political storm, sending the White House, Congressmen, Securities Exchange Commission and prosecutors scrambling for actions, each vowing tough penalties for violators.
Although the Republican party has been a long-time supporter of corporate America, President Bush is trying to demonstrate his firm position.
He pledged tough penalties on corporations and chief officers who falsify accounts.
President Bush said in a political fund raiser meeting: "Just as we expect our schools to have high standards, we also expect our corporations to have high standards.  I will strictly enforce the laws so that high standards be maintained."
After the accounting fraud scandals of the WorldCom, Inc., the second largest US long distance service provider, were brought to light this week, President Bush gave the above tough talk once again to corporate America.
President Bush said: "Corporate America must understand that apart from making false accounting statements, inflating business revenue and hoping nobody ever knows, there is a higher calling out there, that is, you are responsible for this country."
Prior to President Bush's above remark, scandals of accounting fraud, inside trading and other malfeasance broke out in a number of US businesses, one of the most recent being Xerox Corporation's overstatement of business revenue.
North Korea Rejects Talks with South Korea after Naval Clash
(AFP, Seoul)  North Korea rejected talks after yesterday's fatal gunbattle at sea.  Meanwhile, it demands the unofficial maritime border with its rival South Korea be annulled.
South Korea's national news agency "Yonhap" reported without identifying the source that North Korean authorities released the message of rejecting talks this morning through Panmunjom, a truce village.
The UN Command, which has been monitoring the situation in the front lines of South and North Koreas ever since the 1950-53 Korean War, proposed talks between the two sides after yesterday's gunbattle at sea.
The military clash took place in the disputed maritime border area in the Yellow Sea along the west coast of the Korean Peninsula.
South Korea pointed out four of its soldiers died in the sea battle while one was missing and 19 were injured.
North Korean authorities frankly admitted that there were casualties on its side, yet did not reveal any details.  However, a South Korean military official said today that at least 30 North Korean sailors were killed or injured.
The UN Command headed by the United States once called for a general-level conference of UNC Armistice Committee, pointing out that North Korea has already violated the Armistice between the two Koreas.
Yonhap reported that North Korea rejected the proposal, pointing out that the Northern Limit Line(NLL), the unofficial maritime border between the two Koreas, must be first annulled.
Yonhap reported North Korea said in a phone call to UNC secretary general Colonel Glasser that the Yellow Sea "battle was entirely caused by the Northern Limit Line that is unilaterally drawn by South Korea and bears no relevance to the Armistice Agreement."
The message is: "If you want to hold meetings with us, you must first annul the Northern Limit Line."
Both the UN Command and South Korea's Ministry of Naitional Defense refused to make any comments on the report.
South Korea on High Alert along Border of Two Koreas
(AFP, Seoul)  As South Korean President Kim Dae-jung went to attend the closing ceremony of the World Cup soccer tournament in Japan, South Korea's armed forces are maintaining a high level of alert against North Korea today.
After navy vessels of South and North Koreas had a fierce gunbattle in the Yellow Sea in which 4 South Korean soldiers were killed, 1 was missing and 22 were injured, tensions remain high at the Cold War front.
South Korean officials said the North Korean military is apparently on alert too, but their ships still stay within their own territorial waters.
A spokesman from South Korean National Defense Ministry said: "Our armed forces are still maintaining a high level of alert, but there seems to be no particular action on the part of the North Korean military."
Kim Dae-jung issued an order of high security alert before he headed for Japan to attend the World Cup soccer finals.
The Nobel peace prize winner said: "The government will take necessary measures so that the people can engage in their work without concerns."
Kim Dae-jung will keep in touch with Defense Minister Kim Dong-shin via hotline during his 3-day stay in Japan.
The naval clash between South and North Koreas has escalated tensions between the two sides, making their relationship plunge to the lowest point since Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il held the historic summit meeting two years ago.
The 20-minute sea battle between South and North Koreas took place at a time when the World Cup soccer tournament is drawing to a close in South Korea and Japan.
South Korea has demanded an apology from North Korea, believing the clash must have been provoked by the North Korean military.
However, North Korea instead accused South Korea of firing the first shot.
US Cassini Spacecraft Runs Well on Mission to Study Saturn
Xinhua News Agency, Los Angeles, May 21(Reporter Zhang Xiaojun)  A recent news release from NASA said that the Cassini spacecraft on mission to study Saturn is currently running well and approaching the planned orbit around Saturn.
Program Manager Robert Mitchell at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said that for months the lens of the camera carried on Cassini had been frosted with a thin haze, which affected the quality of its picture-taking.
Using a built-in heater in the camera, scientists conducted a 60-day warming treatment.  The most recent photos sent back to Earth show that the problem has already been fixed.
As of now, Cassini has sent back a large number of photos of important research value.
In December 2000, when Cassini flew over Jupiter, the spacecraft's narrow-angle camera took accurate pictures of Jupiter.
Weighing 5.67 tons, the Cassini spacecraft was launched into sky on October 15, 1997 from Cape Canaveral in Florida, beginning its 7-year-long, 3.5 billion-kilometer trip to Saturn.
Under the force of gravity, the "Cassini" spacecraft flew by Venus twice, brushed past Earth by 900 km in August 1999, and then flew by Jupiter.  It is scheduled to enter the orbit around Saturn in July 2004 to start a 4-year exploration of Saturn's mysterious ring system and its moons.
The probe "Huygens" carried on the "Cassini" spacecraft will land on the surface of Saturn's satellite Titan, the largest of all Saturn's moons.
Scientists have long conjectured that oceans of liquid methane exist on Titan.
Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority Praises EU's Pledge for Aid
Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, May 22 (Reporter Ren Feng)  Dr. Ashraf Ghani, director of Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority, praised the EU for its pledge of specific aid to Afghanistan at a press conference held on the 22nd.
Ghani said, the EU pledged 15 million euros to the UN Development Program for assisting Afghanistan and at the same time also pledged 15 million euros to the "World Bank Trust Fund" for assisting Afghan Interim Government to solve its budget difficulties.
Ghani told the reporters that Afghan Interim Government submitted the 2002 government budget totaling 460 million US dollars at the executive group meeting for Afghan assistance held in April; as the government has very little revenue, the budget has a shortfall of about 400 million US dollars that needs to be covered by aids from the international community.
Ghani expressed his appreciation that the EU has taken the lead in making a substantial pledge to help Afghan Interim Government solve its budget problem, which, he thought, is of great importance in ensuring a normal operation of the Afghan government and in enhancing its credibility.
Nepal Announces Dissolution of Parliament
Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, May 22 (Reporter Song Dejun)  The Press Secretariat of Nepal's Royal Palace issued a news release on the night of the 22nd that based on the recommendation by Prime Minister Deuba of the Royal Government of Nepal, King Gyanendra has announced the immediate dissolution of the Nepali parliament.
At the same time, King Gyanendra also announced that the current government headed by Deuba will continue to stay in power until November 13 this year when a new administration is established through the national election.
Deuba proposed earlier to extend by six months the national state of emergency which expires on the 25th of this month so that Nepal's government army can launch a nationwide crackdown on the anti-government armed forces and eventually wipe them out.
However, under Nepal's Constitution, Deuba's proposal needs to be approved by more than two-thirds of the parliament members before it can be implemented.
It was originally scheduled that the Nepali parliament convenes on the 23rd to discuss Deuba's proposal.
However, the ruling Congress party as well as other parties have continuously held meetings in recent days, unanimously opposing the extension of the state of emergency.
In the meantime, they also indicated that they will openly oppose this government's decision at the meeting to be held on the 23rd.
Therefore, Deuba proposed to the king to dissolve the parliament.
Housing Price Hikes Accelerating in Britain
Xinhua News Agency, London, May 22 (Reporter Liu Guishan)  According to the news released on the 22nd by a monitoring institution that monitors over 4,000 real estate agents in England and Wales, the housing prices in Britain have been increasing at the fastest speed in two years, making people concerned that a crisis may be imminent in the real estate market that has been hot for over a year.
The survey by the institution shows that in the first four months of this year, the real estate price in Britain rose by 7.7%.  April alone saw an increase of 2.6%.
The survey by the British Nationwide Building Society, moreover, shows the increase in the housing price in April reached 3.4%.
The monitoring institution thinks that at present, the inventory of houses has dropped to the lowest point in the past 23 years while the numbers of rental property buyers and first-time buyers have been growing, indicating a housing bubble is in the making in the British real estate market.
Given the current economic situation, it is likely that Britain will raise the interest rate this year and next year.  If the interest rate is up 2 percentage points, the real estate bubble will burst.
The real estate market in Britain has been very hot since last year when the annual rate of increase in housing prices exceeded 10%.
The dwindling inventory of houses, the dramatic interest rate cut, and high employment rate all contributed to this situation.
Analysts are concerned that since there is no sign yet of any slowing down of this price hike, the prospect of the British real estate market as where it is heading now is far from optimistic.

During their talks, Kim Dae-jung introduced the recent situation of the Korean Peninsula.
Mahathir said that the Malaysian government supports South Korea's policy on North Korea that is aimed to bring about reconciliation and cooperation between the two Koreas.

US Amusement Park Employee Died Underneath Roller Coaster
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 27  An accident took place in an amusement park in Austell, Georgia on the 26th when an amusement park employee, for no apparent reason, entered a restricted area underneath a roller coaster and was fatally struck in the head by the dangling leg of a passenger speeding by on a roller coaster car.
At this moment, the management officials at the amusement park still cannot understand how the 58-year-old employee could get into an enclosed restricted area underneath the roller coaster,
because there is a clearly-marked sign of No Entry to anyone including employees.
It is reported that it was a 14-year-old girl seated on the front car of the ride whose leg struck the employee.
After the accident, she was hospitalized for the treatment of her leg and is now released from the hospital.

Chile Contemplates Filing Complaint against US Farm Subsidies
Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, May 28 (Reporter Shen An)  Lagos, an official from Chilean Foreign Ministry in charge of international economic relations, said on the 28th that the Chilean government is contemplating filing a complaint with the WTO either together with other Latin American countries or single-handedly against the United States' increase of subsidies on its farm products.
According to the Chilean media reports, Lagos, who is currently attending an APEC meeting in Mexico, said in his address to the press media that although Chile is negotiating right now with the United States on free trade and is hoping to reach an agreement as soon as possible, Chile has always demanded that the United States remove subsidies on its farm products, and will not make any concession in this respect.
Lagos said that Chile is studying the possibility of filing a complaint with the WTO against the United States.  He said, the US practice "does not fit our interest.  We may file the complaint together with other countries, or we may file the complaint single-handedly.  There is no doubt about that."
Chile is one of the major exporters of farm products in the world with an annual export of farm products worth about 4.9 billion US dollars, of which one third is exported to the US market.
According to a study by the Latin America Economic System, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay are among the most affected in the Latin American region by the United States' increase on farm subsidies.
The governments of Brazil and Argentina have already indicated that they will file a complaint with the WTO against the United States on this issue.
US Offers Huge Reward for Capture of ASG Leaders
Xinhua News Agency, Manila, May 29 (Reporter Yang Zhongyi)  Francis Ricciardone, US Ambassador to the Philippines, announced here on the 29th that the US government has offered 5 million US dollars for the capture of five ASG leaders.
Ricciardone said the reward is part of the US government's "Rewards for Justice Program" and hopes it will help the Philippine government to arrest and convict those terrorists who committed atrocities on the Filipinos and Americans.
He also called on the Philippine people to provide information through the hotline in the US embassy to assist with the capture of the ASG members.
The five ASG leaders, for whose capture the reward money is offered, include their organization's leader Khadafi Janjalani and spokesman Abu Sabaya.
Last year, the Philippine government offered 1 million pesos (about 20,000 US dollars) for the capture of any of these five ASG leaders.
The Philippine military has stationed over 5,000 troops on Basilan Island in the southern Philippines and also tried to hunt down ASG members with the help of the United States, yet so far it has little success.
At present, the ASG members are still holding an American couple and a Fillipina hostage on Basilan Island.
Currently, about 1,000 US soldiers are stationed in the South of the Philippines, participating in the Filipino-US joint military exercise that started in January this year and assisting the Philippine military in their crackdown of the ASG members.
After the Sept. 11 incident last year, the United States listed the ASG as a terrorist organization that is allegedly linked to "Al Qaeda" network.

Output of China's Footwear Industry Ranks 1st in World
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 8 (Huang Mei, Xie Chuguang)  In the international footwear market, the output of China's footwear industry has taken up nearly 50% of the world's total.  In the global footwear trade, the export volume of China's footwear has also accounted for 25%.  Both figures are ranked 1st in the world.
This is what reporters learned at the First Symposium on Strategies of Export of Footwear from China's Coastal Provinces held recently in Guangzhou.
Statistics from the Customs show that in 2001, China exported 4.072 billion pairs of shoes with an export value of 10.096 billion US dollars, up 2.55% and 2.48% respectively over the previous year.
Industry insiders think that in the international footwear market, footwear made in China plays a fairly important role.
However, there exist many problems in the production and export in China's footwear industry, the chief one being the low export prices.
Officials from China Light Industry Import and Export General Company pointed out that at present, the average price of the similar type of shoes made in China is not only far below that of those made in countries or regions such as Italy, Brazil, South Korea and Taiwan, but has also fallen even below the price of those made in countries such as Vietnam.
Meanwhile, the export price tends to drop further.
Guangdong Province, reportedly the largest shoe maker in China, has a current annual output of nearly 3 billion pairs, accounting for one-third of the world's annual total.
However, the footwear industry in Guangdong is also faced with the same problems as mentioned above.
In response to these problems, experts are calling for China's footwear industry to further improve the quality, speed up product upgrading, work harder on establishing its own brand names and lay more emphasis on expanding overseas markets.

Romania Reinforces Old Buildings to Relieve Residents' Concerns
Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 8 (Reporter Zhou Rongzi)  Newly-erected scaffolds are being seen at three construction sites in downtown Bucharest.
Workers are not building new houses but are reinforcing the old residential buildings.
Based on the three months of inspection and technical evaluation conducted by the appropriate Romanian experts, the municipal government of Bucharest decided in early June to reinforce and repair those buildings that have been out of repair for years and suffered a few slight cracks in several earthquakes in order to prevent the buildings from collapsing in the possible future earthquakes and consequently causing casualties.
The three residential buildings being reinforced were all built in the 1930s and have a total of 72 households.
Before the reinforcement, 70% of the exterior layer has already peeled off.
A six-storied building located on Waxili Baowen Blvd. was built in 1930 and suffered partial structural damage in the 1977 earthquake.  However, the unique architectural style of this building has maintained its peculiar charm and never failed to draw the admiration of passers-by.
Given their age, the three above-mentioned buildings can no longer withstand the impact of another earthquake.
According to the experts' estimates, it will cost 100 US dollars/sq. m to reinforce and repair these old residential buildings.
It will be funded initially by the government's Ministry of Public Works, Transports and Housing and then paid back by the people living in the buildings in 25 years at no interest.
Families whose incomes fall below the poverty line will be exempt from the reinforcement fees.

British Firm Develops Software to Enhance Mobile Phone's Ability to Process Graphics
Xinhua News Agency, London, June 8 (Reporter Wang Yanhong)  A British wireless technology firm recently developed a graphics software exclusively for mobile phone games.
It is reported that the software can significantly enhance the mobile phone's ability to process graphics so as to improve the quality of mobile gaming and make it easier for gaming software developers to write game applications on mobile phone platforms.
Currently, quite a number of firms have started to test mobile phone gaming service.  However, many aspects of games such as quality of graphics and speed are still far from satisfactory.
The TTPCom, located in Cambridge, U.K., said that the new software they have developed can enable the mobile phone to display images at 15 frames per second.  Capable of processing multi-layered independent mobile graphics and supporting such effects as transparency, zooming and rotation, the software makes mobile gaming more attractive and helps handsets manufacturers and mobile communication providers attract more mobile gaming customers.
The firm said that they were prompted to develop this software when they found the core chips used by Japan's Nintendo in one of its handset games are the same as the chips used in 80% of the world's mobile phones, both using the technology from the British firm ARM.
Therefore, a specific technology may be used to dramatically improve the mobile phone's ability to process graphics.
At present, some game developers have already been working with TTPCom, and the mobile phones and game consoles using this technology are expected to hit the market within the year.

Heat Wave Hits Nigeria, Over 60 Dead
Xinhua News Agency, Lagos, June 10 (Reporter Dai Adi)  According to Nigeria's Radio Kaduna, Maiduguri, a city in northeastern Nigeria, was recently hit by a heat wave unseen in years.  Within only a week, more than 60 people died of the heat wave.
Quoting Kida, chief physician in the Medical School of the University of Maiduguri, the report said that the actual death toll could far exceed 60, because many of the families buried the victims of the heat wave without reporting at all to the local health agencies.
Maiduguri is the capital city of Borno state in northeastern Nigeria.  Most of its local residents are Muslims.
According to the local Islamic custom, the dead must be buried as soon as possible, otherwise they would not be able to go to Heaven.
Kida said most of those who succumbed to the heat wave were elderly with heart diseases.
According to the local weather station, the temperature in the recent week in Maiduguri has risen to as high as 55 to 60 degrees centigrade.
Kida said: "This high temperature is no doubt fatal to people with heart problems."
Though it is now already the rainy season in Nigeria, the rainy season in northern Nigeria this year is at least two months later than it was in preceding years, so that a large part of farmland is affected.
What is even worse is that due to the drought, infectious diseases have reached an epidemic level, driving the death toll even higher.
NYSE Nasdaq Indices Continued to Slip
Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 10  For lack of any major news that may influence the market, New York Stock Exchange fluctuated on the 10th.  While the Dow Jones index rallied when investors bought low, the Nasdaq index, affected by investors' concerns over terrorist attacks and a lowered estimate of Intel's performance, continued to slip.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index was up 55.73 points on the day to close at 9645.40.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 4.79 points to close at 1530.69.  Standard & Poor 500 index rose 3.21 points to close at 1030.74.
The NYSE composite index rallied on the day, yet both the American Stock Exchange market price index and Russell 2000 representing small businesses suffered losses.
Advancers are slightly above decliners at New York Stock Exchange, and the trading volume plunged from 1.81 billion shares of the previous trading day to 1.22 billion shares.
Before that, all the major stock indices at New York Stock Exchange had been sliding for three straight weeks.
Last week, the Dow Jones index shed another 3.4% while Nasdaq index took a 5% dive.
Under this circumstance, investors absorbed shares while prices were low on the 10th, temporarily pushing up the prices shortly after Wall Street opened.  Both Dow Jones index and S & P index rose beyond 1% for a time.
However, after the news came out that an American citizen linked to "al Qaeda" recently arrested in Chicago by the US government has attempted to make and plant a dirty bomb, investors again became highly alert about terrorist attacks and the market subsequently took a downward turn.
In addition, the news that Intel Corporation last week lowered the projected business revenue for this quarter continued to exert pressure on the tech shares, plunging the Nasdaq index to the lowest level since October of last year.

Earlier, French President Chirac and Prime Minister Raffarin sent telegrams respectively to the French team captain Desailly and the team, hoping the French soccer team will pull themselves together and "overcome defeat," and saluting them with "the highest respect and sincerest friendship."
Three Armed Palestinians Killed by Israeli Army
Xinhua News Agency, Gaza, June 11 (Reporter Wang Hao)  A Palestinian security official said that three armed Palestinians were killed by the Israeli military when they were trying to raid a Jewish settlement in the Central Gaza Strip on the late night of the 11th.
The security official said that the three armed Palestinians were found by the patrolling Israeli soldiers when they were about to carry out their raid after sneaking into the Jewish settlement.
Instantly, the two sides exchanged intense gunfires.
During the exchange of fires, the three armed Palestinians were all shot to death by the Israeli soldiers.
Shortly afterwards, the Israeli military closed Beach Boulevard that links the North and Central Gaza Strip.
The Palestinian security official also claimed that earlier that day three Palestinian children were also shot at the same location by Israeli soldiers.  One of them, an 8 years old, succumbed to serious wounds.
The Israeli military already admitted the incident and promised to investigate the case.
Gaza Strip covers an area of 360 sq. km inhabited by nearly 1.2 million Palestinians.  However, about 7,000 Israeli Jewish settlers occupy one third of the land and a large quantity of water resources in the area.
Since large-scale military clashes broke out between Palestine and Israel in September 2000, armed Palestinians have carried out endless attacks against the settlement.  The attacks have become even more frequent in the recent period.
Since the Israeli military ended its "Operation Defensive Shield" in the West Bank, about 10 armed Palestinians carrying out their raids have been killed so far by the Israeli military .

EU to Take Retaliatory Measures Against US over Steel Trade Dispute
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, June 18 (Reporter Tian Fan)  The European Commission announced on the 18th that it may take retaliatory measures against the United States over the EU-US steel trade dispute and has already officially notified the WTO of the issue.
The European Commission spokesman Gooch said at a press conference that after the European Commission has officially notified the WTO, "The EU can feel free to impose retaliatory tariffs on US products."
He noted at the same time that the EU's final decision on sanctions will be made after the European Commission informs governments of the EU member nations of its negotiations with the United States on July 18.
According to the relevant regulations, if the EU wants to impose retaliatory tariffs on US products, it must officially notify the WTO of its sanctions by the 18th of this month.
The US government announced in March this year that it would impose tariffs as high as 30% on steel product imports.  This has caused the resentment of many steel exporting nations, among whom the much-affected EU reacted most strongly.
The EU wanted the United States to repeal the high tariffs on steel imports or take trade compensatory measures.
At the same time it is bringing this lawsuit to the WTO, the EU has also drawn up a list of imports from the United States such as fruit juice and textiles upon which it plans to impose retaliatory tariffs.
Early this month, the WTO appointed a special panel to investigate the US-EU steel trade dispute.
On the 7th of this month, the US government announced 61 types of steel imports exempt from high tariffs and said it will announce additional lists of products exempt from high tariffs later on.
Meanwhile, analysts pointed out that the reason for the EU's notification of the WTO of its trade retaliatory measures is to put more pressure on the US government and force the United States into making more concessions in the EU-US steel trade dispute.

After more than a month of preparation, Fossett set out from Northam, western Australia and plans to fly a distance from 27,000 to 29,000 km.
In the meantime, he will almost traverse over all the oceans in the Southern Hemisphere.
A special panel composed of meteorologists, engineers and students from Washington University will be in charge of monitoring the flight plan in the US city of St Louis.
Fossett made the same kind of attempt in 2001.
He almost lost his life half way on his scheduled flight due to a storm.

Russia Faces Population Crisis
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 20 (Reporter Xie Rong)  Deputy Health Minister of Russia Yevgeny Dedkov said on the 20th that the death rate of Russia's population has surpassed its birth rate for 10 consecutive years.  With an annual decrease of 2 million in population, Russia is now facing a population crisis.

As presented by Dedkov, in the past 10 years, the rising death rate of Russia's population was mainly caused by the general deteriorating health conditions of the Russian residents.
During this period, the number of Russian residents afflicted with various kinds of diseases has dramatically increased.

Mt. Helan Becomes Precious Gene Pool of Animals and Plants in Northwestern China
Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, June 25 (Reporters Jiang Xuecheng and Li Yunlu)  With the continuous improvement of the ecological environment, Mt. Helan National Natural Reserve has become an authentic "precious gene pool of animals and plants in the northwestern region of China."
The reporter was told that at present, Mt. Helan National Natural Reserve boasts a resource of 868 species of wild animals and plants, of which the blue sheep under the state special protection has the highest concentration per square kilometer in the world.
Mt. Helan, stretching more than 250 km from south to north, is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia, the two large autonomous regions.  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China, it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current.
At one time, due to excessive herding and reckless deforestation, the ecological environment of the mountain area was severely damaged, and the resources of animals and plants significantly dwindled.
Since 1988, China has designated an area of about 2.3 million mu in Ningxia as national natural reserve.  In 1995, China and Germany also launched a joint "project of ecological shelter forest at the eastern foot of Mt. Helan."
This year, the overall enclosure of Mt. Helan and pasturing prohibition are officially listed as a natural forest conservation project in China's Western Development.
After the active enforcement of closing the mountain to nurse forests, afforestation and pasturing prohibition, the ecological environment here has seen remarkable improvements.  Various species of wild animals and plants are also under effective protection.
Sources from the natural reserve administration said that at present, forest coverage in Mt. Helan area has risen to 14% from less than 10% in the past.  690 species of wild plants grow and thrive in the reserve.  State-level rare plants such as the Mongolian almond tree, Tetraena mongolica and Ammopiptanthus mongolicus have substantially increased in numbers.
Currently, the number of the species of wild animals in Mt. Helan Natural Reserve has reached 170; the number of blue sheep alone has exceeded 10,000.
Foreign Investments in Niger on Rapid Rise
Xinhua News Agency, Lome, June 25 (Reporter Lin Feng)  From Niamey: as disclosed by a report recently released by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of Niger, in recent years, foreign investments in Niger have increased dramatically, rising from 433 million African Francs (about 700 African Francs equal one US dollar) in 1999 to 20.77 billion African Francs in 2001.
The report predicts that the aggregate amount of foreign investments in 2002 is expected to reach 49 billion African Francs, up 136% over the previous year.
The report points out that foreign investments are mainly concentrated in Niger's industries such as telecommunication, infrastucture construction, hotel industry, cement production, motorcycle assembling and footwear industries.
The report says that for years, foreign investments in Niger are chiefly from the EU nations such as France, Belgium, and Holland.  However, in the recent two years, there has been a dramatic increase in investments coming from China and Libya.
In 2002, the aggregate amount of investments from China and Libya in telecommunication, plastic, chemical and footwear industries has reached nearly 30 billion African Francs.
The report says that the domestic political situation has been moving towards stabilization ever since Niger successfully held a presidential election in 1999.
The Nigerien government has been working hard to crack down on the corruption and bureaucracy in the administration and actively promoting the market economy and privatization initiatives.  It has worked hard to change the state's monopoly over the market and manufacturing departments, develop small and medium-sized private businesses, and actively participate in the progress of the integrated regional economy.
In addition, the Nigerien government's efforts to actively implement a new foreign investment policy and constantly improve the environment for investments have also attracted a large amount of foreign investments.
Niger is one of the most underdeveloped countries declared by the United Nations.  Its national economy mainly depends on agriculture and husbandry.
According to the UN Human Development Index, of the 175 nations in the world, Niger is ranked second from the bottom.

The declaration points out that the anti-drug cooperation in the three places has achieved remarkable results, but further coordination of anti-drug legal assistance and police cooperation in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau are needed to solidify and expand the achievements of anti-drug cooperation.
Measures include: to establish a system of contact communication for anti-drug task forces, increase the timely exchange of anti-drug intelligence in the three places, set up an information sharing network, improve and standardize the assistance procedures in the three places for special tasks such as anti-drug enforcement, case investigation assistance, capture of drug ringleaders, seizure of narcotics and drug funds, and establish a quick response system for joint crackdown on cross-boundary drug trafficking.
At the same time, topics such as anti-drug propaganda, drug prevention and education, drug treatment and rehabilitation, construction of drug treatment facilities, control of chemicals that can be easily converted to drugs, and anti-drug legislation should be actively pursued and discussed so as to promote the mutual references and exchanges of experiences in the three places.

Operation of Sports Facilities in Guangzhou Goes Diversified
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 28 (Reporter Jia Wenjun)  How are the large number of sports facilities in Guangzhou maintaining their operations after the 9th National Sports Meet was over?  Zhang Huoying, vice secretary general  of Guangzhou Municipal Government said today that at present, the municipal sports facilities in Guangzhou have taken a big step in their strategic transition from public facilities to market-oriented business operations and their attempts at innovation in the management system.
In its efforts to host the 9th National Sports Meet, Guangzhou successively invested a total of 1.86 billion yuan in constructing five new sports facilities including Guangzhou Stadium and remodeling 15 old sports facilities including Tianhe Sports Center.
Guangdong Province also invested about 1.6 billion yuan in the construction of such facilities as Guangdong Olympic Center and Guangdong International Boating Center.
Single function, high cost and poor capacity of self-maintenance and development have been common problems with stadiums and sports centers .
In order to change this situation, Guangzhou, under the guideline of "sports-based comprehensive development," adjusted the structural composition and functional orientation of the newly-constructed and remodeled public sports facilities prior to the 9th National Sports Meet in an effort to achieve a multi-purpose integration of athletic, cultural, recreational and entertainment functions for these sports facilities.
According to the briefing, the diversified operation has become a current feature of all kinds of sports facilities in Guangzhou.
For example, the new Guangzhou Stadium has entrusted "Zhujiang Enterprise," a publicly traded company, to implement a business operation management system; the tennis facility in Fangchun District has adopted a system of contractual operation; and Liwan District Stadium has chosen a cooperative business operation.  All have achieved fine results.
Of course, some of the sports facilities still rely on government budgets.  Guangdong Olympic Center, for instance, needs an annual financial allocation of 30 million yuan from Guangdong Province for maintenance.

Economy in Panama Continues to Slide
Xinhua News Agency, Panama City, June 28  According to the local media news on the 28th, a report recently released by the Budget Commission of Panama's Legislative Assembly says that various kinds of data indicate Panama's economy at present shows no sign of any recovery and instead is continuing its slide into "recession."
The report points out that the Panamanian government has so far not taken any effective measures to solve the serious budget deficit and stimulate the economy out of recession.
The report shows the economic downturn has substantially reduced Panama's revenue.
The first quarter of this year was expected to bring 1.19 billion US dollars in taxes, yet only 880 million US dollars was actually collected, with a shortfall hitting 310 million US dollars.
The Panamanian government has decided to cut this year's public expenses by 150 million US dollars, but this would affect the investment in the public services.
The report by the Budget Commission of Panama's Legislative Assembly holds that the widespread government corruption, the government's inability to come up with effective plans of economic development, and failure to implement the investment projects already planned are among the main reasons that Panama's economy has been deteriorating year after year.
Since the current Panamanian government took office in 1999, the economic growth rate in Panama has been declining every year.  From 1998 to 2001, the growth rate was 4.2%, 3.2%, 2.7% and 0.3% respectively.
The Panamanian government estimates that the economic growth rate for this year is from 1.0% to 1.5%.  However, according to the most recent estimates from the private assessment firms in Panama, the growth rate of economy this year may even become negative while the unemployment rate will also rise.
