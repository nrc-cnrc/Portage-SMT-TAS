2.11 End-of-Line Handling

XML parsed entities are often stored in computer files which, for editing
convenience, are organized into lines. These lines are typically separated by
some combination of the characters CARRIAGE RETURN (#xD) and LINE FEED (#xA).

To simplify the tasks of applications, the XML processor must behave as if it
normalized all line breaks in external parsed entities (including the document
entity) on input, before parsing, by translating both the two-character
sequence #xD #xA and any #xD that is not followed by #xA to a single #xA
character.
