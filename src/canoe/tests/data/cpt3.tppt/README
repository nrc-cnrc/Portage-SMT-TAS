The five files tppt, cbk, src.tdx, trg.tdx and trg.repos.dat, together,
constitute a single TPPT model.  You must keep them together in a directory
called NAME.tppt for the model to work properly.  They cannot be used
compressed.

To use this model in canoe, put a line like this is your canoe.ini file:
   [ttable-tppt] NAME.tppt



The additional file config provides the semantic interpretation of the columns
in the TPPT, supporting 4th column scores and count fields.  Support for
alignments is planned but not implemented yet.
