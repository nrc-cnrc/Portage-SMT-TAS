Conventions in Documentation and Code
=====================================

 - The translation input is the source text, the output is the target text.
 - The first word in a sentence is considered to be at position 0; (hence, the
   last word is at position numWords - 1)
 - A range of words is specified by [i, j), where i is the first word in the
   range and j is the first word NOT in the range.
