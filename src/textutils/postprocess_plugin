# Suggestion: for an English->French system, you could use fix-en-fr-numbers.pl
# to patch numbers, reformatting them from English to French style.
# Uncomment the following line to activate:
#fix-en-fr-numbers.pl |

# Suggestion: insert non-breaking spaces where needed in French.

# Uncomment the following block of lines to activate, and modify to suit your
# needs; you can leave lines that don't apply to you in comments.
