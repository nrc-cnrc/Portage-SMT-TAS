# Creating the initial asciidoc source for the PortageII user manual

# Done by Eric Joanis, following the initial recipe provided by Patrick Paul

# pandoc: required only for initial conversion
sudo yum install pandoc
# asciidoc: required to make the manual
sudo yum install asciidoc

# Make a fresh snapshot and copy it
open in a browser: http://wiki-ilt/PORTAGEshared/scripts/restricted/ywiki.cgi?act=snapshot
cd <PORTAGEshared sandbox>/src/user_manual
rsync -arz wiki-ilt:/export/projets/Lizzy/PORTAGEshared/snapshot .

# Convert the .html files to .adoc
# Sources of errors detected and fixed:
# - input encoding is iso-8859-1, pandoc required utf-8
# - a line in the Lizzy source with a space and nothing else can cause the
#   insertion of an empty <PRE></PRE> block in the html snapshot, which causes
#   pandoc to say "pandoc: Prelude.maximum: empty list" and output nothing.
#   Solution: manually grep for these in the Lizzy source files; use the Lizzy
#   edit interface to fix them manually; start from a fresh snapshot again.
mkdir asciidoc
for i in snapshot/pages/*.html; do
   bn=$(basename $i .html)
   echo $bn
   iconv -t utf-8 -f iso-8859-1 < $i |
      pandoc -f html -t asciidoc > asciidoc/$bn.adoc
done

# Bring over the uploaded files - this might cause problems later - to be
# figured out...
mkdir html
cp -ar snapshot/uploads html/

# Repair some artefacts of the HTML snapshot

# Manual repairs:
#  - Edit asciidoc/PORTAGE_sharedFAQ.adoc and remove the line break in the
#    middle of the long section titles (i.e., questions).
#  - Use image:: instead of image: to get block images (fixes problems with
#    images not being visible in Overview page.
#  - Fix the copyright block and move it to asciidoc/footer.adoc, using 
#    include::footer.adoc[]
#    in each source file where we want it.
#  - Similarly move the header image to asciidoc/header.adoc.
#  - List items need to have their text start on the same line as the * or
#    ** that marks them.

# Generate new HTML from the asciidoc sources - this will eventually have to be
# turned into a target triggered by "make docs".
