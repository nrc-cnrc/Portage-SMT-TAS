Programming Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The guidelines presented here represent conventions we would like all
programmers to follow. These are not hard-and-fast rules, but please
adhere to these as much as possible when you contribute to Portage or
PortageII. If you wish to add to these guidelines, feel free to
discuss it with the other project members, and add them if there is a
consensus.

The PORTAGE environment variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Programs and scripts should NOT hardcode `/path/to/PortageII`. The best
strategy is to assume that locations are implicitly available via
standard environment variables like `PATH`. E.g., if your perl script
calls a program `translate-perfectly`, don't call it like
`/path/to/PortageII/bin/translate-perfectly` or
`$MYPATH/translate-perfectly`, just say `translate-perfectly`. For
special-purpose things like references to corpora and data files, assume
that the environment variable `PORTAGE` points to the project root
directory. Apart from standard external libraries, code should not have
external dependencies (e.g., to something in a user's home directory).

C++ conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* C++ programs should use the `Portage` namespace, and include
`portage_defs.h` which defines this and a few other things. Note that
this namespace does a _using std_, so you don't need explicit
qualifications on things from the std library (though you must avoid
duplicating std names). Please avoid _using std_ statements in include
files outside the Portage namespace.
* C++ class names should have each word capitalized, with no _ between
words. E.g., `DecoderState`.
* C++ files should be all lowercase, with _ between each word. E.g.,
`decoder_state.h`.
* All libraries should begin with `portage`, e.g., the `utils` module
defines the `portage_utils.a` library.
* Avoid unnecessary const references in method/function parameters. For
example, write fn(double w, Uint x, T* y, const T* z) rather than
fn(const double& w, const Uint& x, T* const &y, const T* const& z). The
first version has the same effective semantics but is more efficient.
* Includes for non-Portage files should use angle braces, whereas
includes for Portage files, even in different directories, should all
use double quotes.
* C standard libraries should all be included using their cxyz header,
not the obsolete xyz.h headers. E.g., include cmath, cstdlib, ctype,
etc.
* For floating point numbers, we prefer to use doubles for the actual
calculations (local and temporary variables), but in actual models (TM,
LM, etc.) we use floats to save memory, since these models can get very
large.
* The use of boost libraries is encouraged when the value added is
significant, but please make sure you can't do the same work easily
yourself, however, because boost libraries are very expensive to
compile.
* Use the `MagicStream` classes for all I/O, if possible. These
automatically handle compressed files and pipes for the user.

Script conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Script (bash, perl, etc) file names should be all lowercase with -
(hyphen, not underscore) between each word, and an appropriate
extension. E.g., `run-parallel.sh`.

Documentation conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Document your code! Write the documentation first, then the code!
* Update the documentation for any code you modify!
* Put a Copyright header at the top of all source files, with the
correct year, accurately reflecting the ownership of the code within the
file.
* Put the standard file/brief description/author header at the top of
all source files, with the author name and the program name accurately
describing that particular file.
* Your `.h` files should follow the _doxygen_ documentation conventions
(see existing `.h` files for many examples).
* Your `.cc` files can have minimal documentation if your code is clear,
but explain tricky, complicated and non-obvious things you write.

Formatting conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Avoid tab characters in your files, since they don't always display
consistently. If you must use them, set your tab width to 8 in your
editor.
** Vi tip: put "set expandtab tabstop=8" in your .vimrc file.
** Emacs tip: put "(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)" and "(setq
tab-width 8)" in your .emacs file.
* Usually indent with 3 spaces.
** Vi tip: put "set shiftwidth=3 autoindent" in your .vimrc file.
** Emacs tip: _any emacs user knows?_
* Avoid accented characters in source files, since we all use different
default encodings! Thus, "Majeste" and "langagieres" should be written
(incorrectly, it is true) without their accent in source code.
Exception: source files for language specific processing where the
encoding is semantically significant and used consistently in code, data
and/or comments, such as utokenize.pl and tokenize.pl.

Unit testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We now have a unit testing framework in place. It is very easy to use,
so please create a test suite for any new class you write. See the
documented example `src/utils/tests/test_your_class.h` for details.
* If a unit test suite takes too long to run, create a new directory
under `test-suite/unit-testing` and write a `go.sh` script or a
`Makefile` that runs the tests and reports if they are successful.
* Some unit testing used to be done in various programs called `test*`,
but we are phasing those out, please use either of the two methods
described above instead.

Regression testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before committing your code, use the `regress-small-voc` or `toy` test
suite to make sure it works.

Git diff
^^^^^^^^

Before committing your code, do a Git diff (or equivalent command for
your code repository software) to make sure you agree your changes are
what you think they are.

Feature and model naming conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you need to create a complex syntax for a new type of feature or
model in any program in PortageII, please follow the conventions
used in existing models:

* The colon (`:`) is the standard list separator. It is used in `canoe.ini` in
particular. It is also used in rescoring models to separate the name of
a feature from its arguments.
* The number sign (`\#`) is the standard argument separator. For example,
the LM base class interprets `#_N_` as a request to limit the order, e.g.
`lm_4gram_en.gz#3` treats this LM as a 3-gram LM even if it is a 4-gram
LM.  This separator is also used by many rescoring feature functions; see
`rescore_train -H` for details.
* The semi-colon (`;`) is the alternative argument separator, to use when the
number sign would be ambiguous. For example, complex LM classes such as
`DynMapLM` use it to separate the `DynMap` tag, the type of map and the
filename. The number sign could not be used here because LM classes already use
it for a different meaning (see above).
* Exceptionally, the `FileFF` feature separates the column argument from
the filename argument with a comma (`,`), but the parser looks explicitly for a
comma followed by a number at the end of the string, so as to allow
maximum flexibility in the file name itself. The comma should be avoided
as a separator elsewhere.

Help messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every program should produce a useful help message when invoked with
`-h`. This help message should be formatted as follows:

* Each line should be at most 79 characters wide
* The first line is a synopsis giving the program name, `[options]` if
it takes any, and the arguments in all caps, with optional ones in
square brackets.
* The next paragraph is a description of the program, indented with two
spaces.
* Then a section labelled `Options:` lists each option, also indented
two spaces, with its argument (if any) immediately after in all-caps,
and then a description of what the option does.
* Example:
+
-------------------------------------------
program [options] ARG1 ARG2 [OPTIONAL_ARG3]

  Description of what program does.

Options:
  -opt1 A1   use A1 to do x
  -opt2      do blah
  -opt3 XYZ  do something with XYZ
-------------------------------------------
