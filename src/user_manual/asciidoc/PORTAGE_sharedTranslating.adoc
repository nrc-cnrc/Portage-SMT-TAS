*Note:* this section does not reflect current best practice. The whole
translation pipeline is now automated in our experimental framework for
translation during training, and in script `translate.pl` for use in
Portage**Live. Please read `tutorial.pdf` in `framework` and the
link:PortageLiveManual.html[Portage Live Manual].

Translating
~~~~~~~~~~~

Source texts to be translated by PORTAGE shared must be in
link:PORTAGE_sharedFileFormats.html#TokenizedText[Tokenized
Text] or
link:PORTAGE_sharedFileFormats.html#MarkedUpText[Marked Up
Text] formats; the
link:PORTAGE_sharedTextProcessing.html#TextProcessing[Text
Processing] section describes the required processing steps. Translation
itself consists of three main steps, of which the last two are optional:
decoding, rescoring, and postprocessing.
