PortageLive Customization using Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PortageLive supports many customizations to handle situations that are
specific to a given system correctly. These customizations are enabled
through seven plugins that can be installed with each deployed system.

The default plugins have changed significantly in versions 2.2 and 3.0
of PortageII. `doc/PortageAPIComparison.pdf` contains a comparison
chart documenting the recent improvements to the plugins. If you have
custom plugins, even if provided by the NRC, we strongly recommend you
review the new default plugins and consider using them instead. The 3.0
plugins roll in most custom processing we've provided in response to
client requests in the past and should work well for most situations.

Installing custom plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default version of these plugins already does some processing. If
you want to turn on or off a particular aspect, you need to

1.  make a copy of the plugin into the trained system's `plugins`
directory: `framework/plugins/` during training,
`/opt/PortageII/models/_context_/plugins/` in a deployed system. The
default plugins are found in PortageII's bin/ directory.
2.  edit the copy to change what processing it actually performs.

The main plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are the four main plugins, in the order PortageLive calls them:

1.  `preprocess_plugin` does some automated data cleanup and
normalization. By default, it also splits slash-separated words, such as
"before/after". To turn off *slash separation*, edit the plugin and
comment out the line that reads `FIX_SLASHES=1`.
2.  `predecode_plugin` is used to insert rule-based translation
instructions, e.g., for translating numbers and applying fixed-term
lists. For English-French and French-English system, *rule-based
translation of numbers* is done by default. To turn that behaviour off,
comment out the line that read `MARK_NUMBERS_ENFR=1`. See
<<Fixed Terms>> below for instructions on turning on *fixed-term rules*.
3.  `postdecode_plugin` is a place-holder for future use; don't use it.
4.  `postprocess_plugin` is used to make changes to the final output,
just before returning it to the user. By default, it inserts
*non-breaking spaces* where appropriate in French output (disable this
feature by commenting out `ADD_FR_NBSP=1`). It can optionally fix the
*formatting of numbers in French*, as an alternative to the rule-based
option mentioned above: uncomment the line `fix-en-fr-numbers.pl |` to
enable this. It can also insert *non-breaking hyphens* in selected
patterns, such as in short hyphenated codes: this is more complicated
because it depends on how your application represents these, but the
default plugin includes commented-out sample code for several options
we're aware of.

Tokenization plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PortageII tokenizer and detokenizer supports French, English,
Spanish, and Danish. For other languages, three additional plugins
required:

1.  `sentsplit_plugin` is used to perform sentence splitting on a
source-language paragraph. It supports Arabic and Chinese by default.
2.  `tokenize_plugin` is used to perform tokenization of source language
text. It works on Chinese out of the box. It supports Arabic with some
additional installation work; ask us if you need this.
3.  `detokenize_plugin` is used to perform detokenization of target
language output.

Fixed Terms
^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with version 2.2, PortageII can handle a list of fixed
terms, which are used to bypass the translation system for fixed
expressions that should not be translated statistically.

The purpose of the fixed-terms module is to handle specific brand names,
proper names and other terms that accept no variations and must be
systematically translated exactly the same way.

Limitations:

* No morphological processing of any kind is done. This is not intended
for terms with morphological variants, although source-language variants
can be entered as separate fixed terms.
* A given term can only have one translation.
* No disambiguation will be performed: if the given term appears in text
to translate, it will get its fixed translation even when that might not
have been appropriate. Therefore, make sure not to enter text that can
sometimes be used in a different way.
* The fixed-terms list is lower-cased, and it is applied to text to
translate after lowercasing. Therefore, there is no way to distinguish
between "Rice" and "rice" or between "US" and "us". Therefore, make sure
to add enough context to make your fixed terms unambiguous, e.g., "Mr.
Rice" instead of "Rice".

*Important warning*: do *not* upload your whole terminology database as
a fixed-terms list. The results will be disastrous. The fixed-terms
system completely bypasses all statistical learning abilities of PORTAGE
shared and is only appropriate for carefully selected, fully
disambiguated cases.

Installation:

To enable the fixed-terms functionality:

* A directory `plugins/fixedTerms/` must also exist and be readable,
writable and executable by the Apache process. This is automatically
done for systems trained with PortageII 2.2 or more recent. We
provide a script to retrofit systems trained with earlier versions: run
+
------------------------
prep-fixedTerms-layout.sh /opt/PortageII/models/system-name
------------------------
+
for each pre-existing system to create this directory and set its
permissions correctly.
* The `predecode_plugin` must be included in each system that might
handle fixed terms, by copying it into its `plugins/` directory as
documented above in section <<Installing custom plugins>>:
+
------------------------------------
cp /opt/PortageII/bin/predecode_plugin /opt/PortageII/models/context/plugins/
------------------------------------
+
Make sure you use the plugin from PortageII version 3.0 or later,
and decide whether you want rule-based English-French number translation
when you install that plugin, since the same plugin controls both
features.
* Systems trained with old versions of PortageII might have the
`[bypass-marked]` parameter set in their `canoe.ini.cow` file. This must
be removed or replaced by `[no-bypass-marked]`:
+
-------------------------------------
sed -i 's/bypass-marked/no-bypass-marked/' /opt/PortageII/models/system-name/canoe.ini.cow
-------------------------------------

Once the fixed-terms functionality is enabled, you can upload a
fixed-terms database through the PortageLive API. This is meant to be
called from a client application that should generate this file
automatically from a more user-friendly database. We only give a brief
description of the operations here; see the API documentation for more
details.

* Use the `updateFixedTerms()` method to initialize or update the
database. The fixed-terms list must be prepared in a tab-separated file
where the first line contains:
+
--------------------
source language code<TAB>the target language code
--------------------
+
and each subsequent line contains:
+
-----------------
a source term<TAB>the term's translation
-----------------
+
e.g. (where <TAB> must be replaced by literal tab characters):
+
--------------------
eng<TAB>fra
this is a pointless term<TAB>ce terme est inutile
--------------------
* Use the `removeFixedTerms()` method to delete the fixed-terms list and
turn off fixed-terms handling.
* Use the `getFixedTerms()` method to query the system for its current
fixed-terms list.

After all this, you should see the behaviour of your system changed to
take into account the fixed terms you defined.

Alternatively, you can manually compile and install the fixed-terms
database on your PortageLive server:

* copy the fixed-terms list to the PortageLive server into file
`/opt/PortageII/models/_system-name_/plugins/fixedTerms/fixedTerms`

* compile the fixed-terms list into file
`/opt/PortageII/models/_system-name_/plugins/fixedTerms/tm`:
+
---------------------------
cd /opt/PortageII/models/system-name/plugins/fixedTerms/
---------------------------
+
for en->fr systems, assuming you place English in the first column, use this command:
+
----------------------------------------
fixed_term2tm.pl -source_column=1 -source=en -target=fr fixedTerms | sort --unique > tm
----------------------------------------
+
for fr->en systems, assuming you place English in the first column, use this command:
+
----------------------------------------
fixed_term2tm.pl -source_column=2 -source=fr -target=en fixedTerms | sort --unique > tm
----------------------------------------

* the example file above, compiled, will look like this if things worked correctly:
** en->fr:
+
-----------------------------------------
this is a pointless term ||| <FT target="ce terme est inutile">this is a pointless term</FT> ||| 1 1
-----------------------------------------
** fr->en:
+
-------------------------------------------
ce terme est inutile ||| <FT target="this is a pointless term">ce terme est inutile</FT> ||| 1 1
-------------------------------------------
