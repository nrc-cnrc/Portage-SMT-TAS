Translating: Decoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command `canoe -h` describes how to run the decoder. Here we assume
you already trained your models and tuned them, with the results of
`tune.py` available in model file `canoe.ini.cow`.

If you are translating French text that is already preprocessed,
sentence-split and tokenized, say `test_fr.tok`, into English, this
command does the decoding step:

--------------------------------------------------
   canoe-escapes.pl -add text_fr.tok text_fr.rule
   canoe -f canoe.ini < text_fr.rule > text_en.out
--------------------------------------------------

See link:UsingPhrasetablesInCanoe.html[Using Phrasetables In
Canoe] for more information on using multiple phrasetables in canoe.

If the source file contains
link:PORTAGE_sharedFileFormats.html#MarkedUpText[Marked Up
Text], then any translations specified in markup are used instead of
those provided by the translation model, unless the `-bypass-marked`
switch is given to canoe, in which case the two are combined. (If you
use rules, don't use `canoe-escapes.pl`; your rule-creating software
should escape any `<`, `>` and `\` meant to be interpreted literally.)

Running canoe on the untuned model will yield very bad results, so don't
do it unless you're working on a new optimization technique. The tuning
procedure described in
link:PORTAGE_sharedTrainingOptimizingWeights.html#TrainingOptimizingWeights[Optimizing
Weights] sets optimized value for all the model weights. In general, the
remaining parameters such as `beam-threshold` and `ttable-limit` control
the trade-off between accuracy and speed: they should be set to values
that give a good compromise between quality and speed for your
application.
