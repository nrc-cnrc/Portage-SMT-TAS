Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before proceeding with this manual, you should read the `INSTALL` and
`README` files at the root of the PORTAGE shared distribution.

Once PORTAGE shared is installed on your system, you should make sure
you source the `SETUP.bash` or `SETUP.tcsh` file before you run any
software. You need to do this in every shell you open, so we recommend
doing it in your `.bashrc` or `.tcshrc` file:

---------------------------------------
   source /path/to/PortageII/SETUP.bash
---------------------------------------

or, for tcsh users:

---------------------------------------
   source /path/to/PortageII/SETUP.tcsh
---------------------------------------

These files set up the `PATH`, `PERL5LIB`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and
`PORTAGE` variables as required to run PORTAGE shared software.

Where To Find Things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every path given below is relative to the root `PortageII` directory.

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Project documentation can be found in various places.

* The experimental framework, located in `framework`, includes a
tutorial showing step by step instructions on how to use PORTAGE shared
on toy data, following our current recommendations for software
settings. This is the recommended starting point for your experiments.
See `tutorial.pdf` in `framework` for details. If you have done previous
work with PORTAGE shared outside the framework, we recommend you try
switching to this framework instead, if that's feasible.

* Installation instructions can be found in `INSTALL`.

* Each program in the PORTAGE shared suite will produce useful
information when invoked with the `-h` switch. In some cases, this
information is very detailed, in particular for `canoe`, `cow.sh`,
`rat.sh`, so it is worth using the -h switch for most programs you use.
These usage messages can also be found in `doc/usage.html`, organized
alphabetically and by module.

* If your PORTAGE shared distro has source code, the `src/htmldoc`
directory has code documentation, automatically generated from the
source files. To access this documentation, start at
`doc/code-documentation.html`. You can regenerate it by typing
`make doxy` in the `src` directory if you have `doxygen`.

* The `doc` directory has PDF documents with in depth (though somewhat
out of date) documentation of the decoder and the rescoring program.

* Most directories have their own `README` file with additional details.

* The set of pages you are reading is the a somewhat obsolete user
manual, going through the whole process of using PORTAGE shared, but not
following the currently recommended practice.

Experimental Framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `framework` directory has a complete experimental framework that can
be used both as a tutorial for learning how to use PORTAGE shared, and
as a starting point for your own experiments. It uses `make` to run all
the software. It is cluster aware, as long as you can schedule jobs via
`qsub` on your cluster.

We regularly maintain this framework so that its defaults reflect our
current recommendations as to how best to use PORTAGE shared, at least
for typical use. Your data and use cases may work better with different
settings, but we try to make the framework a decent "out of the box"
configuration for many situations.

The tutorial included with the framework has recommendations on how you
can configure the framework for your own needs and is a must-read for
using the framework effectively.

Programs
^^^^^^^^

Unless you have a binary distribution, programs are generated by you
when you build PORTAGE shared, and normally end up in the `bin` sub
directory. To use them, you need to set some environment variables, as
described in the `INSTALL` file. For more details on how to build
PORTAGE shared, see link:PORTAGE_sharedWritingCode.html[Writing
Code].

Source Code
^^^^^^^^^^^

Source code is in the `src` directory, if it is included with your
distribution.

Test Suites
^^^^^^^^^^^

The `test-suite` directory contains a few test suites. `unit-testing`
contains several unit test suites meant to validate various parts of the
code. `regress-small-voc` is an out-of-date regression test suite,
previously used for assessing the impact of code changes.
`rescoring-example` gives an out-of-date sample use of the rescoring
tools in PORTAGE shared. (The new `rescore.py` rescoring script brings
together all the rescoring tools in an single, unified interface.)
