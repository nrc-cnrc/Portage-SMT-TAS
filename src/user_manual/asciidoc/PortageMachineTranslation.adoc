Portage Machine Translation
---------------------------

Software for Statistical Machine Translation.

PortageII 4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PortageII series includes several leaps forward in NRC's SMT
technology.

Version 4.0 adds NNJM training software and incremental document models to the system.

With Neural Network Joint Models (NNJM), version 3.0 brings deep
learning to the set of tools used to improve machine translation
quality, as well as NRC's improved reordering model based on sparse
features, coarse LMs, and other improvements. The NRC has put
significant efforts in optimizing the default training parameters to
improve the quality of the translations produced by PortageII, and
we expect users to see and appreciate the difference.

With PortageII 2.0, we added two important features to help translators:
the transfer of markup tags from the source sentence to the machine
translation output, as well as handling the increasingly common xliff
file format. 2.1 and 2.2 were maintenance releases incorporating minor
patches.

With PortageII 1.0, we brought in significant improvements to translation
engine that resulted in better translations, and contributed to our
success at the NIST Open Machine Translation 2012 Evaluation
(`OpenMT12`).

See file RELEASES for full details. See also
`doc/PortageAPIComparison.pdf` for a series of tables showing the
evolution of the API, the plugin architecture and the training
configuration for PortageII versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and 4.0.
