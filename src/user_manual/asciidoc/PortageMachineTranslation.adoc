Portage Machine Translation
---------------------------

Software for Statistical Machine Translation.

PORTAGE shared 3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PORTAGE shared series includes several leaps forward in NRC's SMT
technology.

With Neural Network Joint Models (NNJM), version 3.0 brings deep
learning to the set of tools used to improve machine translation
quality, as well as NRC's improved reordering model based on sparse
features, coarse LM**s, and other improvements. The NRC has put
significant efforts in optimizing the default training parameters to
improve the quality of the translations produced by PORTAGE shared, and
we expect users to see and appreciate the difference.

With version 2.0, we added two important features to help translators:
the transfer of markup tags from the source sentence to the machine
translation output, as well as handling the increasingly common xliff
file format. 2.1 and 2.2 were maintenance releases incorporating minor
patches.

With version 1.0, we brought in significant improvements to translation
engine that resulted in better translations, and contributed to our
success at the NIST Open Machine Translation 2012 Evaluation
(`OpenMT12`).

See file RELEASES for full details. See also
`doc/PortageAPIComparison.pdf` for a series of tables showing the
evolution of the API, the plugin architecture and the training
configuration for PORTAGE shared versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0.
