Translating: Rescoring Nbest Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The quality of raw output from canoe can be improved by having it
generate nbest lists and reordering them using a rescoring model.

Rescoring Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like for training a rescoring model, the `rescore.py` script can be used
to run all steps in rescored translation: nbest-list generation,
feature-file generation, and nbest rescoring to select the best
candidates. Assuming a rescoring model, `rescore-model.rat`, has been
trained using the procedure described in the
link:PORTAGE_sharedTrainingOptimizingWeights.html#RescoringScript[Rescoring
Script] section, the following command will write a final translation to
the file `text_fr.rule.rat`:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
rescore.py -trans --nbest-size 1000 -f canoe.ini.cow -msrc text_fr.rule \
   rescore-model.rat text_fr.tok text_en*.al >& log.rat-trans
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the nbest list size (1000 in this example) should match the
size used for training, although this is not obligatory. Also, the
reference files `text_en*.al` are optional; when they are provided, rat
will write the BLEU score for the final rescored translation to its
standard output.
