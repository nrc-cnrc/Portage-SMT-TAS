PortageII includes a sentence-level confidence estimation (CE)
layer. The purpose of CE in this context is to produce a value --
typically a real-valued number between 0 and 1 -- that reflects the
translation system's belief that it has done a Good Job. This number can
then be used for various things, for example filtering out lower-quality
or dubious machine translations, prioritizing post-editing effort, etc.

The user manual for the CE module has not been converted to the format
of this manual. It can be found in a plain text file in
`src/confidence/README` (distributions with source code) and
`doc/confidence/README` (all distributions).
