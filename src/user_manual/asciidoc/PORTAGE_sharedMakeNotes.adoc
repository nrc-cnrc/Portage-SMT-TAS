Some notes about using GNU make for the PORTAGE shared project.

* To specify an install path other than your home directory, use:
+
----------------------------------------------
make INSTALL_PATH=/path/to/install/dir install
----------------------------------------------

* To specify additional compiler flags on the make command line, supply
a value for the CF variable on the command line:
+
-------------------
make CF=-g <target>
-------------------

* To run the commands in parallel on the multiple `CPUs` of a machine,
use -j N. Don't use "-j" alone if other users are using the same
machine, because then make will run as many jobs in parallel as it can!
N = 1 + number of `CPUs` on the machine seems optimal:
+
------------------
make -j 5 <target>
------------------

* To add module or directory specific options, e.g., to turn off
warnings you know are not a problem or due to an external package, add
these flags to `MODULE_CF` in Makefile in that directory.

* Standard targets automatically available to each subdirectory:
+
`all`
+
compile everything.
+
`clean`
+
remove all compiled files.
+
`new`
+
make everything from scratch, i.e., make clean then make all.
+
`install`
+
make all and then install everything needed to run PORTAGE shared.
+
`new_install `
+
make clean and then make install.
+
`export`
+
make all and then install libraries and include files.
+
`doxy`
+
make the code documentation.

* To speed up builds for debugging, you can make and install one sub
directory and all its dependencies (direct and indirect) by using the
`OT` variable ("Overall Target") of the main Makefile. For example, the
following command, executed in your `PortageII/src` directory, runs
`make install` in `canoe` and the directories it depends on:
+
---------------------
make OT=install canoe
---------------------

* To speed up incremental builds further, you can use
+
----------------
make <dir>/progs
----------------
+
to make only the libraries `<dir>` directly depends on, and then a full
build in `<dir>`. Furthermore,
+
----------------
make <dir>/<pgm>
----------------
+
will do the strict minimum amount of work required to build the program
`<dir>/<pgm>`. For example:
+
-----------------
make tm/train_ibm
-----------------
+
Caveat: do not specify more than one such target at a time - running
`make -j 5 tm/train_ibm canoe/canoe` will most likely corrupt compiled
files in your sandbox and require a `make clean` to recover. Run these
two sequentially instead: `make tm/train_ibm canoe/canoe` (no `-j`) or
`make -j 5 tm/train_ibm; make -j 5 canoe/canoe`.
