Here is how unaligned words are handled throughout the phrase-extraction
process.

1. During IBM training, NULL words are prepended explicitly to source
   sentences. This isn't an option in train_ibm, so IBM1, IBM2, and HMM models
   are always trained with NULLs.

2. Asymmetrical alignment uses a single IBM model trained in one translation
   direction to link each "source" word to either a single "target" word or
   NULL. NULL links will only be made if the model has implicit NULL handling
   enabled, which it will if it is detected to have been trained with NULLs in
   the first place (which will always be the case, absent drastic measures like
   grepping NULL lines out of the ttable).

3. Symmetrization produces the final word alignment from two asymmetrical
   alignments. Each word in the final symmetrized alignment (documented in
   WordAligner::align()) must be in one of three different states:

   1) It is linked to one or more other words
   2) It is not linked
   3) It is explicitly assigned a "no-translation" status.

   These states are significant in phrase extraction, as described below. The
   way they are assigned depends on the symmetrization algorithm used:

   IBMOchAligner first makes all links in the intersection of the two input
   alignments, then expands to diagonally-connected links in the union, then
   links any remaining unaligned words from the union. The process can
   optionally be stopped after any of these steps. In general the result is an
   alignment in which some words are linked, some are not linked (if the
   algorithm is stopped after the 1st or 2nd step), and some are linked to
   NULL. These possibilities correspond to states 1, 2, and 3 above,
   respectively. The "exclude" option can be used to convert all unlinked
   (state 2) words to untranslated (state 3) words.

   PosteriorAligner first computes posterior probabilities for all possible
   links using each of the input alignments. It then multiplies the posteriors
   to get a final link score, and assigns status depending on two thresholds:
   scores above a higher "delta" threshold result in links, those below do not,
   and words whose links are ALL below a lower "exclude-threshold" are assigned
   no-translation status (state 3).

4. Phrase extraction (via the WordAligner::addPhrases() function) will extract
   all phrase pairs that do not have an external link. Unlinked words (state 2)
   act as "joiner" words in this algorithm, augmenting any phrase pair that is
   legal for adjacent words. Untranslated words (state 3) are "splitter" words:
   they never form part of a phrase.
